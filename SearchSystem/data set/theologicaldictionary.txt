PREFACE. 



lk.NOWLEDGE, in a gi-eat measure, foiins the true dignity and happiness of 
man : it is that by which he holds an honourable rank in the scale of being, and 
by which he is rendered capable of adding to the felicity of his fellow-creatures. 
Every attempt, therefore, to enlarge its boundaries, and facilitate its acquisition, 
must be considered as worthy of our attention and regard. The present work 
is designed to promote these valuable and impoitant ends. 

The plan of conveying knowledge by dictionaries has been long established, and 
well received in the republic of letters. A dictionary, however, of a religious and 
ecclesiastical nature was still a desideratum in the religious world ; for although 
we have had dictionaries which explained Scripture terms, yet it is evident these 
could not embrace the history of the church since the sacred canon was con- 
cluded, nor explain the numei'ous terms which have been used ; nor, indeed, point 
out the various sects and denominations which have subsisted since that time. I 
do not mean, by these remarks, to depreciate the valuable works above referred 
to: I am sensible of their excellencies, and I have no wish to undervalue them in 
order to exalt my own. This work, however, is of a different nature, as the reader 
will easily see, if he takes the trouble to compare and examine. 

There may, doubtless, be defects in this publication which may have escaped 
my attention ; but whoever considers the various books that must have been con- 
sulted ; the discriminations that were necessary to be made ; the patient investi- 
gation required ; and the toil of selecting, transcribing, and coniposing, must be 
convinced that it has been attended with no small difficulty. The advantages, 
however, which my own mind derived from the work, and the probability of its 
being useful to others, greatly encouraged me in its prosecution. Besides, to be 
active, to be useful, to do soi7iething for the good of mankind, 1 have always con- 
sidered as the honour of an intelligent being. It is not the student wrapt lip in 
metaphysical subtilties ; it is not the recluse living in pei-petual solitude ; it is 
not the miser who is continually amassing wealth, that can be considered as the 
greatest ornaments or the greatest blessings to human society : — it is rather the 
useful than the shining talent that is to be coveted. 

Perhaps it may be said, the work is tinctured too much with my own sentiments, 
and that the theologj^ is too antiquated to please a liberal, philosophismg, and re- 
fined age. In answer to this, I observe, that I could do no other, as an honest man, 
than communicate Avhat I believed to be the truth. It is a false liberality to ac- 
quiesce with every man's opinion, to fall in with every man's scheme, to trifle 
with error, or imagine there is no diiFerence between one sentiment and another.- 
yet, notwithstanding this declaration, I trust the features of bigotry are not easily 
discernible in this work ; and that, while I have endeavoured to cany the torch 
of Truth in my hand, I have not forgotten to walk in the path of Candour. 

It is almost needless here to say, that I have availed myself of all the writings 
of the best and most eminent authors I could obtain. Whatever has struck me as 
impoi-^ant in ecclesiastical history ; whatever good and accurate in definition ; 
whatever just views of the passions of the human mind; whatever terms used in 
the religious world ; and whatever instructive and impressive in the systems of 
divinity and moral philosophy, I have endeavoured to incoiporate in this work. 
And in order to prevent its being a dry detail of terms and of dates, I have given 
the substance of what has been generally advanced on each subject, and occa- 
sionally selected some of the most interesting pi-actical passages from our best 
and celebrated sermons. I trust, therefore, it will not only be of use to inform the 
mind, but impress the heart ; and thus promote the real good of the reader. The 
critic, however, may be disposed to be severe ; and it will, perhaps, be easy for 
him to observe imperfections. But be this as it may : I can assure him I feel my- 
self happy in the idea that the work is not intended to serve apaity, to encourage 
bigotry, nor .strengthen prejudice, but " for the service of Tinith, by one who 
would be glad to attend and grace her triumphs; as her soldier, if he has had the 
honour to serve successfully under her banner ; or as a captive tied to her cha- 
riot wheels, if he has, though undesignedly, committed any offence against her." 
After all, however, what a learned author said of another work I say of this :•— 
" If it have merit, it will go down to posterity ; if it have none, the sooner it dies 
and is forgot the better " 

CHARLES BUCK. 



THEOLOGICAL DICTIONARY 



A. 



ABB 



ABB 



ABBA, a Syriac word, signifying Fa- 
ther. It is more particularly used 
in the Syriac, Coptic, and Ethiopic 
chu rches, as a title given to the bishops. 
The bishops themselves bestowed the 
titlp Abba more eminently on the bishop 
of Alexandria, which occasioned the 
people to give him the title of Baba or 
Papa; that is, Grandfather: a title 
which he bore before the bishop of 
Rome. It is a Jewish title of honour 
given to certain Rabbins called Tana- 
ites : it is also used by some writers of 
the middle age for the superior of a 
monastery. St. Mark and St. Paul use 
this word in their Greek, Mark xiv. 36. 
Rom. viii. 15. Gal. iv. 6. because it was 
then commonly knoAvn in the syna- 
gogues and the primitive assemblies of 
the Christians. It is thought by Selden, 
Witsius, Doddridge, and others, that 
Saint Paul alluded to a law among the 
Jews which forbade servants or slaves 
to call their master Abba, or Father; 
and that the apostle meant to convey 
the idea that those who believed in 
Christ were no longer slaves to sin ; but 
being brought into a state of holy free- 
dom, might consequently addi'ess God 
as their Father. 

ABBE. The same with Abbot, 
which see. Also the name of curious 
popular characters in France ; who are 
persons who have not yet obtained any 
precise or fixed settlement in church 
oi" state, but most heartily wish for and 
would accept of either, just as it may 
happen. In the mean while their pri- 
vileges are many. In college they are 
the instructors of youth, and in pri- 
vate famihes the tutors of young gen- 
tlemen. 

ABBESS, the supei-ior of an abbey or 
convent of nuns. The abbess has the 
same rights and authority over her nuns 
that the abbots regular have over their 
monks. The sex, indeed, does not al- 
low her to perform the spiritual func- 
tions annexed to the priesthood, where- 
with the abbot is usually invested ; but 
there are instances of some abbesses 
who have a right, or rather a privilege. 



to commission a priest to act for them . 
They have even a kind of episcopal 
jurisdiction, as well as some abbots who 
are exempted from the visitation of 
their diocesan. 

ABBEY, a monastery, governed by a 
superior under the title of Abbot or 
Abbess. Monasteries were at first no- 
thing more than religious houses, whi- 
ther persons retired from the bustle oi 
the woi'ld to spend their time in solitude 
and devotion : but they soon degenerated 
from their original institution, and pro- 
cured large privileges, exemptions, and 
riches. They prevailed greatly in Bri- 
tain before the reformation, particular- 
ly in England; and as they increased in 
riches, so the state became poor, for 
the lands which these i-cgulars possess- 
ed could never revert to the lords who 
gave them. These places were wholly 
abolished by Henry VlII. He first ap- 
pointed visitors to inspect into the liA es 
of the monks and nuns, which were, 
found in some places veiy disorderlv ; 
upon which the abbots, perceiv-ing theii' 
dissolution unavoidable, were induced 
to resign their houses to the king, who 
by that means became invested with the 
abbey lands; these were afterwards 
granted to different persons, whose de- 
scendants enjoy them at this day : they 
were then valued at 2,853,000/. per an- 
num; an immense sum in those days, 
— ^Though the suppression of these 
houses, considered in a religious and 
political light, was a great benefit tii 
the nation, yet it must be owned, that, 
at the time they flourished, they were 
not entirely useless. Abbeys were then 
the repositories as well as the semina- 
ries OI learning: many valuable books 
and national I'ecords have been ])re- 
served in their libraries; the only pla- 
ces wherein they could have been safe- 
ly lodged in those turbulent times. In- 
deed, the historians of this country are 
chiefly beholden to the monks for the 
knowledge they have of former nation- 
al events. Thus a kind Providence 
overruled even the institutions of super- 
stition for good. See Monastery.

ABBOT, the chief ruler of a monas- 
tery or abbey. At first they were lay- 
men, and subject to the bishop and 
ordinary pastors. Their monasteries 
being remote from cities, and built in 
the farthest solitudes, they had no share 
m ecclesiastical affairs ; but, there being 
among them several persons of learning, 
they were called out of their deserts by 
the bishops, and fixed in the suburbs of 
the cities; and at length in the cities 
themselves. From that time they de- 
generated, and, learning to be ambitious, 
aspired to be independent of the bishops, 
■which occasioned some severe laws to 
be made against them. At length, how- 
ever, the abbots carried their point, and 
obtained the title of lord, with other 
badges of the episcopate, particular!}- 
the mitre. Hence arose new distinctions 
among them. Those were termed mitred 
abbotn who were privileged to wear the 
mitre, and exercise episcopal authoi-ity 
within their respective precincts, being 
exempted from the jurisdiction of the 
bishop. Others were called crosiered 
abbots, from their bearing the crosier, 
or pastoral staff. Others were styled 
(Ecumenical or universal abbots, in imi- 
tation of the patriarch of Constantino- 
ple, while others were termed cardinal 
abbots, from their superiority over all 
■other abljots. At present, in the Roman 
catholic countries, tlie chief distinctions 
are those of regular and commendato- 
?T/. The former take the vow and wear 
the habit of their order; whereas the 
latter are seculars, though they are 
obliged by tlieir bulls to take orders 
when of proper age. 

ABELIANS, or Abelonians, a sect 
which arose in the diocese of Hippoo 
in Africa, and is supposed to have oe- 
pin in the reign of Arcadius, and ended 
m that of Theodosius. Indeed, it was 
not calculated for being of any long con- 
tinuance. They regulated marriage af- 
ter the example of Abel, who, they 
pretended, was married, but lived in a 
state of continence: they therefore al- 
lowed each man to many one woman, 
but enjoined them to live in the same 
state. To keep up the sect, when a 
man and woman entered mto this socie- 
ty, they adopted a boy and a girl, who 
•were to inherit their goods, and to mar- 
ry upon the same tei-ms of not having 
children, but of adopting two of differ- 
ent sexes. 

ABESTA, the name of one of the sa- 
cred books of the Persian Magi, which 
they ascribe to their great founder Zo- 
roaster. The Abesta is a commentary 
on two others of their religious books, 
called Ze?id and Fazend j, the three to- 



gether including the whole system of 
the Ignicold, or worshippers of fire. 

ABILITY. See Inability. 

ABLUTION, a ceremony in use 
among the ancients, and still practised 
in several parts of the world. It con- 
sisted in washing the body, which was 
always done betore sacrificing, or even 
entering their houses. Ablutions ap- 
pear to be as old as any ceremonies, 
and external worship itself. Moses en- 
joined them, the heathens adopted them, 
and Mahomet and his followers have 
contmued them. The Egyptians, the 
Greeks, the Romans, the Jews, all had 
them. The ancient Christians had their 
ablutions before communion, which the 
Romish church still retain before their 
mass, and sometimes after. The Sy- 
i-ians, Copts, &amp;c. have their solemn 
washings on Good Friday; the Turks 
also have their ablutions, their Ghast, 
their Wodou, Aman, ficc. 

ABR All AMITES, an order of monks 
exterminated for idolatry by Theophi- 
lus, in the ninth century. Also the name 
of another sect of heretics who had 
adopted the errors of Paulus. See 
Paulicians. 

ABSOLUTION signifies acquittal. 
It is taken also from that act whereby 
the priest declares the sins of such as 
are penitent remitted. The Romanists 
hold absolution a part of the sacrament 
of penance: and the council of Trent and 
that of Florence declare the form or 
essence of the sacrament to lie in the 
words of absolution. "I absolve thee 
" of thy sins." According to this, no one 
can receive absolution without the pri- 
vity, consent and declaration of the 
priest ; except, therefore, the priest be 
willing, God himself cannot pardon any 
man. This is a doctrine as blasphe- 
mous as it is ridiculous. The chief pas- 
sage on which they ground their power 
of absolution is that in John xx. 23: 
" ^'V^losesoe ver sins ye remit, th cy are re- 
mitted unto them, and whosesoever sins 
ye retam, they are retained." But this 
IS not to the purpose ; since this was a 
special commission to the apostles them- 
selves, and the first preachers of the 
Gospel, and most probably referred to 
the power he gave them of discerning 
spirits. By virtue of this power, Peter 
struck Ananias and Sapphira dead, and 
Paul struck Elimas blind. But, sup- 
posing the passage in question to apply 
to the successors of the apostles, and to 
ministers in general, it can only imiiort 
that their office is to preach pardon to 
the penitent, assuring those who believe 
that their sins are forgiven through the 
merits of Jesus Christ j and that those 



ABS 

who remain in unbelief are in a state of 
condemnation. Anj^ idea of authority 
given to fallible, uninspired men to ab- 
solve sinners, different from this, is un- 
scriptural; nor can I see much utility 
in the terms ministerial or declarative 
absolution, as adopted by some divines, 
since absolution is wholly the pi'croga- 
tive of God; and the terms above-men- 
tioned, may, to say the least, have no 
good influence on the minds of the igno- 
rant and superstitious. 

ABSTEMII, a name given to such 
persons as could not partake of the cup 
of the eucharist, on account of then- 
natural aversion to wine. 

ABSTINENCE, in a general sense, 
is the act of refraining from something 
which we have a propension to or find 
])leasure in. It is more particularly 
used tor fasting or forbearing of neces- 
sary food. Among the Jews, various 
kinds of abstinence were ordained by 
their law. Among the primitive Chris- 
tians, some denied themselves the use 
of such meats as were prohibited by that 
law ; others looked upon tliis abstinence 
with contempt ; as to which Paul gives 
his opinion, Kom. xiv. 1. 3. The coun- 
cil of Jerusalem, which v/as held by the 
apostles, enjoined the Christian converts 
to abstain from meats strangled, from 
blood, from fornication, and from idola- 
try. Acts XV. Upon this passage, Dr. 
Doddridge observes, '• that though nei- 
tlier things sacrificed^ to idols, nor the 
flesh of strangled animals, nor blood, 
have or can have any moral evil in 
them, which should make the eating of 
them absolutely and universally unlaw- 
ful; yet they were forbidden to the Gen- 
tile converts, because the Jews had such 
an aversion to them, that they could not 
converse freely with any who used them. 
This is plainly the reason which James 
assigns in the veiy next words, the 21st 
verse, and it is abundantly sufficient. 
This reason is now ceased, and the ob- 
ligation to abstain from eating these 
things ceases with it. But were we in 
like circumstances again, Christian cha- 
rity would surely require us to lay our- 
selves under the same restraint." — The 
spiritual monarchy of the western world 
introduced another sort of abstinence, 
which may be called ritual, and consists 
in abstaining from particular meats at 
certain times and seasons, the iiiles of 
which are called rogations. If I mis- 
take not, the impropriety of this kind 
of abstinence is clearly pointed out in 1 
Tim. iv. 3. — In England, abstinence from 
flesh has been enjoined by statute, even 
since the reformation; particularly on 
Fridays and Saturdays, on vigils, and 



ABY 

on all daj^s commonly called fish days. 
The like injunctions were renewed un- 
der queen Elizabeth; but at the same 
time it was declared, that this was done 
not out of motives of religion, as if there 
were any difference in meats, but in fa- 
vour of the consumption of fish, and to 
multiply the number of fishermen and 
mariners, as well as to spare the stock 
of sheep. See Fastixg. 

ABSTINENTS, a set of heretics that 
appeared in France and Spain about the 
end of the third century. They are sup- 
posed "to have borrowed part of their 
opinions from the Gnostics and Mani- 
cna:ans, because they opposed marriage, 
condemned the use ot flesh meat, and 
placed the Holy Ghost in the class of 
created beings. 

ABYSS, in a general sense, denotes 
something profound ; in its literal sense 
it signifies without a bottom ; in a more 
particular sense it denotes a deep mass 
or fund of waters. In this last sense the 
word is used in the Septuagint for the 
water which God created at the begin- 
ning with the earth, which our transla- 
tors render by deefi. Thus it is that 
darkness is said to have been on the face 
of the abyss. Gen. i. 2. Abijss is also 
used for an immense cavern in the earth, 
wherein God is supposed to have col- 
lected all those waters on the third day, 
which in our version is rendered the 
seas, and elsewhere the great deep. 
Abyss is likewise used to denote the 
grave or common receptacle of the dead, 
Rom. X. 7: also hell, or the bottomless 
I^it, Luke viii. 31. Rev. i:-:. 1. Rev. xi. 7. 
See Deluge. 

ABYSSINIAN CHURCH, that 
which is established in the empire of 
Abyssinia. They are a branch of the 
Copts, with whom they agree in ad- 
mitting only one nature in Jesus Christ, 
and rejecting the council of Chalcedon ; 
whence they are also called Monophy- 
sites and Eutychians, which sec. The 
Abyssinian church is governed by a 
bishop styled abuna. They have ca- 
nons also, and monks. The emperor 
has a kind of supremacy in ecclesiastical 
matters. The Abyssinians have at di- 
vers times expressed an inclination to 
be reconciled to the see of Rome ; but 
rather from interested views than w\y 
other motive. They practise circumci- 
sion on females as well as males. Thej" 
eat no meats prohibited by the law of 
Moses. They observe both Saturda}- 
and Sunday sabbaths. Women are obli- 
ged to the legal purifications. Brothers 
marry bi'others' wives, &amp;c. On the other 
hand, they celebrate the Epiphany with 
peculiar festivity; have four Lents ; pray 



ACA

ACC 



for the dead ; and invoke angels. Ima- 
ges in painting they venerate ; but abhor 
all those in relievo, except the cross. 
They admit the apoci^phal books and 
the canons of the apostles, as well as 
the apostolical constitutions, for genuine. 
They allow of divorce, which is easily 
granted among them, and by the civil 
judge ; nor do their civil laws prohibit 
polygamy. — They have, at least, as 
many miracles and legends of saints as 
the Romish church. They hold that the 
soul of man is not created; because, 
say they, God finished all his works on 
the sixth day. Thus we see that the 
doctrines and ritual of this sect form 
a strange compound of Judaism and 
Christianity, ignorance and superstition. 
Some, indeed, have been at a loss to 
know whether they are most Christians 
«r Jews : it is to be feared, however, that 
there is little beside the name of Chris- 
tianity among them. Should the reader 
be desirous to know more of this sect, he 
may consult Father JLoho's Voyage to 
Abyssinia; Bruce's Travels; Ludoljih's 
Hist, of Ethiopia; and Diet, of Arts and 
Sciences, vol. i. p. 15. 

ACACIANS, a sect of heretics in the 
4th centur}^; so named from Acacius, 
bishop of Cxsarea, who denied tht Son 
to be of the same substance with the 
Father, though some of them allowed 
that he was of a similar substance. Also 
the name of another sect, named after 
Acacius, patriarch of Constantinople, in 
the fifth century, who favoured the opi- 
nions of Eutvchus. See Eutychians. 

ACADEMICS, a denomination given 
to the cultivators of a species of philo- 
sophy originally derived from Socrates, 
and afterwards illustrated and enforced 
by Plato. The contradictory systems 
which had been successively urged upon 
the world were become so numerous, 
that, from a view of the variety and un- 
certainty of human opinions, many were 
led to conclude that truth lay beyond 
the reach of our comprehension. The 
consequence of t]\\s conclusion was ab- 
solute scepticism : hence the existence 
of God, the immortality of the soul, the 
preferableness of virtue to vice, were 
all held as uncertain. This sect, with 
that of the Epicui-eans, were the two 
chief that were in vogue at the time of 
Christ's appearance, and were embra- 
ced and supported by persons of high 
rank and wealth. A consideration of the 
principles of these two r.ects [see Epi- 
cureans] will lead us to form an idea 
of the deplorable state of the world at 
the time of Christ's birth ; and the ne- 
cessity there was of some divine teacher 
to convey to the mind true and certain 



principles of religion and wisdom. Je- 
sus Christ, theretore, is with great pro- 
priety called the Day Spring from on 
High, the Sun of Righteousness, that 
arose upon a benighted world to dispel 
the clouds of ignorance and error, and 
discover to lost man the path of happi- 
ness and heaven. But, as we do not 
mean to enlarge much upon these and 
some other sects, which oelong rather 
to philosophy than theology, we shall 
refer the reader to Buddeus's Intro- 
duction to the History of Philosophy ; 
Stanley's Lives ; Brucker's History of 
Philosophy ; or (which is more modern) 
Eyifield's Abridgment. 

ACCLAMATIONS, ecclesiastical, 
were shouts of joy which the people ex- 
pressed by way of approbation of their 
preachers. It hardly seems credible to 
us that practices of this kind should ever 
have found their way into the church, 
where all ought to be reverence and so- 
lemnity. Yet so it was in the fourth cen- 
tury. The people were not onl)- permit- 
ted, but sometimes even exhorted, by 
the preacher himself, to approve his ta- 
lents by clapping of hands, and loud ac- 
clamations of praise. The usual words 
they made use of were, "Orthodox," 
"Third apostle," &amp;c. These acclama- 
tions being carried to excess, and often 
misplaced, were frequently prohibited 
by the ancient doctors, and at length ab- 
rogated. Even as late, however,"' as the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 
we find practices that were not veiy de- 
corous ; such as loud humming, frequent 
groaning, strange gestures of the body, 
&amp;c. See articles Dancers, Shakers. 

ACCOMMODATION OF SCRIP- 
TURE is the application of it, not to its 
literal meaning, but to something ana- 
logous to it. Thus a prophecy is said to 
be fulfilled properly when a thing fore- 
told comes to pass ; and, by way of ac- 
commodation, when an event happens 
to any place or people similar to what 
fell out some time before to another. 
Thus the words of Isaiah, spoken to 
those of his own time, are said to be ful- 
filled in those who lived in our Saviour's, 
— "Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias pro- 
phesy," occ. : which same words St. Paul 
afterwards accommodates to the Jews 
of his time. Is. xxxix. 14. Matt. xv. 8. 
Acts xiii. 41. Great care, however, 
should be taken by preachers who are 
fond of accommodating texts, that they 
first clearly state the literal sense of the 
passage. 

ACCURSED, something that lies un- 
der a curse or sentence ot excommuni- 
cation. In the Jewish idiom, accursed 
and crucified were synonymous: among 



ACT 

them, ever}' one was accounted accursed i 
who died on a tree. This senes to ex- 
plain the difficult passage in Rom. ix. 2, 
where the apostle wishes himself ac- 
cursed after the manner of Clirist; i. e. 
crucified, if happily he might by such a 
death save his countrymen. The prepo- 
sition auTTo here made use of is used in the 
same sense, 2 Tim. i. 3. where it obvi- 
ously signifies after the maimer of. 

A'CEPHALt, such bishops as were 
exempt from the disci])line and jurisdic- 
tion of their ordinar)' bishop or patri- 
arch. It was also the denomination of 
certain sects; 1. of those who, in the af- 
fair of the council of Ephesus, refused 
to follow either St. Cyril or John of An- 
tioch ; 2. of certain heretics in the fifth 
century, wl ■\ at first, followed Peter 
Mongus, but aftervrards abandoned him, 
upon his subscribing to the council of 
Chalcedon, tliey tliemselves adhering to 
the Eulychian heresy ; and, 3. of the fol- 
lowers of Severus of Antioch, and of all, 
in general, who held out against the 
coimcil of Chalcedon. 

ACOEMET/E, or Acomkti, an or- 
der of monks at Constai^tinople in the 
fifth century, whom the writers of that 
and the following ages called hifAyfrM ; 
that is. Watchers, because they per- 
formed divine service day and night 
without intermission. They divided 
themselves into three classes, who al- 
ternately succeeded one another, so that 
they kept up a peipetual course of woi-- 
ship. This practice they founded upon 
that passage — "pray without ceasing," 
1 Thess. v! 17. 

ACOLYTHI, or Acoluthi, young 
people who, in the primitive times, as- 
pired to tlie ministry, and for that pur- 
pose continually attended tlie bishop. 
In the Romish church, Acolythi were of 
longer continuance ; but their functions 
were different from those of their first 
institution. Their business was to light 
the tapers, carry the candlesticks and 
the incense pot, and prepare tlie wine 
and water. At Rome there were three 
kinds; 1. those who waited on the pope; 

2. those who served in the churches ; 

3. and others, who, together with the 
deacons, oliiciated in otlier pails of the 
city. 

ACT OF FAITH {Auto da Fe,) in 
the Romish church, is a solemn day held 
by the Inquisition for the punishment of 
heretics, and the absolution of the inno- 
cent accused. They usually contrive the 
Auto to fall on some great festival, that 
the execution may pass with the more 
awe ; and it is always on a Sunday. The 
Auto da Fe may be called the last act 
of the Inquisitorial tragedy : it is a kind 



ACT 

of gaol-deliven-, appointed as often as a 
competent number of prisoners in the 
Inquisition are convicted of heresy, ei- 
ther by their own voluntary or extorted 
confession, or on the evidence of certain 
witnesses. The process is this : — In the, 
moi-ning they are brought into a great 
hall, where they have certain habits 
put on, which they are to wear in the 
procession, and by which they know 
their doom. The procession is led up 
by Dominican friars, after which come 
the penitents, being all in black coats 
without sleeves, and barefooted, with a 
wax candle in their hands. These ai'e 
followed by the penitents who have nar- 
•ruv/lv escaped being burnt, who over 
their black coats have flames painted, 
with their p'oints turned downwards. 
Next come the negative and relapsed, 
who are to be burnt, having flames on 
their habits pointing upwards. After 
these come such as profess doctrines 
contrary to the faith of Rome, who, 
besides' flames pointing upwards, have 
their picture painted on their breasts, 
^vith dogs, serpents, and devils, all open- 
moutlied, about it. Each prisoner is at- 
tended with a familiar of the Inquisition ; 
and those to be burnt have also a Jesuit 
on each hand, who are continually 
preaching to them to abjure. After the 
prisoners, comes a troop of familiars on 
IiorsebaGk ; and after them the Inquisi- 
tors, and other officers of the court, on 
mules: last of all, the Inquisitor-general 
on a white horse, led by two men with, 
black hats and green hat-bands. A 
scatlbld is erected big enough for two or 
three thousand people ; at one end of 
which are the prisoners, at the other the 
Inquisitors. After a sermon made up of 
encomiums of the Inquisition, and in- 
vectives against heretics, a priest as- 
cends a desk near the scaffold, and, hav- 
ing taken the abjuration of the penitents, 
recites the final sentence of those who 
are to be put to death, and delivers them. 
to the secular arm, earnestly beseech- 
ing at the same time the secular power 
7iot to touch their blood, or put their 
lives in daneer! ! ! The prisoners, be- 
ing thus in the hands of the civil magis- 
trate, are presently loaded with chains, 
and carried first to the secular gaol, and 
from thence, in an hour or two, brought 
before the civil judge ; who, after ask- 
ing in what religion they intend to die, 
pronounces sentence on such as de- 
clare they die in the communion of the 
church of Rome, that they shall be first 
strangled, and then burnt to ashes; 
or such as die in any other faith, that 
they be burnt alive. Both are imme- 
diatelv carried to the Ribera, the place 



ACT 



of execution, -where there are a&gt; many 
stakes set up as there are prisoners to 
be burnt, witli a quantity of dry furze 
about them . The stakes of the profess- 
ed, that is, such as persist in the heresy, 
are about four yards high, having a 
small board towards the top for the 
prisoner to be seated on. The negati\'e 
and relapsed being first strangled and 
burnt, the professed mount then- stakes 
by a ladder, and the Jesuits, after seve- 
ral repeated exhortations to be recon- 
ciled to the church, part with them; 
telling them that they leave them to 
the devil, who is standing at their elboAV, 
to receive their souls, and carry them 
w-ith him to the flames of hell. On tlws 
u gi'eat shout is ra'.sed ; and the cry is, 
'^Let the dogs' beards be viade .'" which 
is done by thrusting flaming furzes fast- 
ened to long poles against their faces, 
till their faces are burnt to a coal, which 
is accompanied with the loudest accla- 
mations of joy. At last, fire is set to 
the furze at the bottom of the stake, 
over which the professed are chained so 
liigh, that the top of the flame seldom 
reaches higher than the seat they sit on ; 
so that they rather seem roasted than 
bunit. There cannot be a more lament- 
able spectacle : the sufferers continually 
cry nut, while they are able, " Pit)-, for 
the love of God!" Yet it is beheld, by 
all sexes and ages, with transports of 
joy and satisfaction — O merciful (icd ! 
is this the benign, humane religion thou 
hast given to men ? Surely not. If such 
were the genius of Chi-istiani(.r,then it 
would be no honour to be a Christian. 
Let us however, rejoice that the time 
is coming when the demon of Persecu- 
tion shaU be banished out of this our 
world, and the time spirit of benevolence 
and candovu' pervade the universe; 
when none shall huit or destroy, but 
the earth be filled with the knowledge 
gf the Lord, as the waters cover the 
sea! See Inquisition.

ACTS OF THE APOSTLES, one 
of the sacred books of the New Testa- 
ment containing the history of the infant 
church during the space of twenty-nine 
or thirty years from the ascension of 
our Lord to the year of Christ 63. It 
was written bv Luke, and addressed to 
Theophilus, *X\e person to whom the 
evangelist had before dedicated his gos- 
pel. The style of this work, which was 
originally composed in Greek, is much 
purer tlian that of the other canonical 
writers. For the contents of this book 
we refer the reader to the book itself. 
There liave been several act^of the 



lO ADM 

apostlr:;, snch as the acts of Abdias, of 
Peter, of Paul, St. John the Evangelist, 
St. Andrew, St. Thomas, St. Philip, and 
St. Matthias; but they have been all 
proved to be spurious. 

ACTS OF PILATE, a relation sent 
by Pilate to the Emperor Tiberius, con- 
cerning Jesus Christ, his death, resur- 
rection, ascension, and the crimes of 
which he was convicted before him. It 
was a custom among the Romans, that 
the pro-consuls and governors of pi'o- 
^'inces should draw up acts or memoirs 
of what happened in the course of their 
government, and send them to the em- 
peror and senate. The genuine act* 
of Pilate were sent by him to Tiberius, 
who reported them to the senate ; but 
they were rejected by that assembh% 
because not immediately addressed to 
them; as is testified by Tertullian, in 
his Apol. cap. 5, and 20, 21. The here- 
tics forged acts in imitation of them ; 
but both the genuine and the spurious 
are no^v lost. 

ADAMITES, a sect that sprang up 
in the second century. Epiphanius tells 
us, that they were called Adamites, from 
their pretending to be re-established in 
the state of innocence, such as Adam 
was at the moment of his creation, 
whence tliey ought to imitate him in 
going naked. They detested marriage ; 
maintaining that the conjugal union 
would ne^er have taken place upon 
earth, had sin been unknown. This ob- 
scure and ridiculous sect did not last 
long. It was, however, revived v/ith ad- 
ditional absurdities in the twelfth cen- 
tury. About the beginning of the fif- 
teeiith centuiy, these errors spread in 
Germany and Bohemia: it found also 
some partisans in Poland, Holland, and 
England. They assembled in the night ; 
and it is said." one of the fundamental 
maxims of their society was contained 
in the following verse : 

Jura, perjure, secretuni prodere noli. 

Swear, forswear, and reveal not the secret. 

ADESSENARIANS, a branch of the 
Sacramcntarians; so called from the 
Latin Adesse, to be present, because 
they believed the presence of Christ'.s 
body in the eucharist, though in a man- 
ner "different from the Romanists. 

ADIAPHORISTS, a name given in 
the sixteenth century to the moderate 
Lutherans who adhered to the senti- 
ments of Melancthon; and aftei-wards 
, to those who subscribed the interim of 
i Charles V. [See Interim.] The word 
j is of Greek origin (a/wcpsgjf) and signi- 
fies indifference or lukewarmness. 

ADMIRATION is that passion of 
the mind which is excited by the dis-

ADO 



covciy of any great excellence in an 
object. It has by some •writers been 
used as synonymous with surprise and 
wonder ; out it is evident they are not 
the same. Surprise refcis to something 
unexpected ; wonder, to something great 
or strange ; but admiration includes the 
idea of high esteem or resjjcct. Thus, 
we say we admire a man's excellen- 
cies, but we do not say tliat we are sur- 
prised at them, W^c wonder at an ex- 
traordinar)^ object or event, but we do 
not always admire it. 

ADMONITION denotes a hint or 
advice given to another, whereby we 
reprove him for his fiuilt, or remind him 
of his duty. Admonition was a part of 
the discipline much used in the ancient 
church : it was the first act or step to- 
wards the punishment or exjjulsion of 
delinquents. In case of pri\'ate offences, 
it was perfoi-med accorciing to the evan- 
gelical vmXc, privately ; incase of public 
oifence, openly befoie the church. If 
either of these sufficed for the recovery 
of the fallen person, all further pro- 
ceedings, in a way of censure, ceased ; 
if they did not, recoui-se v/as had to ex- 
tiommunication. — ^Tit. iii. 10. 1 Thess. v. 
14. Eph. vi. 4. 

ADONAI, one of the names of the 
Supreme Being in the Scriptiu-es. The 
proper meaning of the word is " my 
i,onls," in tlie plural number; ss^dorri 
is ?ny Lord, in tbe singular. The Jews, 
who either out of respect or superstition 
do not pronounce the name of Jehovah, 
read Adonai in tlie room of it, as often 
as they meet with Jehovah in the He- 
brew text. But the aticient Jews were 
not so scrupulous ; nor is there any law 
which forbids them to pronounce the 
name of God. 

ADONISTS, a party among divines 
and critics, who maintain that the He- 
brew points ordinarily annexed to the 
consonants of the word Jehovah are not 
the natural points belonging to that 
word, nor express the tine pronvmcia- 
tion of it ; but are the vowel points be- 
longing to the words Adonai and Elo- 
him, applied to the consonants of the 
ineffable name Jehovah, to warn the 
readers, that instead of the word Jelio- 
rah, which the Jews were forbid to pro- 
nounce, and the tnie pronunciation of 
which had long been unknown to them, 
they are always to read Adonai. They 
are opposed to Jehovists, of whom the 
principal are Drusius, Capellus, Bux- 
torf, Alting, and Reland. 

ADOPTIONISTS, the follov/ei-s of 
Felix of Urgil and Epiland of Toledo, 
who, towards the end of the eighth cen- 
tury, advanced the notion that Jesus 



; Christ in his human nature is the Son of 
: God, not b\^ nature, but by adoption. 
I ADOPTION, an act whereby any 
' person receives another into his family, 
I owns him for his son, and appoints him 
his heir. 2. Spiriiual adoption is an act 
j; of Grod's free grace, whereby we are 
! received into the number, and have a 
! right to all the privileges of the sons of 
I God. — 3. Glorious, is that in vdiicli the 
I saints, being raised from the dead, are 
1 at the last dax' solemnly owned to be the 
j children of God, and enter into the full 
possession of that inheritance provided 
I for them, Rom. viii. 19. 23- Adoption is 
I a v/ord taken from the civil law, and 
j was much in use among the Romans in 
the apostles' time ; when it was a cus- 
tom for persons who had no children oi 
I their own, and were possessed of an 
I estate, to prevent its being divided, or 
' descending to strangers, to make choice 
of such who were agreeable to them, 
and beloved by them, Avhom they took 
into this political relation of children ; 
obliging them to talie their name upon 
them, and to pay respect to them as 
though they were tlieir natural parent-:, 
and engaging to deal with them as though 
they had been so ; and accordingly to 
give them a right to their estates, as an 
inheritance. This new relation, founded 
in a mutual consent, is a bond of affec- 
tion ; and the privilege arising from 
thence is, that he vi^lio is in this sens^^ a 
father, takes care of and provides fgr 
the person whom he adopts, as though 
he were his sen by nature ; and there -&gt; 
fore civilians call it an act of legitima- 
tion, imitating nature, or supplying the 
place of it. 

It is easy, then, to conceive the pro- 
priety of the term as used by the apos- 
tle in reference to this act, thougli it 
must be confessed there is some differ- 
ence between civil and spiritual adop- 
tion. Civil adoption was allowed of and 
provided for the relief and comfort of 
those who had no childi"en ; but in spi- 
ritual adoption this reason does not ap- 
pear. The Almighty was under no 
obligation to do this ; for he had innu- 
merable spirits whom he had created, 
besides his own Son, who had all the 
perfections of the divine nature, who 
was the object of his delight, and who 
is styled the heir of all things, Heb. i. 3. 
WTien men adopt, it is on account of 
some excellency in the persons who 
are adopted ; thus Pharaoh's daughter 
adopted Moses because he was exceed- 
ing fair, Acts vii. 20, 21 ; and Mordecai 
adopted Esther because she v/as his 
uncle's daughter, and exceeding fair,

adoption makes us relatively his 
sons, by conveying a power, John i. 12. 
By the one we are instated in the di- 
vine affection ; by the other we are par- 
takers of the divine nature." 

The privileges of adoption are every 
ivay great and extensive. 1. It implies 
great honour. They have God's name 
put upon them, and are described as 
"his people, called by his name," 2 
Chron. vii. 24. Eph. xvi. 15. Tliey are 
no longer slaves to sin and the world ; 
but, emancipated from its dreadful bon- 
dage, are raised to dignity and honour.

we shall be : but we know that when he

we shall see him as he is," 1 John iii. 2.

} children at home, where we shall al- 

[ ways behold the face of our heavenly 

j Father, for ever celebrating his praises, 

i admiring his perfections, and enjoying 

\ his presence. " So shall we be ever

The evidences of adoption are, 1. 
\ Re7iunciation of all former dependen- 
cies. When a child is" adopted, he relin- 
quishes the object of his past confidence, 
and submits hnnself to the will and plea-

" Other lords have had dominion over 
us; but by thee only will we make

Matt. xfii. 45, 46. Phil. iii. 8.-2. Affec- 
tion. This may not always apply to 
civil adoption, but it always does to spi- 
ritual. The childi-en of God feel a re- 
eard for him above eveiy other object. 
His own excellency, his unspeakable 

foodness to them, his promises of future 
lessings, are all grounds of the strongest 
love. "Whom have I in heaven but 
thee ? and there is none upon earth that 
I desire besides thee." Psalm Ixxiii. 25. 
" Thou art my portion, saith my soul, 
therefore will I hope in thee." Lam. iii. 
24. Luke vii. 47. Ps. xviii. 1. — 3. Access 
to God ivith a holy boldness. They who 
are children by adoption are supposed 
to have the same libei'ty of access as 
those who are children by nature ; so 
those who are partakers of the blessings 
of spiritual adoption will prove it by a 
reverential, yet familiar address to the 
Father of spirits: they will confess their 
unworthiness, acknowledge their de- 
pendence, and implore the mercy and 
favour of God. "Because ye are sons, 
God hath sent forth the Spirit of his 
Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Fa- 
ther." Gal. iv. 6. "Through Jesus 
Christ we have access by one Spirit 
unto the Father." Eph. ii. 18. Having 
such a privilege, they " come boldly to 
the throne of grace, that they may obtain 
mercv and find grace to help in time of 
need.'' Heb.iv. 16. — 4. Obedience. Those 
who are adopted into a family must 
obey the laws of that family ; so be- 
lievers prove themselves adopted by 
their obedience to the word and ordi- 
nances of God. "Ye are my friends, 
if ye do whatsoever I command you." 
John XV. 14. "Whoso keepeth his 
word, in him verily is the love of God 
perfected : hereby know we that wc are 
m him. He that saith he abideth in 
him, ought himself also to walk even as 
he walked." 1 John ii. 4, 5. — 5. Patient 

fet joyful expectation of the inheritance, 
n civu adoption, indeed, an inheritance 
is not always certain ; but in spiritual 
adoption it is. " To them who, by pa- 
tient continuance in well doing, seek for 
glory, and honour, and immortality, 
eternal life." Rom. ii. 7. "We look 
not at the things which are seen, but at 
the things which are not seen ; for the 
things which are seen are temporal, but 
the things which are not seen are eter- 
nal." 2 Cor. iv. 18. Rom. vi. 23. Heb. 
xi. 26, 27. From the consideration of 
the whole of this doctrine, we may learn 
that adoption is an act of free grace 



through Jesus Christ. Eph. i. 5. Ap-

ADORATION, the act of rendering 
divine honours, including m it i-everence, 
esteem, and love: this is called supreme, 
or absolute. The word is compounded, 
of ad, " to," and os, oris, " mouth ;" and 
literally signifies to apply the hand to 
the mouth, "to kiss the hand;" this 
being in the eastern countries, one of 
the great marks of respect and submis- 
sion. See Job xxxi. 26, 27. The atti- 
tude of adoration, however, we find hae 
not been confined to this mode ; stand- 
ing, kneeling, uncovering the head, 
prostration, bowing, lifting up the eyes 
to heaven, or sometimes fixing thens 
upon the earth with the body bending 
forward; sitting with the under parts of 
the thighs resting on the heels, have all 
been used, as expressive of veneration 
and esteem. Whatever be the form, 
however, it must be remembered, that 
adoration, as an act of worship, is due to 
God alone. Matt. iv. 10. Acts x. 25, 26. 
Rev. xix. 10. There is, 2. what may be 
called adoration human, or paying ho- 
mage or respect to persons of^gTeat rank 
and dignity. This has been performed 
by bowing, bending the knee, falling on 
the face. The practice of adoration 
may be said to be still subsisting in 
England, in the ceremony of kissing the 
king's or queen's hand, and in seiwing 
them at table, both being performed 
kneeling on one knee. There is also, 
3. adoration relative, which consists in 
worship paid to an object as belonging 
to or representative of^ another. In this 
sense the Romanists profess to adore the 
cross not simply or immediately, but in 
respect of Jesus Christ, whom they sup- 

Eose to be on it. This is generally, 
owever, considered by protestants, as 
coming little short of idolatry. See 
Idolatry. 

ADVERSARY, one who sets himself 
in opposition to another: one of the 
names of Satan. See Satan. 

ADVERSITY, a state which is op- 
posite to our wishes, and the cause of 
sorrow. It stands opposed to prosperi- 
ty. See Affliction.

hctwecn one married person and ano- 
ther, or between a married and an un- 
married person. — 2. It is also used in 
Scripture for idolatry, or departing from 
the true God. Jer. lii. 9. — 3. Also for 
any species of impurity or crime against 
the virtue of chastity. Matt. v. 28. — 4. 
It is also used in ecclesiastical writers 
for a person's invading or intruding into 
a bishop rick during the former bishop's 
life. — 5. The word is also used in an- 
cient customs for the punishment or 
fine imposed for that offence, or the 
privilege of prosecuting for it. — Al- 
though adultery is prohibited by the law 
of God, yet some have endeavoured to 
explain away the moral turpitude of it ; 
but it is evident, observes Paley, that, 
on the part of the man who solicits the 
chastity of a married woman, it certain- 
ly includes the crime of seduction, and 
is attended with mischief still more ex- 
tensive and complicated; it creates a 
iiew sufferer, the injured husband, upon 
"whose affection is inflicted a wound the 
most painful and incurable that human 
nature knovv's. The infidelity of the 
ivomaii is aggra\'ated by cruelty to her 
children, who are generally involved in 
their parents' shame, and always made 
unhappy by their quarrel. The mar- 
riage vow is witnessed before God, and 
accompanied with circumstances of so- 
lemnity and religion, Avhich approach 
to the nature of an oath. The married 
offender, therefore, incurs a crime little 
short of perjur3% and the seduction of a 
married woman is little less than sub- 
ornation of perjury. But the strongest 
apology for adultery is, the prior trans- 
gression of the other party ; and so far, 
indeed, as the bad effects of adulter\" are 
anticipated by the conduct of the hus- 
band or wife who offends first, the guilt of 
the second offender is extenuated. But 
this can never amount to a justification, 
unless it could be shown that the obli- 
gation of the marriage voav depends 
upon the condition of reciprocal fidelity ; 
a consti-uction v/hich appears founded 
neither in expediency, nor in terms of 
the vow, nor in the design of the legis- 
lature, which prescribed the marriage 
rite. To consider the offence upon the 
footing oi provocation, therefore, can by 
no means vindicate retaliation. " Thou 
shalt not commit adultery," it must ever 
be remembered, was an interdict de- 
livered bv God himself. Tiiis crime has 
been punished in almost all ages and na- 
tions. By the Jewi.sh law it was pmiished 
■with death in both parties, where either 
the woman was married, or both. Among 
the Egyptian j^ adultery in the man was 
punished by a thousand lashes with rods, 



and in the woman by the loss of her nose. 
The Greeks put out the eyes of the 
adulterers. Among the Romans, it was 
punished by banishment, cuttmg off the 
ears, noses, and by sewing the adulterers 
into sacks, and throwing them into the 
sea, scoui'ging, burning, &amp;c. In Spain 
and Poland they were almost as severe. 
The Saxons formerly burnt the adul- 
teress, and over her ashes erected a 
gibbet, Avhereon the adulterer was hang- 
I ed. King Edmund in this kingdom, or- 
; dered adultery to be punished in the 
j same manner as homicide. Canute or- 
j dered the man to be banished, and the 
! woman to haA e her nose and eai's cut off, 
i Modern punishments, in different na- 
[ tions, do not seem to be so severe. In 
I Britain it is reckoned a spiritual offence, 
I and is cognizable by the sj&gt;iritual courts, 
I where it is punished by fine and pe- 
nance. See Paicy^'i Moral and Political 
Philosop/nj, p. 309j vol. i. 12th edition. 

AERIANS, a branch of Arians hi the 
reign of Constantine, who held that there 
was no difference between bishops and 
priests; a doctrine maintained by many 
modern divines, particularly of the pres- 
bytei'ian and retormed churches. The 
sect received its denomination from 
Aerius, who founded his doctrine on 1 
Tim. iv. 14. Sec Episcopacy. 

AETIANS, those who maintained 
that the Son and Holy Ghost were in all 
things dissimilar to the Father. Thev 
received their name from Aetius, one of 
the most zealous defenders of Arianism, 
who was born in Syria, and flourished 
about the year 336. Besides the opinions 
which the Aetians held in common with 
the Arians, they maintained that faith 
without works was sufficient to salva- 
tion ; and that no sin howe\er grie\'ous, 
would be imputed to the faithful. Ae- 
tius, moreo-ver, affirmed that what God 
had concealed from the apostles, he had 
revealed to him. 

AFFECTION, in a phUosophical 
sense, refers to the manner in which we 
are affected by any thing for a continu- 
ance, whether painful or j)leasant : but 
in the most common sense, it may be 
defined to be a settled bent of mind to- 
wards a particular being or thing. It 
holds a middle place between dis/iosi- 
tion on the one hand, and passion on 
the other. It is distinguishable from dis- 
position, which being a branch of one's 
nature originally, must exist before there 
can be an opportunity to exert it upon 
any jiaiticular object; whereas affection 
can never be original, because having 
a special relation to a particular ob- 
ject, it cannot exist till the object have 
once, at least, been presented. It is also 



AFF 



15

distinguishable from passion, which, de- 
pending on tlie real or ideal presence 
of its object, vanishes with its object; 
whereas affection is a lasting connexion, 
and, like other connexions, subsists, 
even when we do not think of t)ie ob- 
jects. [SeeDisPOSiTioN and.PASsiON.] 
The affections, as they respect religion, 
deserve in this place a little attention. 
They may be dehned to be the " vigo- 
rous and sensible exercises of the incli- 
nation and will of the soul towards reli- 
gious objects." Whatever extremes 
itoics or enthusiasts have run into, it is 
evident that the exercise of the affec- 
tions is essential to the existence of true 
religion. It is true, indeed, " that all af- 
fectionate devotion is not wise and ra- 
tional; but it is no less true, that all wise 
iiud I'ational devotion must be affection- 
ate." The affections are the springs of 
action ; they belong to oui- riature, so th;it 
with the highest perceptions of tnitii 
and religion, we shoidd be inacti\ e with- 
out them. They have considerable in- 
fluence on men in the common concerns 
of life ; how much more, then, should 
they operate in those impoitant objects 
that relate to the Divine Being, the im- 
mortality of the soul, and the happiness 
or miseiT of a future state ! The reli- 
gion of the most eminent saints has al- 
ways consisted in the exercise of holv 
affections. Jesiis Ch.rist himself aflbrds 
us an example of the most lively and 
\ igorous affections ; and we have eveiy 
j-eason to believe that the employment 
of heaven consists in the exercise of 
them. In addition to all which the scrip- 
tures of truth teach us, th.at religion is 
nothing, if it occupy not the aflections. 
Deut. vi. 4, 5. Deut. xxx. 6. Rom. xii. 
11. 1 Cor. xiii. 13. Ps. xxvii. 14. 

A distinction however, must be made 
between what may be raerehi yiatural, 
and what is truly spiritual. The affec- 
tions may be excited in a natural way 
under ordinances by a natural impres- 
sion, Ezek. xxxiii. 32 ; by a natural sym- 
pathy, ov by the natural temperament of 
our constitution. It is no sign that our 
affections are spiritual because they are 
raised very high ; produce great effects 
on the body ; excite us to be very zeal- 
ous in externals ; to be alwavs convers- 
ing about ourselves, &amp;c. These things are 
often found in those who are onlymere 
professors of religion. Matt. vii. 21, 22. 

Now, in order to ascertain whether 
our affections are excited in a spiritual 
manner, we must enquire whether that 
which moves our affections be truly 
spiritual, whether our consciences be 
alarmed, and our hearts impressed; 
whether the judgment be enlightened. 



and we have a perception of the moral 
excellency of divine things; and lastly, 
whether our affections have a holy ten- 
dency and produce the happy effects of 
obedience to God, humility m ourselves, 
and justice to our fellow creatures. As 
this is a subject worthy of close atten- 
tion, the reader may consult Lord

AFFLICTION, that which causes a 
sensation of pain. Calamity or distress 
of any kind, i he afflictions of the saints 
are represented in the scripture, as api- 
jiointed, 1 Thes. iii. 3. Job v. 6, 7 ; nu- 
me}-ous,¥s. xxxiv. 19; tra?2sient, 2 Cor. 
iv. 17. Heb. x. 57 ; and, when sanctified, 
beneficial, 1 Pet. i. 6. Ps. cxix. 67, 71. 
They Avcan from the world; work sub- 
mission ; produce humility ; excite to 
diligence ; stir up to prayer ; and conform 
us to the divine image. To bear them: 
with patience, we should consider our 
own unworthiness ; the design of God 
in sending them; the promises of support 
under them ; and the real good they are 
productive of. The afflictions of a good 
man, says an elegant writer, never befal 
without a cause, nor are sent but upon a 
proper errand. These storms are never 
allowed to rise but in order to dispel 
some noxious vapours, and restore salu- 
brity to the moral atmosphere. Who 
that for the first time beheld the earth 
in the midst of winter, bound up with 
frost, or drenched in floods of rain, or 
covered with .snow, would have imaghi- 
ed that Nature, in this dreary and torpid 
state, was working towards its o\n\ re- 
novation in the spring ? Yet we by expe- 
rience know that those vicissitudes of 
winter are necessaiy for fertilizing the 
earth ; and that under wintry rains and 
snows lie concealed the seeds of those 
roses that are to blossom in the spring ; 
of those fruits that are to ripen m the 
summer; and of the corn and wine 
which are in harvest to make glad the 
heart of man. It would be more agree- 
able to us to be always entertained with 
a fair and clear atmosphere, with cloud- 
less skies, and pei-petual sunsliine ; yet 
in such climates as we have most know- 
ledge of, the earth, were it r.lways to 
remain in such a state, would refuse to 
yield its fruits; and, in the midst of our 
Imagined scenes of beauty, the starved 
inhabitants would perish for want oi 
food. Let us, therefore, quietly submit 
to Providence. Let us conceive this life 
to be the winter of our existeHce. Now

AGAPiE, or Love Feasts (from 
«ya5r«, "love,") feasts of charity among 
the ancient christians, when liberal con- 
tributions were made by the rich to the 
poor. St. Chrysostom gives the follow- 
Hig account of this feast, which he de- 
rives from the apostolic practice. I;ie 
says, "The first Christians had all things 
in common, as we read in the Acts of 
the apostles ; but when that equality of 
possessions ceased, as it did even in the 
apostles' time, the Agape or love feast 
was substituted in the room of it. Upon 
certain daj'S, after partaking of the 
Lord's supper, they met at a common 
feast ; the rich bringing provisions, and 
the poor, who had nothing, being invi- 
ted. It was always atteixled with rc- 
eeixing the holy sacrament ; but there 
is some difference between the ancient 
and modern interpreters, as to the cir- 
cumstance of time ; viz. whether this 
feast was held before or after the com- 
munion. St. Chr}'sostom is of the latter 
opinion ; the learned Dr. Cave of the 
former. These love feasts, during the 
first three centuries, were held in the 
church without scandal or offence ; but 
in after-times the heathens began to tax 
them with impurity. This gave occa- 
sion to a reformation of the^e Agapes. 
The kiss of charity, with which the ce- 
remony used to end, was no longer given 
between different sexes; and it was ex- 
pressly forbidden to have any beds or 
couches for the conveniency of those 
who should be disposed to eat more at 
their ease. Notwithstanding these pre- 
cautions, the abuses committed in them 
became so notorious, that the holding 
them (in churches at least) was solemn- 
ly condemned at tlie council of C'ar- 
thage, in the year 397. Attempts have 
been made of late years, to revive these 
feasts ; but in a different manner from 
the primitive custom, and, perhaps, with 
little edification. They are, however, 
not very general. 

AGAPETiE, a name given to cer- 
tain virgins and widows, who in the an- 
cient church associated tliemselves with 
and attended on ecclesiastics, out of a 
motive of piety and charity. See Dea- 
conesses. 

AGENDA, among divmes and phi- 
losophers, signifies the duties which a 



man lies under an obligation to perform : 
thus we meet with the agenda of a chris- 
tian, or the duties he ought to perform, 
in opposition to the credenda, or the 
things he is to believe. It is also applied 
to the sen ice or office of the church, 
and to church books compiled by public 
authority, prescribing the order to be 
observed ; and amounts to the same as 
ritual, formularv, directory, missal, Sec. 

AGENT, that which acts : opposed 
io patient, or that which is acted upon. 

AGENTS, moral. See Moral 
Agent. 

ACiNOETiE, (from a&gt;vc&amp;. "to be ig- 
norant of,") a sect which appeared about 
370. They called in question the omni- 
science of God ; alleging that he knew 
things past only by memoiy, and things 
future only by an uncertain prescience. 
There arose another sect ot the same 
name in the sixth century, who follow- 
ed Themistius, deacon of Alexandria. 
They maintained that Christ was igno- 
rant "of certain things, and particularly 
of the time of the day of judgment. It is 
supposed thev built their hypothesis on 
that passage in Mark xiii. 32. — "Of that 
day and that hour knoweth no man ; no, 
not the angels whicli are in heaven, nei- 
ther the Son, but the Father." The 
meaning of which, most probably, is, 
that this was not kno^vn to the Messiah 
himself in his human nature, or by vii'- 
tue of his unction, as any part of the 
mysteries he was to reveal ; for, consi- 
dering him as God, he could not be ig- 
norant of anv thing. 

AGNUSDEI, in the church of Rome, 
a cake of wax, stamped with the figure 
of a lamb supporting the banner of the 
cross. The name literally signifies 
"I^amb of God." Those cakes being 
consecrated by the pope with gi-eat so- 
lemnity, and distributed among the peo- 
ple, are supposed to have great virtues 
Thev cover them with a piece of stuff 
cut in the form of a heart, and can-y 
them very devoutly in their processions. 
The Roniish priests and I'eligious derive 
considerable pecuniary advantage from 
! selling them to some, and pi-esenting 
them to others. 

AGONTSTICI, a name given by Do- 
natus to such of his disciples as he sent 
to fairs, markets, and other publicpla- 
ces, to propagate his doctrine. They 
were called Agonistici from the Greek 
ttyo^v, "combat," because they were sent, 
as it were, to fight and subdue the peo- 
ple to their opinions. See Donatist. 

AGONYCLIT^, a sect of Chris- 
tians in the seventh century, whopraj'- 
I ed always standing, as thinking it un- 
" lawful to kneel.

AG'ilS'IANJ, a sect which appeared 
about 694. The)' condemned all use of 
flesli and marriage as not instituted by 
(iod, but introduced at the instigation of 
the devil. 

AL ASC ANI, a sect of Anti-lvitherans 
in the sixteenth century, whose distin- 
guished tenet, besides their denying bap- 
tism, is said to have Ijeen this, that the 
words, "Tliis is my body," in the insti- 
tution of the eucharist, are not to be un- 
derstood of tiie bread, but of the whole 
action or celebration of the supper. 

ALBANENSES, a denomination 
which commenced about th.e year 796. 
'I'hey held with the Cinostics and Mani- 
cheans, two principles, the one of good 
and the other of evil. They denied the 
divinity, and even the humanity of .Tesus 
Christ, asserting tliat he was not truly 
man, did not suffer on the cross, die. rise 
again, nor really ascend into hea\'en. 
They rejected the doctrine of the resui-- 
rection, affirmed that the general judg- 
ment was past, and that hell torments 
were no other than the evils we feel and 
suffer in this life. They denied free will, 
did not admit original sin, and never 
administered baptism to infants. They 
held that a man can give the Holv Spi- 
rit of himself, and that it is unlawful tor 
a Christian to take an oath. 

This denomination derived their name 
from the i)lace where their spiritual 
ruler resided. See Manicheans and 
Catherist. 

ALBANOIS, a denomination which 
sprang up in the eighth century, and re- 
newed the greatest part of the Mani- 
chean principles. They also maintained 
tliat t^ie world was from eternity. See 
Manicheans. 

ACBIGENSES, a party of reform- 
ers about Toulouse and the Albigeois in 
Languedoc, who sprung up in the twelfth 
century, and distmguishecl themselves 
by their opposition to the church of 
Rome. They were charged with many 
eiTors by the monks of those days ; Ijut 
from these charges they are generally 
acquitted by the Protestants, who con- 
sider them onl)' as the inventions of the 
Romish ch\irch to Ijlacken their charac- 
ter. The Albigenses grew so formida- 
ble, that the Catholics agreed upon a 
holy league or cruf^ade against them. 
Pope Innocent III. desirous to put a stop 
to their progress, stin-ed up the great 
men of the kingdom to make war upon 
them. After suffering from their per- 
secutors, they dwindled by little and lit- 
tle, till the time of the refoiination; 
when such of them as were left, fell in 
with the ^■'audois, and conformed to the 
flortrine of Zuinglius. and the discijiles 



of Geneva. The Albigenses have been 
frequently confounded with the Wal- 
denses ; from whom it is said they differ 
in many respects, botli as being prior to 
them in point of time, as having their 
origin in a different country, and as being 
charged with di\'ers heresies, particu- 
larly iVIanicheism, from which the Wal- 
denses were exempt. See Walden- 

" ALEXANDRIAN MANUSCRIPT, 

a famous copy of the Scriptures, in foui- 
i volumes quarto. It contains the whole 
j bible in Greek, including tlie Old and 
i New Testament, with the Apocrypha, 
and some smaller pieces, but not quite- 
! complete. It is preser^■ed in the Bri- 
tish Museum : it was sent as a present tu 
king Chai'lcs I. from Cyrilhis Lucaris. 
patriarch of Constantinople, by Sii' 
Thomas Rowe, aml^assador from Eng- 
land to the grand Seignior, about the 
vear 1628. Cyrilhis Ijrought it with him 
from Alexandria, whei'c probably it was 
written. In a schedule annexed to it, he 
gives this account : — That it was writ- 
ten, as tradition informed them, by 
Thecla, a noble Egyptian lady, about 
loOO vears ago, not long after the coim- 
cil of t-Jice. But this higii antiquity, and 
the authority of the tradition to which 
the patriarch refers, have l)een dispu- 
ted; nor are the most accurate biblical 
writers agreed about its age. Grabe 
thinks that it might have been written 
before the end of the fourth century; 
others are of opinion that it was not 
written till near the end of the fifth 
century, or somewhat later. See Dr. 
lVoide''s edition of it. 
ALKORAN. ■ See Koran. 
ALL-SUFFICIENCY OF GOD, is 
that power or attribute of his nature 
whereby he is alile to communicate as 
much l/lessedness to his creatures as he 
is pleased to ma.ke tliem capable of re- 
ji ceiving. As his se/f-sufficiencij is that 
jj whereby he has enough in himself to 
{ denominate him completely blessed, as 
j| a God of infinite perfection; so his all- 
|! sujjicicucy is that by which he hath 
jj enough in himself to satisfy the most 
i enlarged desires of his ci-eatures, and 
to make them completely blessed. We 
practically deny this ])erfection, when 
we are discontented with our present 
condition, and desire more than God has 
allotted for us, Gen. iii. 5. Prov. xix. 3. 
-7-2. When we seek blessings of what 
kind soever in an indirect way, as though 
God were not able to bestow them upon 
us in his ov/n way, or in the use of lawful 
nieans, Gen. xxvii. 35. — 3. When v/c 
use unlawful means to escajje imminent 
dangers, 1 Sam. xxi. 13. Gen. xx. and 



ALM 



xxvi. — 4. When we distrust his provi- 
dence, though we had large experience 
of his appearing for us in various instan- 
ces, 1 Sam. xxvii. 1. Ps. Ixxviii. 19. 2 
Chron. xvi. 8. 2 Chron. xiv. 9. ]3. Josh. 
vii. 7. 9. — 5. When we doubt of the truth 
or certain accomplishment of the pro- 
mises. Gen. xviii. 12. Ps. Ixxvii. T4. Isa. 
xlix. 14. — 6. When we decline great 
services, though called to them by God, 
under a pretence of our unfitness for 
them, Jer. i. 6, 8. 

The consideration of this doctrine 
should lead us, 1. To seek happiness hi 
God alone, and not in human things, 
Jer. ii. 13. — 2. To commit all our wants 
and trials to him, 1 Sam. xxx. 6. Ileb. 
xi. 19. 2 Cor. xii. 8, 9. — 3. To be covua- 
geous in the midst of danger and oppo- 
sition, Ps. xxvii. 1. — 4. To be satished 
with his dispensations, Rom. viii. 28. — 
5. To persevere in the path of dut}^,

ALMARICIANS, a denomination 
that arose in the thirteenth century. 
They derived their origin from Alma- 
ric, professor of logic and theology at 
Paris. His adversaries charged him with 
having taught that every Christian was 
obliged to believe himself a member of 
Jesus Christ, and that without this be- 
lief none could be saved. His followers 
asserted that the power of the Father 
had continued only during the Mosaic 
dispensation, that of tlie Son twelve 
hundred years after his entrance upon 
earth; and that in the thirteenth cen- 
tury the age of the Holy Spii'it com- 
menced, in which the sacraments and 
all external worship were to be abo- 
lished ; and that every one was to be 
saved by the internal operations of the 
Holy Spirit alone, without any external 
act of religion. 

ALMONER, a person employed by 
another, in the distribution of cliaritv. 
In its primitive sense it denoted an offi- 
cer in religious houses, to whom be- 
longed the management and distribu- 
tion of the alms of the house. 

ALMS, what is given gratuitously for 
the relief of the poor, and in repah'ing 
the churches. That alms-giving is a duty 
is every wAy evident from the variety of 
passages which enjoin it in the sacred 
scriptures. • It is observable, howe\'er, 
what a number of excuses are made by 
those who are ot found in the exercise 
of the duty : 1. That they have nothing 
to spare; 2. That charity begins at 
home ; 3. That charity does not consist 
in giving money, but in benevolence, 



18 AMA 

love to all mankind, &amp;c. 4. That giving^ 
to the poor is not mentioned in St. Paul^ 
description of charity, 1 Cor. xiii. 5. 
That they pay the poor rates ; 6. That 
they employ mtuiy poor persons; 7. 
That the poor do not suffer so much as 
we imagine ; 8. That these people, give 
them wliat you will, will never be thank- 
ful ; 9. That we are liable to be imposed 
upon; 10. That they should apply to 
their parishes; 11. That giving money 
encourages idleness; 12. 1 hat v/e have 
too many objects of charity at home. O 
the love of money, how fruitful is it in 
apologies for a contracted mercenary 
spirit! In giving of alms, however, the 
following rules should be o])served : first. 
They should be given with justice; 
only our own, to which we have a just 
right, should be given. 2. With cheer- 
fulness, Ucut. XV. 10. 2 Cor. ix. 7. 3. 
\Mth sim/ilicitu cuid sincerity, Rom. xii. 
Matt. vi. 3. 4. Witii co?nfiassion aiid af- 
fection, Isa. Iviii. 10. 1 Joim iii. 17. 5. 
Seasonably, Gal." vi. 10. Prov. iv. 27. 6. 
Bountifully, Deut. xviii. 11. 1 Tim vi. 
18. 7. Prudently, according to CA^ery 
one's need, 1 Tim. v. 8. Acts iv. 35. See

Bounty to the Poor, which took him up.

ALOGIANS, a sect of ancient here- 
tics who denied that Jesus Christ was 
the Logos, and consequently rejected 
the Gospel of St. John. The word is 
compounded of the primitive a and xo^or ; 
q. d. ivithout Logos, or word. They 
made their appearance toward the close 
of the second century. ^ 

ALTAR, a kind of table or raised 
place whereon the ancient sacrifices 
were offered. 2. Tiie table, in Christian 
churches, where the Loi-d's supper is 
administered. Altars are, doubtless, of 
great antiquity; some suppose they 
were as early as Adam ; but there is no 
mention made of them till after the 
flood, when Noah built one, and offered 
burnt offerings on it. The Jews had 
two altars in and about their temple; 
1 . The altar of burnt offerings ; 2. The 
altar of incense ; some also call the ta- 
ble for shew bread an altar, but impro- 
jjerly, Exod. xx. 24, 25. 1 Kings xviii. 
30. Exod. XXV. xzvii. and xxx. Heb. ix. 

AMAURITES, the followers of 
Amauri, a clergyman of Bonne, in the 
tliirteenth century. He acknowledged 
the divine Three, to whom he attributed 
the empire of the world. But according 
to him, religion had three epochas, 
which bore a similitude to the reign of 
the three persons in the Trinity. The 



AME

ANA 



reign of God had existed as long tis the 
law of Moses. The reigii of the Son 
would not always last. A time would 
come when the sacraments should cease, 
and then the religion of the Holy Ghost 
would begin, when men would render a 
spiritual worship to the Supreme Being. 
This reign Amauri thought would suc- 
ceed to the Christian religion, as the 
Christian had succeeded to that of Mo- 
ses. 

AMAZEMENT, a term sometimes 
employed to express our v/onder; but 
it is rather to be considered as a medium 
between wonder and astonishment. It 
is manifestly boiTowed from the exten- 
sive -and complicated intricacies of a 
labyrinth, in Avhich there are endless 
mazes, without the discovery of a clue. 
Hence an idea is conveyed of more than 
simple wonder ; the mind is lost in won- 
der. See Wonder. 

AMBITION, a desii-e of excelling, 
or at least of being thought to excel, 
our neighbours in any thing. It is gene- 
rally used in a bad sense for an immo- 
derate or illegal pursuit of power or 
honour. See Praise. 

AMEDIANS, a congregation of i-e- 
ligious in Italy; so called from their 
professing themselves amantes Deum, 
"lovers of God;" or rather amata Deo, 
"beloved of God." They wore a grey 
habit and wooden shoes, had no breech- 
es, and girt themselves with a cord. 
They had twenty-eight convents, and 
were united by Pope Pius V. partly 
with the Bistercian order, and partly 
with that of the Socolanti, or wooden 
shoe wearers. 

AMEN, a Hebrew word, which, 
when prefixed to an assertion, signifies 
assuredly, certainly, or emphatically, so 
it is; but when it concludes a prayer, so 
be it, or .so let it be, is its manifest im- 
port. In the fonner case, it is assertive, 
or assures of a truth or a fact ; and is an 
asseveration, and is properly translated 
yerily, John iii. 3. In the latter case it 
\% petitionary, and, as it wei"e, epitomises 
all the requests with wiiich it stands 
connected. Numb. v. 25. Rev. xxii. 20. 
This emphatical teiTn was not used 
among the Hebrews by detaclied indi- 
viduals only, but on certain occasions, by 
an assembly at large, Deut. xxvii. 14. 20. 
It was adopted also, in the public wor- 
ship of the primitive churches, as ap- 
pears by that passage, 1 Cor. xiv. 16. 
and was continued among the Chris- 
tians in following times; yea, such was 
the extreme into which many inin, that 
Jerome informs us, that, in his time, at 
the conclusion of every public prayer, 
the united amen of the people sounded 



like the fall of water, or the noise of 
thunder. Nor is the practice of some 
professors in our own time to be com- 
mended, who, with a low though audi- 
ble voice, add their amen to almost eve- 
ry sentence, as it proceeds from the lips 
of him who is praying. As this has a 
tendency to intciTupt the devotion ol" 
those that are near them, and may dis- 
concert the thoughts of him who lead*'; 
the worship, it would be better omitted, 
and a meiital amen is sufficient. The 
term, as used at the end of our prayers, 
suggests that we should pray with un- 
derstanding, faith, fervour, and expec- 
tation. See Mr. Booth's Arnen to social 
Jiraiier. 

AMMONIANS. See New Plato- 
nics. 

AMSDORFIANS, a sect, in the six- 
teenth centuiy, v\'ho took their name 
from Amsdorf, their leader. They 
maintained that good works were not 
only unprofitable, but were obstacles to 
salvation. 

AMYRALDISM, a name given by 
some writers to the doctrine of univer- 
sal grace, as explained and asserted by 
Amyraldus or Moses Amyi-ault, and 
others, his followers, among the reform- 
ed in France, towards the middle of 
the seventeenth century. This doctrine, 
principally consisted of the following 

Particulars, viz. that God desires the 
appiness of all men, and none are ex- 
cluded by a divine decree; that none 
can obtain salvation without faith in 
Christ; that God refuses to none the 
power of believing, though he does not 
grant to all his assistance that they may 
improve this power to saving puiposes; 
and that they may perish through their 
own fault. Those who embraced this 
doctrine were called Universalists ; 
though it is evident they rendered grace 
universal in words, hxiX partial hi reality. 
See Camkronites. 

ANABAPTISTS, those who main- 
tain that baptism ought always to be 
performed by immersion. The word is 
compounded of ^tia, " new," and Baa-T/trTxc, 
"a Baptist," signifying that those who 
have been baptized m their infancy, 
ought to be baptized aneiv. It is a word 
which has been indiscriminately applied 
to Christians of very different principles 
and practices. The English and Dutch 
Baptists do not consider the word as at. 
all applicable to their sect; liecause 
those persons whom they bajjtize they 
consider as never having been baptized 
before, although they have undergone 
what they terrn the ceremony of sprink- 
ling in their infancy. 
The Anabaptists of Germany, besides

their notions concerning bapti.sm, de- 
pended much ipon certain ideas which 
they entertained concerninp; a perfect 
church estabhshment, pure in its mem- 
bers, and free from the institutions of 
human policy. The most prudent part 
of them considered it possible, by hu- 
man industry and ^'igiIancc, to purify 
the church; and seeing the attempts of 
Luther to be successful, they hoped that 
the period was arrived in v/hich the 
church Avas to be restored to this purity. 
Others, not satisfied with Luther's plan 
of reformation, undertook a more per- 
fect plan, or more properly, a Aisionary 
entei-prise, to found a new church en- 
tirely spiritual and divine. 

This sect was soon joined by gi'eat 
numbers, whose characters and capaci- 
ties were very different. Their progress 
was rapid; for in a very short space of 
time, their discourses, visions, and pre- 
dictions, excited great commotions in a 
great part of Evu'ojie. The most per- 
nicious faction of all those v/iiich com- 
posed this motley multitude, was thiit 
which pretended that the foimders of 
this 7ieiu and /m-fect church were un- 
der a divine impidse, and were armerl 
against all opposition by the pov.-er of 
workuig miracles. It was this faction, 
that, in the year 1521, began their fana- 
tical work under the giiidance of Mun- 
7.ey, Stubner, Storick, &amp;;c. These men 
taught that, among Christians, wlio had 
the precepts of the gospel to direct, and 
the Spirit of God to guide them, the of- 
fice ot magistracy was not only unneces- 
sary, but aji unlawful encroachment on 
their spiritual libert}' ; that the distinc- 
tions occasioned by birth, rank, or 
wealth should be abolished; that all 
Christians, throwing their possessions 
into one stock, should live together in 
that state of equality which becomes 
members of the same family ; that, as 
neither the laws of nature, nor tlie pre- 
cepts of the New Testament, had pro- 
hioited polygamy, they should use the 
same liberty as' the jpatriarchs did in 
this respect. 

They employed, at first, the various 
arts ot ptrsuasion, in order to propa- 
gate their doctrines, and related a num- 
ber of visions and revelations, with which 
ihey pretended to have been favoured 
from above : but when they found that 
this would not avail, and that the minis- 
try of Luther and other reformers Avas 
detrimental to their cause, they then 
madly attempted to propagate tlieir 
sentiments by force of arms. Munzer 
and his associates, in the year 1525 ])ut 
themsehes at the head of a numerous 
araiy, and declared war against all laws. 



governments, and magistrates of even- 
kind, under the chimerical pretext, that 
Christ himself was now to take the 
reins of all govei-nment into his hands; 
but this seditious crowd was routed and 
dispersed by the elector of Saxony and 
other princes, and Munzer, their leader, 
put to death. 

Many of his followers, however, sur- 
vived, and pro})agated their opinions 
through GenTiany, Switzerland, and 
Holland. In 1533, a party of them set- 
tled at Munster, under two leaders of 
the names of Matthias and Bocklioldt. 
Having made themselves masters of the 
city, they deposed the magistrates, con- 
fiscated the estates of such as had esca- 
ped, and deposited the wealth in a pub- 
lic treasury for common use. They 
made preparations for the defence of 
the city ; invited the Anabaptists in the 
low countries to assemble at Munster, 
whicli they called Mount Sion, that from 
thence they might reduce all the nations 
of the earth umier their dominion. Mat- 
thias was soon cut off by the bisliop of 
Minister's army, and was succeeded b}/ 
Bockholdt, who was proclaimed by 'a 
special designation ot heaven, as the 
pretended king of Sion, and invested 
with legislatiAe powers like those of 
Moses. The city of Munster, however, 
was taken, after a long siege, and Bock- 
holdt was punished with death. 

It must be acknowledged that the true 
rise of the insurrections of this period 
ought not to be attributed to religious 
opinions. The first insurgents groaned 
under severe oppressions, and took up 
arms in defence of their civil liberties; 
and of these commotions the Anabap- 
tists seem rather to have availed them- 
selves, than to have been the prime 
movers. That a great part were Ana- 
baptists, seems indisputable ; at the same 
time it appears from history, that a great 
part also were Roman catholics, and a 
still greater part of those who had 
scarcely any religious principles at all. 
Indeed, when we read of the vast num- 
bers that were concerned in these in- 
surrections, of whom it is reported that 
100,000 fell by tlie sword, it appears 
reasonable to conclude that they were 
not all Anabaptists. 

It is but justice to observe also, that 
the Baptists in England and Holland 
are to he considered in a different light 
from those above-mentioned: they pro- 
fess an equal aversion to all principles 
of reljcUion on the one hand, and to en- 
thusiasm on the other. See Robertson's 
Hist, of Charles V.; Enc. Brit. vol. i. p.

ANALO(iY OF FAITH, is the pit)- 
poition that the doctrines of tlie gospel 
bear to each othei-, or the close con- 
nexion between the tniths of revealed 
religion, Rom. xii. 6. This is considered 
as a gi-and nile for understanding the 
true sense of scripture. It is evident that 
the Almighty doth not act without a 
design in the system of Christianity any 
more than he does in the v/orks of na- 
ture. Now this design must be uniform ; 
for as in the system of the universe 
every part is proportioned to the whole, 
and made subservient to it, so in the sys- 
tem of the Gospel all the various tiniths, 
doctrines, declai-ations, precepts, and 
promises, must correspond with and 
tend to the end designed. For instance, 
supposing the glory of God in the salva- 
lion of man by free gi-ace be the grand 
design ; then, whatever doctrine, asser- 
tion, or hypothesis, agree not with this, 
It is to be considerecl as false. — Great 
care, however, must be taken in making 
use of this method, that the enquirer pre- 
viously understand the whole scheme, 
and that he harlDOur not a predilection 
only for a jiart ; without attention to this 
we shall be liable to error. If we come 
to the scriptures v/ith any pre-conceived 
opinions, and are more desirous to put 
that sense upon the text which quad- 
rates with our sentiments rather than 
the truth, it becomes then the analogy 
of otir faith, rather than that of the 
whole system. This was the source of 
the error of the Jews, in our Sa\'iour's 
time. They searched the scriptvu-es: 
but, such were their favourite opinions, 
that they could not or would not disco- 
ver that the sacred volume testified of 
Chi'ist. And the reason was evident, 
for their great rule of intei-protation 
was what they might call the analogy 
of faith; i. e. the system of the Phari- 
sean scribes, the doctrine then in vogaie, 
and m the profound veneration of winch 
they had been educated. Perhaps there 
is hardly any sect but v/hat has more or 
less been guilty in this respect. It may, 
however, be of use to the serious and 
candid enquirer; for, as some texts may 
seem to contradict each other, and dif- 
ficulties present themselves, by kee])ing 
the analogy of faith in vievv^, he will the 
more easily resolve those difficulties, 
and collect the true sense of the sacred 
oracles. What " the aphoi-isms of Hip- 
pocrates arc to a physician, the axioms 
m geometry to a mathematician, the 
adjudged cases in law to a counsellor, or 
the maxims of war to a general, such is 
the analogy of faith to a Christian." Of 
the analogy of religion to the constitu- 
tion and course of jiature, we must refer 



our readers to bishop Butler's excellent 
treatise on that subject. 

ANACHORETS, or Anchorites, 
a sort of monks in the primitive churcli, 
who retired from the society of man- 
kind into some deseat, with a view to 
avoid the temj^tations of the world, and 
to be more at leisure for prayer, medi- 
tation, ^cc. Such were Paul, Anthony, 
and Ililarion, the first founders of mo- 
nastic life in Egypt and Palestine. 

ANAGOGICAL, signifies myste- 
rious, transporting ; and is used to ex- 
press Avhatever elevates the mind, not 
only to the knowledge of divine things, 
but of divine things in the next life. The 
word is seldom used, but with regard to 
the different senses of Scripture. The 
anagogical sense is when the sacred 
text is explained with regard to eternal 
life, the point which Christians should 
have in view ; for example, the rest of 
the sabbath, in the anagogic?.! sense, 
signifies the repose of everlasting hap- 
piness. 

ANATHEMA, imports whatever is 
set apart, separated, or divided ; but is 
most usually meant to express the cut- 
ting off of a person from the communioit 
of the faithful. It was pi-actised in the 
primiti\e church against notorious offen- 
ders. Several councils also have pro- 
nounced anathemas against such as they 
thought corrupted the purity of the 
faith. Anathema Maranatha, mention- 
ed by Paul, (1 Cor. xiv. 22.) imports that 
he who loves not the Lord Jesus will be 
accursed at his coming. Anathema sig- 
nifies a thing devoted to destruction, and 
Maranatha is a Syriac word, signifying 
the Lord comes. It is probable in this 
passage there is an allusion to the form 
of the Jews, who when unable to inflict 
so great a punishment as the crime de- 
sen'ed, devoted the culprit to the im- 
mediate vindictive retribution of divine 
vengeance, both in this life and in a fu- 
ture state. 

ANDRONA, a term used for that 
part in churches which was destined for 
the men. Anciently it was the custom 
for the men and women to have sepa- 
rate apartments in places of worship, 
where thev peiiormed their devotions 
asunder, which method is still religious- 
ly oliscrved in the Greek church. 

ANGEL, a spiritual intelligent sub- 
stance, the first in rank and dignity 
among created beings. The word angel 
{xyy.xoi) is Greek, and signifies a mes- 
seugei-. The Hebrew word yh-a signi- 
fies the same. Angels, therefore in the 
proper signification of tlie word, do not 
import the nature of any being, but only 
the office to which they are appointed.

^'Specially by way of message or inter- 
course between God and his creatures. 
Hence the word is used differently in 
various parts of the scripture, and signi- 
fies, 1. Human messengers, or agents 
for others, 2 Sam. ii. 5. "David sent 
Messengers (Heb. angels) to Jabesh 
Gilead, rrov. xiii. 17. Mark i. 2. James 
ii. 25. — 2. Officers of the churches^ 
whether prophets or ordinary minis- 
ters, Hag. i. 13. Rev. i. 20. — 3. Jesus 
Chi'ist, Mai. iii. 1. Isa. Ixiii. 9. — 4. Some 
add the dispensations of God's provi- 
dence, either beneficial or calamitous. 
Gen. xxiv. 7. Ps. xxxiv. 7. Acts xii. 23. 
1 Sam. xiv. 14; but I must confess, that, 
though I do not at all see the impro- 
priety of considering the providences of 
God as his angels or messengers for 
good or for e\"il, yet the passages gene- 
rally adduced under this head do not 
prove to me that the providences of 
God are meant in distinction fiTim cre- 
ated angels. — 5. Created intelligences, 
both good and bad, Heb. i. 14. Jude 6. 
the subject of the present article. — As 
to the time when the angels were crea- 
ted, much has been said by the learned. 
Some wonder that Moses, in his account 
of the ci'eation, should pass over this in 
silence. Others suppose that he did this 
because of tlie proneness of the Gentile 
world, and e\en the Jews, to idolatry ; 
but a better reason has been assigned by 
others, viz. that this first history was 
pmposely and principally written for in- 
formation concerning the visible world; 
tlie invisil)le, of which we know but in 
]^ai't, being reserved for a better life, 
borne think that the idea of God's not 
creating them before this world was 
made, is very contracted. To suppose, 
say they, that no creatures whatever, 
neither angels nor other worlds, had 
been created previous to the creation 
of our world, is to suppose that a Being 
of infinite poM'cr, wisdom, and good- 
ness, had remained totally inactive from 
all eternity, and had permitted the in- 
finity of space to contuiue a perfect va- 
cuum till within these 6000 jears ; that 
such an idea only tends to discredit re- 
velation, instead' of serving it. On the 
other hand it is alleged, that they must 
have been created within the six days; 
because it is said, that within this space 
God made heaven and earth, and all 
things that are therein. It is, howe\-er, 
a needless speculation, and we dare not 
indulge a spu-it of conjecture. It is our 
happniess to know that they are all mi- 
nistering spirits, sent foith to minister 
to them who are heirs of salvation. As 
to the nature of these beings, we are 
eoljd that they are spii'its; but whether} 



pure spirits divested of all matter, or 
united to some thin bodies, oi- cf&gt;i'i&gt;oreal 
vehicles, has been a controversy of l(-ng 
standing: the more general opinion is, 
that they are substances entirely spi- 
ritual, thcaigh they can at any tinie as- 
sume bodies, and appear in human 
shape, (ien. xviii. and xix. Gen. xxxii. 
Matt, xxviii. Luke i. &amp;c. The scrip- 
tures represent them as endued with 
extraordmary wisdom and power, 2 
Sam. xiv. 20". Ps. ciii. 20; holy and re- 
gular in their inclinations; zealous ia 
their employ, and completely happy in 
their minds, Job xxxviii. 7. Heb. i. 7. 
Matt, xviii. 10. Their mimber seems to 
be great, Ps. Ixviii. 17. Heb. xii. 22; and 
perhaps have distinct orders. Col. i. 16, 
17. 1 Pet. iii. 22. 1 Thes. iv. 16. Dan. x. 
13. They are delighted with the ?;r;'Jid 
scheme ot" redemption, and the con\ er- 
sion of sinners to God, Luke ii. 12. i Pet, 
i. 12. Luke xv. 10. They not onlv wor- 
ship Ciod, and execute his commands at 
large, but are attendant on the saints of 
(iod while here below, Ps. xci. 11, 12. 
Heb. i. 13. Luke xvi. 22. Some conjec- 
ture that every good man has his par- 
ticular guardian angel, Matt, xviii. 10. 
Acts xii. 15 ; but this is easier to be sup- 
posed than to be proved; nor is it a 
matter of consequence tn know. " What 
need we dispute," says Henry, "whether 
e^^ery particular saint has a guardian 
angel, when we are sure he IvA'A-Aguard 
of angels about him ?" They will gather 
the elect in the last day, attend the final 
judgment, Matt, xxv.31. Rev. xiv. 18. 
Matt. xiii. 39, and live for ever in the 
world of glory, Luke xx. 36. 

Although tlie angels were originally 
created perfect, yet they were mutable ; 
some of them sinned, and kept not their 
first estate ; and so, of the most blessed 
and glorious, became the most vile and 
miserable of all God's creatures. They 
were expelled the regions of light, and 
with heaven lost their heavenly dispo- 
sition, and fell into a settled rancour 
against God, and malice against men. 
\\^hat their offence was is difficult lo 
determine, the scripture being silent 
about it. Some think envy, others un- 
belief; but most suppose it was pride. 
As to the time of their fall, we are cei'- 
tain it could not be before the sixth day 
of the creation, because on that day it 
is said, "God saw everything that he 
had made, and behold it was very good ;" 
but that it was not long after, is very pro- 
bable, as it must have preceded the fall 
of our first parents. The number of the 
fallen angels seems to be great, and, like 
the holy angels, perhaps have various 
oi'ders among them. Matt. xii. 24. Eph.

Their constant employ is not only doing 
evil themselves, but endeavouring by 
all arts to seduce and pervert mankind, 
1 Pet. V. 8. Job i. 6. It is supposed they 
will be restrained during the millen- 
nium, Rev. XX. 2, but afterwards again, 
for a short time, deceive the nations, Rev. 
XX. 8, and then be finally punished, Matt. 
XXV. 41. The authors who have written 
on this subject have been very nume- 
rous ; we shall only refer to a few : Rey- 
nolda's Enquiry into the State and (Eco- 
nonnj of the Angelical World ; Dod- 
dridge's Led. p. 10. lect. 210. to 214; 
Milton's Paradise Lost ; Bfi. Al'tutoti's 
JFor/cs,\o\. iii. p. 538, 568; She/iherd 
of Angels ; Giljiin on Temptation; Cas- 
manni Angelografihia ; Gill and Ridge- 
ley's Bodies of Divinity. 

ANGELlCS, an ancient sect, sup- 
posed by some to have got this appella- 
tion from their excessive veneration of 
angels, and by others from maintaining 
that the world was created by angels. 

ANGELITES, a sect in tlie reign of 
tlie emperor Anastasius, about tlie year 
494 ; so called from Angelium, a place 
in the city of Alexandria, where they 
held their first meetings. They were 
called likewise Severites, from Severus, 
who was the head of their sect ; as also 
Theodosians, from one Theodosius, 
whom they made pope at Alexandria. 
They held that the persons of the tri- 
nity are not the same; tlAt none of 
them exists of himself, and df his own 
nature ; but that there is a common 
God or Deity existing in them all, and i 
that each is God by a participation of 
this Deity. 

ANGER, a violent passion of the 
xnind, arising from the receipt, or sup- 
posed receipt, of any injury, with a pre- 
sent purpose of revenge. All anger is 
bv no means sinful ; it was designed by 
the Author of our nature for self-de- 
fence ; nor is it altogether a selfisli pas- 
sion, since it is excited by injuries offer- 
ed to others as well as ourselves, and 
sometimes prompts us to reclaim offen- 
ders from sin and danger, Eph. iv. 26 ; 
but it becomes sinful when conceived 
upon trivial occasions or inadequate 
provocations ; when it breaks forth into 
outrageous actions ; vents itself jn re- 
viling language, or is concealed in our 
thoughts to the degree of hatred. To 
suppress this passion the following re- 
flections of arch-deacon Paley, may not 
be unsuitable : "We should consider the 
possibility of mistaking the motives from 
whicli the conduct that offends us pro- 
ceeded; how often our offences have 
been the effect of inadvertency, when 



they were construed into indications of 
malice ; the inducement which prompted 
our adversary to act as he did, and now 
powerfully the same uiducement has, at 
one time or other, operated upon our- 
selves; that he is suffering, perhaps, 
under a contrition, which he is ashamed, 
or wants opportunity to confess; and 
how ungenerous it is to triumph by cold- 
ness or insult over a spirit already hum- 
bled in secret; that the returns of kind- 
ness are sweet, and that there is neither 
honour, nor virtue, nor use, in resisting 
them; for some persons think them- 
selves bound to cherish and keep alive 
their indignation, when they find it dy- 
ing away of itself. VVe may remember 
that others have their passions, their 
prejudices, their favourite aims, their 
fears, their cautions, their interests, 
tlieir sudden impulses, their varieties of 
appreliension, as well as we : we may re- 
collect what hath sometimes passed in 
our own minds when we have got on the 
wrong side of a quairel, and imagine the 
same to be passing in our adversary's 
mind novv': when we became sensible 
of our misbehaviour, what palliations 
v/e perceived in it, and expected others 
to perceive ; how we were affected by 
the kindness, and felt the superiority 
of a generous reception, and ready 
forgiveness; how persecution revived 
our spirits with our enmity, and seemed 
to justify the conduct in ourselves, 
which we before blamed. Add to this 
the indecency of extravagant anger; 
how it renders us while it lasts, the 
scorn and sport of all about us, of whicFi 
it leaves us, when it ceases, sensible and 
ashamed ; the inconveniences and irre- 
trievable misconduct into which oui' 
irascibility has sometimes betrayed us ; 
the friendships it has lost us; the dis- 
tresses and embarrassments in whicli 
we have been involved by it ; and the 
repentance which, on one account or 
other, it always costs us. But the reflec- 
tion calculated above all others to allay 
that haughtiness of temper which is 
ever finding out provocations, and which 
renders anger so impetuous, is, that 
wliich the Gospel proposes; namely, 
that we ourselves are, or shortly shall 
be, suppliants for mercy and pardon at 
the judgment seat of God. Imagine our 
secret sins all disclosed and brought to 
light; imagine us thus humbled and ex- 
posed; trembling under the hand of 
God; casting ourselves on his compas- 
sion; crying out for mercy; imagine 
such a creature to talk of satisfaction 
and revenge ; refusing to be entreated, 
disdaining to forgive; extreme to mark 
and to resent what is done amiss; ima-

excepting chui'ch government. 

ANNIH1LATK)N, the act of reduc- 
ing any created being into nothing. The 
sentiments of mankind have differed 
widely as to the possibility and impos- 
sibility of annihilation. According to 
some, nothing is so difiicult ; it I'equires 
the infinite power of God to effect it: 
according to others, nothing so easy. 
Existence, say they, is a state of vio- 
lence ; all things are continually endea- 
vouring to return to their primitive no- 
thing: it recjuires no power at all; it will 
do it itself: nay, more, it requires an 
infinite power to prevent it. With re- 
spect to human beings, it appears pro- 
bable from reason ; but it is confirmed 
by Scripture that they will not be anni- 
hilated, but exist in a future state, Matt.

ANNUNCL\TION, the tidings 
brought by the angel Gabriel to the 
virgin Mary of the incarnation of Christ. 
It is also used to denote a festival kept 
Ijy the church on the 25th of March, m 
commemoration of these tidings. 

ANOMOEANS, the name by which 
the pure Arians were called in the 
fourth century, in contradistinction to 
the Semi-arians. The word is formed 
from the Greek nvojuoiou different. See 
Arians and Semi-arians. 

ANTEDILUVIANS, a general nam* 
for all mankind who lived before the 
fiood, including the whole human race 
from the creation to the deluge. For 
the history of the Antediluvians, see 
Book of Genesis. JV/iistoti's Josefihus, 
Cockburn's Treatise on the Deluge, and 
article Deluge. 

ANTHEM, a church song performed 
in cathedral service by choristers who 
sung alternately. It was used to denote 
both psalms and hymns, when perform- 
ed in this manner; but, at present, an- 
them is used in a more confined sense, 
being applied to certain passages taken 
out of the scriptures, and adapted to a 



particular solemnity. AntlienvS were 
fii'st introduced in the reformed service 
of the English church, ui the beginning 
oi the reign of queen Elizabeth. 

ANTHROPOMORPHITES, a sect 
of ancient heretics, who, taking every 
thing spoken of God in the scripture in 
a literal sense, particularly that passage 
of Genesis in which it is said, "God 
made man after his own image," main- 
tained that God had a human shape. 

ANTHROPOPATHY, a figure, ex- 
pression, or discourse, whereby some 
passion is attributed to God which pro- 
perly Ijclongs only to man. yVntliropo- 
pathy is frcquentlj' used promiscuously 
with anthropology; ^"et in strictness 
tiiey ought to be distinguished, as the 
genus from the species. Anthropology 
may be understood of any thing human 
attributed to God, as eyes, hands, &amp;c. 
but anthropopathy only of human affec- 
tions and passions, as joy, grief. We 
ha\'e frequent instances of the use of 
these figiires in holy scripture. 

ANTIBURGHERS, a numerous and 
respectable body of dissenters from the 
church of Scotland, who differ from the 
established church chielly in matters of 
church go^•ernment; and who differ, 
also, from the Burgher seceders, with 
whom they were originally united, chicf- 
] ly, if not solely, respecting the lawful- 
ness of taking the Burgess oath. For an 
account of tlieir origin and principles, 
see SECEr)*:RS. 

ANTICHRIST, an adversary to Je- 
sus Christ. There ha\e been various 
opinions concerning the Antichrist men- 
tioned in the Scripture, 1 John ii. 18. 
Some have held that the Jews are to be 
reputed as Antichrist; others Caligula; 
others Mahomet; others Simon Magus j 
others infidelity; and others, that the 
devil himself is the Antichrist. Most 
authors agree, however, that it applies 
to the church of Rome. Grotius, Ham- 
mond, Bossuet, and others, supposed 
Rome pagan to be designed; but Rome 
Christian seems more evident, for John 
"saw the beast rise up out of the sea," 
Rev. xiii. 1. Now, as heathen Rome had 
risen and been established long before 
his time, this could not refer &gt;.o the Ro- 
man empire then suljsisting, but to a 
form oi government afterwards to arise. 
As, therefore, none did arise, after 
Rome was broken to pieces by the bar- 
barians, but that of the papal power, it 
must be considered as applying to that. 
The descriptions also, of the beast as 
the great apostacy, the ?nan of sin, the 
my.kery of umjuiiy , Jind the son of per- 
dition, will apply only to Christian. 
Rome. See Danic! \\\ 2 Thess. ii, and

Rev. xiii. Besides the time allowed for 
the continuance of the beast will not 
apply to heathen Rome; for power was 
given to the beast for 1260 years, where- 
as heathen Rome did not last 400 years 
after this prophecy was delivered. Au- 
thors have differed as to the time when 
Antichrist arose. Some suppose that || 
his reign did not commence till he be- i| 
came a temporal prince, in the year 756, ;| 
when Pepin wrested the exarchate of Ij 
Ravenna fi-om the Lombards, and made ! 
it over to the pope and his successors, j 
Others think that it was in 727, when J 
Rome and the Roman dukedom came i| 
from the Gi-eeks to the Roman pontiff. Jj 
Mede dates this rise in the year 456 ; but ; 
others, and I think with the greatest 
reason, place it in the year 606. Now, it 
is genei-ally agreed that the I'eign of An- 
tichrist is 1260 years ; consequently, if 
his rise is not to be reckoned till he was 
possessed of secular authority, then his 
tall must be when this power is taken 
away. According to the first opinion, he 
must have possessed his temporal power 
till the year 2016 ; according to the se- 
cond, he must have possessed it till the 
}-ear 1987. If this rise began, according 
to Mede, in 456, then he must have fall- 
en in 1716. Now that these dates were 
wrong, circumstances have proved ; the 
first and second being too late, and the 
third too early. As these hypotheses, 
therefore, must fall to the ground, it re- 
mains for us to consider why tlie last 
mentioned is the more probable. It was 
about the year 606 that pope Boniface 
III. by flattering Phocas, the emperor 
of Constantinople, one of the worst of 
tyrants, procured for himself the title of 
Universal Bishop. The bishops of Rome 
and Constantinople had long been strag- 
gling for this honour; at last, it was de- 
cided in favour of the bishop of Rome ; 
and from this time he^was raised above 
all others, and his supremacy establish- 
ed by imperial authority : it was now, 
also, that the most profound ignorance, 
debauchery, and superstition, i*eigned. 
From this time the popes exerted all 
their power in promoting the idolatrous 
worship of images, saints, reliques, and 
angels. The church was truly deplora- 
ble ; all the clergy were giveii up to the 
most flagrant and abominable acts of li- 
centiousness. Places of worship resem- 
bled the temples of heathens more than 
the churches of Christians ; in fine, no- 
thing could exceed the avarice, pride, 
and vanity of all the bishops, presbvters, 
deacons, and even the cloistered monks ! 
All this fully answered the description 
St. Paul gave of Antichrist, 2 Thess. ii. 
It is necessary also to observe, that this 



epoch agrees best with the time when, 
accordingto prophecy, he was to be re- 
vealed. The rise of Antichrist was to 
be preceded by the dissolution of the 
Roman empire, the establishment of a 
different form of government in Italy, 
and the division of the empire into ten 
kingdoms; all tliese events taking place, 
make it ver\' probable that the } ear 606 
was the time of his rise. Nor have the 
events of the last centuiy made it less 
probable. The power of the pope was 
never so much sliaken as within a few 
years: "his dominion is, in a great mea- 
sure, taken from him ;" and every thing 
seems to be going on gradually to ter- 
minate his authority ; so that, by the 
time this 1260 years shall be concluded, 
Ave may suppose that Antichrist shall 
be finally destroyed. 

As to the cruelties of Antichrist, the 
persecutions that have been carried on, 
and the miseries to which mankind have 
been subject, by the power of the beast, 
the reader may consult the articles In- 
quisition and Persecution. In this 
we have to rejoice, that, however vari- 
ous, the opinions of the learned may be 
as to the time when Antichrist rose, it 
is evident to all that he is fast declining, 
and will certainly fall. Rev. xviii. 1, 5. 
W'hat means the Almighty may farther 
use, the exact time when, and the man- 
ner hov/, all shall be accomplished, we 
must leave to him who ordereth all 
things after the counsel of his own will.

ANTIDORON, a name given by the 
Greeks to the consecrated bread ; out of 
which the middle part, mai-ked with 
the cross, wherein the consecration re- 
sides, being taken away by the priest, 
the remainder is distributed after mass 
to the poor. 

ANTINOMIANS, those who main- 
tain that the law is of no use or obliga- 
tion under the gospel dispensation, or 
who hold doctrines that clearly super- 
sede the necessity of good works. The 
Antinomians took their origin from John 
Agricola, about the year 1538, who 
taught that the law is no way necessary 
under the Gospel ; that good works do 
not promote our salvation, nor ill one's 
hinder it ; that repentance is not to be 
preached from the decalogue, but only 
from the Gospel. This sect sprang up 
in England during the protectorate of 
Cromwell, anci extended their system 
of libertinism much farther than Agri- 
cola did. S'^me of them it is s-aid. main-

fainecl, tliat it" they should commit any- 
kind of sin, it would do them no hurt, 
nor in the least affect their eternal state ; 
and that it is one of the distinguishing 
characters of the elect that they cannot 
do any thing displeasing to God. It is ne- 
cessary, lioweA'er, to observe here, and 
candour obliges us to confess that there 
have been others, who have been styled 
Antinomians,who cannot, strictly speak- 
ing, be ranked with these men : never- 
theless, the unguarded expressions they 
liave ad\ anced, the bold positions they 
have laid down, and the doviljle con- 
srtruction which might so easily be put 
upon many of their sentences, have led 
some to charge them with Antinomiaii 
principles. For instance ; Avhen they 
have asserted justification to be eter- 
nal, without distinguishing between the 
secret determination of God m eternity, 
and the execution of it in time ; when \ 
they have spoken lightly of good works, | 
or asserted that believers have nothing 
to do with the law of God, without fully ' 
explaining what they mean: when they 
assert that God is not angry with his 
people for their sins, nor in any sense 
punishes them for them, without distin- 
guishing between fatherly corrections- 
and vindictive punishment: these things, 
whatever be the private s • iitiments of j 
those who advance them, have a ten- 
dency to injure the minds of many. It 
has been alleged, that the principal 
tiling they have had in view, was, to 
counteract those legal doctrines which 
have so much abounded among the self- 
righteous ; but, granting this to be true, 
there is no occasion to run from one 
extreme to another. Had many of tliose 
writers pi'oceeded with more caution, 
been less dogmatical, more explicit in 
the explanation of their sentiments, and 
possessed more candour towards those 
who differed from them, they would 
have been more serviceable to the cause 
of truth and religion. Some of the chief 
of those who have been charged as fa- 
vouring the above sentiments are. Crisp, 
Richardson, Saltmarsh, Hu&amp;sey , Eatom, 
Town, &amp;c. These have been answered 
by Gataker, Sedgwiclc, JVitsius, Bull, 
Williams, Ridgley, Beart, De Fleurij, 
&amp;c. See also Bella?)iy's Letters and 
Dialogues betnveen Theron, Paulinus,

ANTIPATHY, hatred, aversion, re- 
pugnancy, Hatred is entertained against 
persons, a-ye/'siow and antipathy against 
persons or things, and repugnancy 
against actions alone. Hatred is more 
vMuntary than aversion, antipathy, or 



repugnancy : these last have greater 
affinity with the animal constitution. 
The causes of antipathy are less known 
than those of aversion. Repugnancy is 
less permanent than either the one or 
the other. We hate a vicious charac- 
ter, we feel an aversion to its exertions. 
We are affected with antij^athy for cer- 
tain persons at first siglit : there are 
some affairs which Ave transact with re- 
pugnancy. Hatred calumniates, a-j^^r- 
sion keeps us at a distance from certain 
persons. Antipathy makes us detest 
them ; repugnancy hinders us fi'om imi- 
tating them. 

AK^TIP.^DOBAPTISTS, (from «m. 
"against," and ^a/c ^afcTic, "child," and 
Ba^Ti^;.', "baptize,") is a distinguishing 
denomination given to those who object 
to the baptism of infants. See Bap- 
tism. 

ANTIQUITIES, a tei-m implying all 
testimonies or authentic accounts that 
have come down to us of ancient nations. 
As t]ie study of antiquity may be useful 
both to the enquiring Christian, as well 
as to these who are employed in, or are 
candidates for the Gospel ministry, we 
shall here subjoin a list of those which 
are esteemed the most valuable. — Fa-

ANTISABBATARIANS, a modem 
religious sect, who deny the necessity 
of observing the Sabbath Day. Their 
chief arguments are, 1. That tlie Jewish 
Sabbath was only of ceremonial, not of 
moral obligation; and consequently, is 
abolished by the coming of Christ. — 2. 
That no other Sabbath was appointed to 
be observed by Christ or his apostles. — 

3. That there is not a word of Sabbath- 
breaking in all the New Testament. — 

4. That no command was given to Adam 
or Noah to keep any Sabbath. — And, 

5. That, therefore, although Christians 
are commanded "not to forsake the 
assembhng of themselves together," 
they ought not to hold one day more 
holy than another. See article Sab- 
bath. 

ANTITACT^, a brancli of Gnos- 
tics, who held that God was good and 
just, but that a creature had created 
evil J and, consequently, that it is our 



APA

vlutv to oppose this axithor of evil, in or- 
der to avenge God of liis adversary. 

ANTITRINITARIANS, those who 
deny the Trinity, and teach that there 
are not three persons in the Godhead. 
See Trinitv. 

ANTITYPE, a Greek word, pro- 
perly signifying a t}'pe or figure cor- 
responding to some other type. 

The word antitype occurs twice in the^ 
New Testament, viz. in the Epistle to 
the Hebrews, chap. ix. v. 24. and in the 
1 Epistle of St. Peter chap. iii. v. 21. 
where its genuine import has been mucli 
controverted. The former says, that 
Christ is not entered into the holy 
j)laces made with hands, which are 
ewT/TUTa, the figures or antitypes of the 
true — now to appear in the presence of 
God. NowTvrrsc signifies the pattern 
by which another thing is made ; and 
as Moses was obliged to make the ta- 
bernacle, and all things in it, according 
to the pattern shown him in the Movint, 
the tabernacle so formed was the anti- 
type of what was shown to Moses: any 
thing, therefore, formed according to a 
model or jmttern, is an antitype. In the 
latter passage, the apostle, speaking of 
Noah's flood, and the deliverance only 
of eight persons in the ark from it, says, 
n x.cti nfjictc a.vTiTvrrov vcv s-w^si ^ttTrrKry.cL ; Bap- 
tism being an antitype to that, now saves 
us; not the putting avjay of tJie filth of 
the fiesh, but the ansiver of a good co'ii- 
science towards God, &amp;c. The meaning 
is, that righteousness, or the answer ot 
a good conscience towards God, now 
saves us, by means of the resurrection 
of Christ, as formerly righteousness sa- 
ved these eight persons by means of the 
4irk during the flood. The word anti- 
type, therefore, here signifies a general 
similitude of circumstances; and the 
particle co, whereunto, refers not to the 
immediate antecedent •jJ'^'to^, water, but 
to all that precedes. 

ANTOSIANDRIANS, a sect of ri- 
gid Lutherans who opposed the doctrine 
of Osiander relating to justification. 
These are otherwise denominated Osl- 
andromastiges. The Antosiandrian* de- 
ny that man is made just, with that jus- 
tice wherewith (iod himself is just ; that 
is, they assert that he is not made es- 
sentially but only imputatively just ; or 
that he is not really made just, but only 
pronounced so. 

APATHY, among the ancient philo- 
sophers, implied an utter privation of 
passion, and an insensibility of pain. The 
word is conipounded of it/priv. and !ra6of, 
affection. The Stoics afiected an entii'e 
apathy; they considei-ed it as the highest 
tvisdom to enjoy a perfect calmness or 



tranquillity of mind, incapable of being 
ruffied by either pleasure or pain. In the 
first ages of the church, the Christians 
adopted the term apathy to express a 
contempt of all earthly concerns ; a state 
of mortification such as the Gospel pre- 
scribes. Clemens Alexandrinus, in par- 
ticular, brought it exceedingly in vogue, 
thinking hereby to drav/ such philoso- 
phers to Christianity who aspired after 
such a sublime pitch of \ irtue. 

APELLEANS, so called from Apel- 
les, in the second ccnturj-. They af- 
firmed that Christ, when he came down 
from heaven, received a body not from 
the ssbstance of his mother, but from 
the four elements, which at his death he 
rendered back to the world, and so as- 
cended into heaven without a body. 

APHTHARTODOCITES, a deno- 
mination in the sixth century ; so called 
from the Greek c(p9aigToc, incorruptible, 
and i'ox.'Mi, to judge ; because they held 
that the body of Jesus Christ was incor- 
rtiptible, and not subject to death. They 
were a branch of the Eutychians. 

APOCARITiES, a denomination, in 
the thii'd century, which sprang froni 
the Manicheans. They held that the 
soul of man was of the substance of God. 

APOCHRYPIlA,books not admitted 
into the canon of scripture, being either 
spurious, or at least not acknowledged 
as divine. The word is Greek, and de- 
rived from cTo, "fi'om," and y-evTrnm, "to 
hide or conceal." They seem most of 
them to have been composed by Jews. 
None of the writers of the New Testa- 
ment mention them ; neither Philo nor 
Josephus speak of them. The Christian 
church v/as for some ages a stranger to 
them. Origen, Athanasius, Hilar}', Cyril 
of Jerusalem, and all the orthodox wri- 
ters who have given catalogues of the 
canonical books of scripture, unanimous- 
ly concur in rejecting these out of the 
canon. The Protestants acknowledge 
such books of scripture only to be cano- 
nical as were esteemed to be so in the 
first ages of the church ; such as are 
cited by the earliest writers among the 
Chiistians as of divine authority, and 
after the most diligent enquirj^ were re- 
ceived and judged to be so by the coun- 
cil of Laodicea. They were written after 
the days of Malachi, in whom, according 
to the universal testimony of the Jews, 
the spirit of prophecy ceased, Mai. iv. 
4 — 6. Not one ot the' writers in dii^ect 
terms advances a claim to inspiration. 
They contain fables, lies, and contradic- 
tions. 1 Mace. vi. 4. 16. 2 Mace. i. 13. 16. 
2 Mace. ix. 28. The apocryphal books 
are in general believed to be canonical 
by the church of Romej and, even by

the sixth article of the church of Eng- 
land, they are ordered to be read for 
example of life and instruction of man- 
ners, though it doth not apply them to 
establish any doctrine. Other reformed 
churches do not so much as make even 
this use of them. See Prideaux''s Con- 
nexion, vol. i. p. 36 — 42 : Lee^s Dis. on 
JSsdras ; Dick on Insfiiration, p. 344. 

APOLLINARIANS, were ancient 
heretics, who denied the proper hu- 
inanity of Christ, and maintamed that 
the body which he assumed was endow- 
ed with a sensitive and not a rational 
soul : but that the divine nature supplied 
the place of the intellectual principle in 
man. This sect derived its name from 
Ap«llinar!s, bishop of Laodicea. Their 
doctrine was first condemned by a coun- 
cil at Alexandria in 362, and afterwards 
in a more formal manner bv a council 
at Rome in 375, and by another council 
in 378, which deposed Apollinaris from 
his bishopric. This, with other laws 
enacted against them, reduced them to 
a very small number; so that at last 
they dwindled av/ay. 

APOSTACY, a forsaking or rennun- 
cmg our religion, either by an open de- 
claration in woi'ds, or a virtual declara- 
tion of it by our actions. The primitive 
Christian church distinguished several 
kinds of apostacy ; the first, of those 
who went entirely from. Christianity to 
Judaism ; the second, of those who com- 
plied so far with the Jews, as to com- 
municate with them in many of their 
imlawful practices, without making a 
formal profession of their religion ; 
thirdly, of those who mingled Judaism 
and Christianity together ; and, fourth- 
ly! of those who voluntarily relapsed 
into paganism. Apostacy may be far- 
ther considered as, 1. Original,'in which 
■vve have all participated, Rom. iii. 23 ; 
— 2. National, when a kingdom relin- 
quishes the profession of Christianity ; 
— 3. Personal, when an individual back- 
slides from God, Heb. x. 38 ; — 4. Final, 
&gt;vhen men are given up to judicial 
hardness of heart, as Judas. See Back- 
sliding. 

APOSTLE, properly signifies a mes- 
senger or person sent by another upon 
. some business. It is particularly applied 
to them whom our Saviour deputed to 
preach. — 2. Apostle, in the Greek li- 
turgy, is used for a book containing the 
epistles of St. Paul, printed in the order 
•wherein they are to be read in churches 
through the course of the year. — 3. Tlie 
appellation was also given to the ordi- 
nary travelling ministers of the church, 
Rom. xyi. 7. Phil. ii. 25. though in our 
trajislation the last is rendered messen- 



ger.— -4. It is likewise given to those 
persons who first planted the Christian 
faith in any place. Thus Dionj-sius of 
Corinth is called the Apostle of France, 
Xavier the Apostle of the Indies, &amp;c. 

APOSTLES' CREED. See Creed. 

APOSTOLATE, in a general sense, 
is used for mission; but it more proper- 
ly denotes the dignity or office of an 
apostle of Christ. It is also used in an- 
cient writers for the office of a bishop. 
But as the title apostolicus has been ap- 
propriated to the pope, so that of apos- 
tolate became at length restrained to 
the sole dignity of the popedom. 

APOSTOLIC, apostolical ; some- 
thing that relates to the apostles, or 
descends from them. Thus -we say the 
apostolical age, apostolical doctrine, 
apostolical chai'acter, constitutions, tra- 
ditions, 8cc. 

APOSTOLIC, in the primitive 
church, was an appellation given to all 
such churches as were founded by the 
apostles ; and even to the bishops of 
those churches, as being the reputed 
successors of the apostles. These were 
confined to four, viz. Rome, Alexandria, 
Antioch, and Jerusalem. In after times, 
the other churches assumed the same 
quality, on account, principally, of the 
conformity of their doctrine with that 
of the cliurches which were apostolical 
by foundation, and because all bishops 
held themseh es successors of the apos- 
tles, or acted in their dioceses with the 
authority of apostles. 

The first time the term apostolical is 
attributed to bishops, as such, is in a 
letter of Clovis to the council of Orleans, 
held in 511, though that king does not 
there expressly denominate them apos- 
tolical, but {a/wstolica sede dignissiml 
highly worthy of the apostolical see. 
In 581, Guntram calls the bishops met 
at the council of Macon, apostolical 
pontiffs, apostolici pontijices. 

In progress of time, the bishop of 
Rome growing in power above the rest, 
and the three patriarchates of Alexan- 
dria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, falling 
into the hands of the Saracens, the title 
apostolical was restrained to the pope 
and his church alone ; though some of 
the popes, and St. Gregory the Great, 
not contented to hold the title by this 
tenure, began at length to insist that it 
belonged to them by another and pecu- 
liar right, as being the successors of St. 
Peter. The country of Rheims, in 1049, 
declared that the pope Avas the sole 
apostolical primate of the universal 
church. And hence a great number of 
apostolicals ; apostolical see, apostolical 
nuncio, apostolical notary, apoatolicdl

APOSTOLICAL CONSTITU- 
TIONS, a collection of regulations at- 
tributed to the apostles, and supposed 
to have been collected by St. Clement, 
whose name they likewise bear. It is 
the general opinion, however, that they 
are spurious, and that St. Clement had 
no hand in them. They appeared first 
in the fourth century, but have been 
much changed ai^d corrupted since. 
There are so many things hi them dif- 
ferent from and even contrary to the 
genius and design of the New Testa- 
ment writers, that no wise man would 
believe, without the most convincing 
and irresistible proof, that both could 
come from the same hand. Grabe's 
Answer to Whis/on; Saurin's Ser. vol. 
ii. p. 185 ; La?'d?ier's Ci'cd. vol. iii. p. 11.

APOS COLIC FATHERS, an ap- 
pellation usually given to the writers of 
the first century, who employed their 
pens in the cause of Christianity. Of 
these writers, Cotelerius, and after him 
Le Clerc, have published a collection 
in two volumes, accompanied both with 
their oy.'n annotations, and the remarks 
of other learned men. See also the 
genuine epistles of the apostolic fathers 
by Abp. Wake. 

APOSTOLICI, or Apostolics, a 
name assumed by different sects on ac- 
count of their pretending to imitate the 
practice of the apostles. 

APOTACTIT/E, an ancient sect, 
who affected to follow the examples of 
the apostles, and renounced all their 
effects and possessions. It does not ap- 

Eear that they held any errors at first ; 
ut afterwai-ds they taught that the re- 
nouncing of all riches was not only a 
matter of counsel and advice, but of 
precept and necessity. 

APPLICATION, is used for the act 
whereby our Saviour transfers or makes 
over to us what he had earned or pur- 
chased by his holy life and death. Ac- 
cordingly it is by this application of the 
merits of Christ that we are to be justi- 
fied and entitled to grace and glory. 

.dpplication is also used for that part 
of a sermon in which the preacher 
brings home or applies the tnith of re- 
ligion to the consciences of his hearers. 
See Sermon. 

APPROBATION, a state or dispo- 
sition of the mind, wherein we put a 
value upon, or become pleased with, 
some person or thing. Moralists are 
divided on the principle of approbation, 
or the motive which determines us to 
approve or disapprove. The Epicureans 



^9 ARC 

will have it to be only self-interest : ac- 
cording to them, that which determines 
any agent to approve his own action, is 
its apparent tendency to his private hap- 
piness ; and even the approbation of an- 
other's action flows from no other cause 
but an opinion of its tendency to the 
happiness of the approver, either im- 
mediately or remotely. Others resolve 
approbation into a moral sense, or a 
prmciple of benevolence, by which we 
are determined to approve every kind 
aftection either hi ourselves or others, 
and all publicly useful actions which we 
imagine to flow from such affections, 
without any view therein to our owa 
private happiness. 

But may we not add, that a true 
Christian's appi'obation arises from his 

gerception of the will of God? See 
&gt;BLIGATION. 

APPROPRIATION, the annexing a 
benefice to the proper and perpetual 
use of some religious house. It is a term 
also often used in the religious world as 
referring to that act of the mind by 
which we apply the blessings of the 
Gospel to ourselves. This appropria- 
tion IS real when w(* are enabled to be- 
lieve in, feel, and obey the truth ; but 
merely nominal and delusive when there 
are no fniits of righteousness and true 
holiness. See Assurance. 

AQUARIANS, those who consecra- 
ted water in the eucharist instead of 
wine. Another branch of them ap- 
proved of wine at the sacrament, when 
received in the evening : they likewise 
mixed water with the wine. 

ARABICI, en-oneous Christian'- in 
the third century, who thought that the 
soul and body died together, and rose 
again. It is said that Origen convinced 
them of their error, and that they then 
abjured it. 

ARCHANGEL, according to some 
divines, means an angel occupying the 
eighth rank in the celestial hierarchy ; 
but others, not without reason, reckon 
it a title only applicable to our Saviour. 
Compare Jude 9. with Daniel xii. 1. 1 
Thess. iv. 16. 

ARCHBISHOP, the chief or metro- 
politan bishop, who has se\-eral suffra- 
fans under him. Archl^ishops were not 
nown in the East till about the year 
320 ; 'and though there were some soon 
after this who had the title, yet that 
was only a personal honour, by which 
the bishops of considerable cities were 
distinguished. It was not till of late that 
archbishops became metropolitans, and 
had suffragans under them. The ec- 
clesiastical government of England is 
divided into two provinces, viz. Cantei'-

bury unci York. The first archbishop 
of Canterbury was Austin, appointed by 
king Ethelb'ert, on his conversion to 
Christianity, about the year 598. His 
sprace of Canterbuiy is the first peer of 
England, and the next to the royal fa- 
mily, having precedence of all dukes, 
and all great officers of the crown. It 
is his privilege, by custom, to crown 
the kings and queens of this kingdom. 
The archl^ishop of York has precedence 
of all dukes not of the royal blood, and 
of all officers of state except the lord 
high chancellor. The first archbishop 
of York was Paulinas," appointed by 
pope Gregory about the year 622. 

ARCHDEACON, a priest mvested 
with authority or jurisdiction over the 
clergy and laity, next to the bishop, 
either throvigh the whole diocese, or 
only a part of it. There are sixty in 
England, wlio visit every two years in 
three, when they inquire into the re- 
parations and moveables belonging to 
churches; i-eform abuses; suspend; ex- 
communicate ; in some places prove 
wills ; and induct all clerks uito Ijene- 
iices within their respective jurisdic- 
tions. 

ARCHONTICS, a sect about the 
rear 160 or 203. Among many other 
*:"Xtravagant notions, they held that the 
&gt;vorld was created by archangels ; they 
also denied tr.e i-esurrection of the l)ody. 

ARCH-PRESBYTER, or Arch- 
Priest, a priest established irr some '■ 
dioceses with a superioi-ity over the i 
rest- He was anciently chosen out of j 
the college of presbyters, at the pleasure : 
of the bishop. The ai'ch-presbyters 
were much oi the same nature with cur 
deans in cathedral churches. 

ARRKABONARH, a sect who held I 
that the Eucharist is neither the real 
flesh or blood of Christ, nor yet the sign 
of them, but only the pledge or earnest 
thereof, 

ARIANS, ftdlowers cf Arius, a pres- 
byter of the church of Alexandria, about 
315," who maintained that the Son of 
God was totally and essentially distinct 
from the Father; that he v^as'the first 
and noblest of those beings whom God 
had created — the instrament, by whose 
subordinate operation he formed the 
universe ; and therefore, inferior to the 
Father both in nature and dignity :,also, 
that the Holy Ghost was not God, but 
created by the power of the Son. The 
Arians owned that the Son was the 
Word ; but denied that word to have 
been eternal. Thej^ held that Christ 
had nothing of man ni him but the flesh, 
to which the acjo?, or v,'ord, was joined, 
■"A'hich was the s;u)ie as the soul in us.— 



The Arians were first condemned and 
anathematised by a council at y\lexan- 
dria, in 320, under Alexander, bishop 
of that city, who accused Arius of im- 
piety, and caused him to be expelled 
from the communion of the chui-ch ; and 
afterwards by 380 fathers in the general 
council of Nice, assembled by Constan- 
tine, in 325. His doctrine, however, was 
not extinguished ; en the contrary, it 
became the reigning religion, especially 
in the East. Arius was recalled from 
banishment by Constantine in two or 
three years after the council of Nice, 
and the laws that had been enacted 
against him were repealed. Notwith- 
standing this, Athanasius, then bishop 
of Alexandria, refused to admit him and 
his followers to communion. This so 
enraged them, that, by their interest at 
court, they procu i ed that prelate to be 
deposed and banished ; but the church 
of Alexandria still refusing to admit 
Arius into their communion, the empe- 
I'or sent for him to Constantino])le ; 
where upon delivering in a fresh con- 
fession ot his faith in terms less oftensivc, 
the emperor commanded him to be re- 
ceived into their commiuiion ; but that 
ver\" evening, it is said, Arius died as 
his friends were conducting him in tii- 
umph to the great church of Constan- 
tinople. Arius, jiressed by a natural 
want, stepped aside, but expired on the 
spot, his bowels gushing out. The 
Arian party, however, found a jjrotector 
in Constantius, who succeeded his fa- 
ther in the East. They underwent va- 
rious revolutions and persecutions un- 
der succeeding emperors ; till, at length, 
Theodosius the Great exerted eveiy 
effort to suppress them. Their doc- 
trine was carried, in the fifth century, 
into Africa, under tiie Vandals ; and 
into Asia under the Goths. — Italy, Gaul, 
and Spain, were also deeply infected 
with it ; and towards the commence- 
ment of the sixth century, it was tri- 
umphant in many parts of Asia, Africa, 
and Europe ; but it sunk almost at once, 
when the Vandals were driven out of 
Africa, and the Goths out of Italy, by 
the arms of Justinian. However, it re- 
^•ived again in Italy, under the protec- 
tion of the Lombards, in the seventh 
century, and was not extinguished till 
about the end of the eighth. Arianism 
was again revived in the West by Ser- 
•\etus, in 1531, for which he suffered 
death. After this the doctrine got 
footing in Geneva, and in Poland ; but 
at length degenerated in a great mea- 
sure into Socinianism. Erasmus, it is 
thought, aimed at reviving it, in his 
conimentaries on the New Testament:

and the learned Grotius seems to lean [ 
that way. Mr. Whiston was one of the 
first divines who revived this controver- 
sy in the eighteenth century. He was 
followed by Ur. Clarke, who was chiefly 
opposed by Dr. Waterland. Those who 
iiold the doctrine which is usually called 
Z,oi!} Onanism, say that Christ pre-ex- 
isted ; but not as the eternal Logos of 
the Father, or as the being by whom 
he made tlie worlds, and had inter- 
course with the patriarchs, or as having 
any certain rank or employment v/hat- 
ever in the divine dispensations. In 
modern times, the tei-m Arian is indis- j 
criminately applied to those who con- j 
sider Jesus smiply subordinate to the i 
Father. Some of' them believe Christ i 
to have been the creator of the world ; 
but they all maintain that he existed 
)re~\iously to his incarnation, though in 
lis pre-existent state they assign him 
different degrees of dignity. Hence the 
terms High and Loiv Arian. See Pre- 
KxiSTENCE. Some of the more recent 
vindicators of Arianism have been H. 
Taylor, in his Apology of Ben Mordecai 
to /lis Fritmdfi for embracing Christian- 
ity ; Dr. Harivood, in his Five Disser- 
tations ; Dr. Price, in his Ser?/wns on 
the Christian Doctrine. See also the 
4th. vol. of the Theological Repository,

^re-existence of Christ.

ARISTOTELIANS, the followers of 
Aristotle. The)^ believed in the eternity 
of the world, and represented the Deitj' 
as somewhat similar to a principle of 
power .giving motion to a machine ; and 
as happy in the contemplation of him- 
self, but regardless of human affairs. 
They were uncertain as to the immor- 
tality of the soul. — As this was rather 
a philosophical than religious sect, we 
shall not enlarge on it. * 

ARK, or Noah's Ark, a floating 
vessel built by Noah for the presei'\'a- 
tion of his family, and the several spe- 
cies of animals, during the deluge. The 
form of the Ark was an oblong, Avith a 
flat bottom, and a sloped roof, raised to 
a cubit in the middle; it had neither 
sails nor rudder ; nor was it sharp at 
the ends for cutting the water. This 
form was admirably calculated to make 
it lie steady on the water, without roll- 
ing, which might have endangered the 
Ih'es of the animals within. 



? 



The length of this ark was 300 cubits, 
which according to Dr. Arbuthnot's 
calculation, amount to a little more than 
547 feet ; its breadth, 50 cubits, or 91-2 
feet; its height, 30 cubits, or 54-72 feet; 
and its solid contents 2,730-782 solid 
feet, sufficient for a carriage for S 1,062 
ton. It consisted of three stories, each 
of which, abating the thickness of the 
floors, might be about 18 feet high, and 
no doubt Vr-as partitioned into a great 
many rooms or apartments. This Aessel 
was doubtless so contrived, as to admic 
the air and the light on all, though tlie 
particular construction of the wuidow.s 
be not mentioned. 

ARK OF THE COVENANT, a 
small chest or coffer, three feet nine 
inches in length, two feet three inches 
in breadth, and two feet three inches iji 
height, in which were contained the 
golden pot that had manna, Aaron's 
rod, and the tables of the covenant. 
The ark was reposited in the holiest 
place of the tabernacle. It was taken 
by, the Philistines, and detained twenty 
(some say forty) years at Kirjath-jea- 
rim ; but, the people being afflicted with 
emerods on account of it, returned it 
with divers presents. It was afterwards 
placed in the temple. 

The lid or covei'ing of the ark was 
called the propitiatory or 7nercy-seat ; 
over which two figures were placed, 
called cherubims, with expanded wings 
of a peculiar form. Here the Shechi- 
nah rested both in the taliernacle and 
temple in a visible cloud : hence Avere 
issued the Divine oracles by an audible 
voice ; and the high priest appeared 
before tiiis mercy-seat once every year 
on the great day of expiation ; and the 
Jews, whei'ever they worshipped, turn- 
ed their faces towards the place wher^ 
the ark stood. 

In the second temple there was also 
an ark, made of the same shape and 
dimensions with the first, and put in 
the same place, but without any of its 
contents and peculiar honours. It was 
used as a representative of the former 
on the day of expiation, and a reposi- 
tory of the original copy of the holy 
Scriptures, collected by Ezra and the 
men of the great synagogue after the 
captivity ; and, in imitation of this, the^ 
Jews, to this day, have a kind of ark in 
their synagogues, wherein their sacred 
books are kept. 

ARMENIANS, the inhabitants of 
Armenia, w]i(»'.; religion is the Chris- 
tian, of the Euncliian sect; that is, they 
hold but one nature in Jesus Christ. 
See EuTYciiiAK«. They assert also 
I the procession of the Holy Ghost fnpm 



ARM 

the Father only. They believe that 
Christ at his descent into hell freed the 
souls of the damned from thence, and 
reprieved them to the end of the world, 
when tliev shall be remanded to eternal 
flames. They believe that the souls of 
the righteous shall not be admitted to 
the beatific vision till after the resur- 
rection, notwithstanding which they 
pray to departed saints, adore tlieir 
pictures, ana bui-n lamps before them. 
The Armenian clergy consist of patri- 
archs, archbishops, doctors, secular 
priests, and monks. The Armenian 
monks are of the order of St. Basil ; and 
every Wednesday and Friday they eat 
neitlier fish, nor eggs, nor oil, nor any 
tKnig made of miik ; and during Leiit 
they live upon nothing but roots. They 
have seven sacraments; baptism, con- 
firmatioUj penance, the eucharist, ex- 
treme unction, orders, and matrimony. 
— They admit infants to the communion 
at two or three months old. They seem 
to place the chief part of their religion 
in fastings and abstinences ; and, among 
the clergy, the higher the degree, flie 
lower they must live ; insomuch that it 
is said the archbishops live on nothing 
but pulse. They consecrate holy water 
but once a year ; at which time every 
one fills a pot, and carries it home, 
which brings hi a considerable revenue 
to the church. 

ARMINIANS, persons who follow 
the doctrines of Arminius, who was pas- 

Jor at Amsterdam, and afterwards pro- 
essor of divinity at Leyden. Ai-mmius 
had been educated in the opinions of 
Calvin ; but, thinking the doctrine of 
that great man with regard to free will, 

i)redestination, and grace, too severe, 
le began to express his doubts concern- 
ing them in the year 1591 ; and, upon 
farther enquiry, adopted th« sentiments 
of those whose" religious system extends 
the love of the Supreme Being and the 
merits of Jesus Christ to all mankind. 
The Arminians are also called Remon- 
strants, because, in 1611, they pre- 
sented a remonstrance to the states- 
general, wherein they state their griev- 
ances, and pray for relief. 

The distinguishing tenets of the Ar- 
minians may be comprised in the five 
following articles relati\'e to predesti- 
nation, universal redemption, the cor- 
ruption of man, conversion, and perse- 
verance, viz. 

I. That God, from all etei-nity, de- 
termined to bestow salvation on those 
who he foresaw would persevere unto 
the end ; and to inflict everlasting pun- 
ishments on those who should continue 
m their unbelief, and resist his divme 



32 



ARM 



succours; so that election was condi- 
tional, and reprobation in like manner 
the result of foreseen iniidelit}' and per- 
severing wickedness. 

II. That Jesus Christ by his suflferings 
and death, made an atonement for the 
sins of all mankind in general, and of 
every individual in particular; that, how- 
ever, none but those who believe in him 
can be partakers of divine benefits. 

III. That true faith cannot proceed 
from the exercise of our natural facul- 
ties and powers, nor from the force and 
operation of free will ; since man, in con- 
sequence of his natural conniption, is 
incapable either of thinking or doing 
any good thing ; and that, therefore, it 
is necessary, in order to his conversion 
and salvation, that he be regenerated 
and renewed by the operation of the 
Holy Ghost, which is the gift of God 
through Jesus Christ. 

IV. That this divine grace, or energy 
of the Hol}^ Ghost, begins and perfects 
e^•ery thing that can be called good in 
man, and, consequently, all good works 
are to be attriliuted to God alone ; that, 
nevertheless, this grace is offered to all, 
and does not force men to act against 
their inclinations, but may be resisted 
and rendered ineffectual by the perverse 
will of the impenitent sinner. Some 
modem Arminians intei"pret this and 
the last article with a greater latitude. 

V. That God gives to tlie truly faith- 
ful who are regenerated Ijy his grace, 
the means of preserving themselves in 
this state. The first Arminians, indeed, 
had some doubt with respect to the 
closing part of this article ; but their 
followers uniformly maintain "that the 
regenerate may lose tnie justifying faith, 
fall from a state of grace, and die in 
their sins." 

After the appointment of Arminius 
to the theological chair at Leyden, he 
thought it his duty to avow and vindi- 
cate the pi'inciples which he had em- 
braced ; and the freedom with which he 
published and defended tliem, exposed 
liim to the resentment of those that ad- 
he»ed to the theological system of Ge- 
neva, which then jirevailed in Holland ; 
but his principal opponent was Gomar, 
his colleague. The controversy which 
was thus begun became more general 
after the death of Arminius in the year 
1609, and threatened to involve the 
United Provinces in civil discord. The 
Arminian tenets gained ground under 
the mild and favourable treatment of 
the magistrates of Holland, and were 
adopted bv several persons of merit and 
distinction". TheCalvinists orGomarists, 
as they were now called, appealed fo a

national sA'nod ; accordingly, the s'lTiod 
of Dort was conA encd, by order or the 
states-general, 1618; and was com- 
posed of ecclesiastic deputies from the 
United ProA'inces as Avell as from the 
reformed churches of England, Hessia, 
Bremen, Switzerland, and the Palati- 
nate. The jnrincipal advocate in favour 
of the Armmians was Episcopius, wlio 
at that time was professor of divhiity at 
Leyden. It was first proposed to dis- 
cuss the principal subjects in dispute, 
that the Arminians should be allowed 
to state and \ indicate the grounds on 
whicli their opinions were founded ; but, 
some difference arising as to the proper 
mode of conducting the debate, tlie Ar- 
minians were excluded from the assem- 
i)Iy, their case was tried in tlieir absence, 
and they were pronounced guilty of 
pestilential en-ors, and condemned as 
coriiipters of the tiiie religion. A cu- 
rious account of the proceedings of tlie 
above synod may be seen in a series of 
letters written Ijy Mr. John Hales, who 
was present on tlie occasion. 

In consequence of tlie above-men- 
tioned decision, the Arminians were 
considered as enemies to their country, 
and its establislied religion, and were 
much persecuted. Tliey were treated 
with great severity, and deprived of all 
their posts and employments; their 
ministers were silenced, and their con- 
gregations were suppressed. The great 
narnevcldt was belieaded on a scaffold ; 
and the learned Grotius, being con- 
demned to perpetual imprisonment, fled, 
and took refuge in France. 

After the death of prince Maurice, 
who had been a violent partizan in fa- 
vour of the Gomarists, in the &gt; ear 1625, 
the AiTninian exiles were restored to 
their former reputation and tranquillity ; 
and, under the toleration of the state, 
they erected churches and founded a 
college at Amsterdam, appointing Epis- 
copius the first theological professor. 
The Arminian system has very much 
prevailed in England since the time of 
Archbishop Laud, and its votaries in 
other countries are vei-j^ numerous. It 
is generally supposed that a majority 
of tlie clergy in both the established 
churches of Great Britain favour the 
Arminian system, notwithstanding their 
articles are strictly Calvinistic. The i 
name of Mr. John \Vesley hardly need 
be mentioned here. Every one knows 
what an advocate he was for the tenets 
of Arminius, and the success he met 
with. See Methodists. 

Some of the principal writers on the 
side of the Armmians have been Annini- 
us,. Episcopius, Vorstius, Grotius, Cur- 



cellxiis, Limborch, Le Clerc, Wetstein, 
Goockuin, JVhitby, T'aylor, Fletcher, ?&lt;.c. 

Some of the principal wi-itei's on the 
other side have oeen Polhill in his Book 
on the Decrees ; John Edwards in his 
Feiitas Redux ; C'o/einhis Sovereignty 
of God; Edwards on the Will, and 
Original Sin ; Dr. Owen in his Disfilaxj 
of Arminianism, and on particular Re- 
demption ; Gill in his Cause of God 
and Truth; and Toplady, in almost all 
his works. 

ARNOLDISTS, the followers of 
Arnold, of Brescia, in the twelfth cen- 
tury, who Avas a great declaimer against 
the wealth and vices of the clergy. He 
is also charged v/ith preaching against 
baptism and the eucharist. He was 
burnt at Rome in 1155, and his ashes 
cast into the Tiber. 

ARl EMONTES, a denomination in 
the second century ; so called from Ar- 
temon, who taught that, at the birth of 
the man Christ, a certain divine energy-, 
or portion of the divine nature, united 
itself to him. 

ARTICLE OF FAITH is, by some, 
defined a point of Christian doctrine, 
which we are obliged to believe, as 
having been revealed by God himself, 
and allowed and established as such by 
the church. See Coxfessions. 

ARTICLES OF THE CHURCH 
OF ENGLAND. See Church of 

EXGI.AND. 

ARTICLES, LAMBETH. The 

Lambeth articles were so called, be- 
cause drawn up at Lambeth palace, 
under the eye and with the assistance 
of archbishop Whitgift, bishop Bancroft, 
Inshop Vaughan, and other eminent dig- 
nitaries of the Church. That the 
reader may judge how Calvinistic the 
clergy were under the reign cf queen 
Elizabeth, we shall here insert them. 
"1. God hath from eternity predesti- 
nated certain persons to life, and hath 
reprobated certain persons unto death. 
2. The moving or efficient cause of 
predestination unto life is not the fore- 
sight of faith, or of persevei-ance, or of 
good works, or of any thing that is in 
the persons predestinated ; but the alone 
will of God's good pleasure. 3. The 
predestinati are a pre-determined and 
certain number which can neither be 
lessened nor increased. 4. Such as are 
not predestmated to salvation shall in- 
evitably be condemned on account of 
their sins. 5. The true, lively, and jus- 
tifying faith, and the Spirit o\ God jus- 
tifying, is not extinguished, doth not ut- 
terly "fail, doth not vanish away in the 
elect, either finally or totally. 6. A 
tnae believer, that is, one who is endued

ASS 



-with justifying faith, is certified b)' the 
full assurance of faith that his sins are 
forgiven, and that he shall be everlast- 
ingly saved by Christ. 7. Saving grace 
is" not allowed, is not imparted, is not 
granted to all men, by which they may 
be saved, if they will. 8. No man is 
able to come to Christ, unless it be given 
him; and unless the Father draw him; 
and all men are not drawn by the Fa- 
ther, that they may come to his Son. 
9. It is not m the will or power of every 
man to be saved." What gave occasion 
to the framing these articles was this : 
—Some persons had distinguished them- 
selves at the university of Cambridge 
by opposing predestination. Alarmed at 
the opinions that were vented, the above- 
mentioned archbishop), with others, com- 
Eosed these articles, to prevent the 
elief of a contrary doctrme. These, 
when completed, were sent down to 
Cambridge, to which the scholars were 
strictlv enioincd to conform. 

ARTqtYRITES, a Christian sect 
in the primiti\ e church, who celebrated 
the eucharist with bi-ead and cheese. 
The word is derived from aoti;, "bread," 
and Tu^cc, "cheese." The Artotyrites 
admitted women, to the priesthood and 
episcopacy; and Epiphanius tells us 
that it was a common thing to see seven 
girls at once enter into their church 
robed in white, and holding a torch in 
their hands; where they wept and be- 
wailed the wretchedness of liiunan na- 
ture, and the miseries of this life. 

ASCENSION OF CHRIST, his vi- 
sible elevation to heaAcn. The ascen- 
sion of Jesus Christ was not only pre- 
signified by many Scripture types, but 
also by many remarkable Scripture pro- 
phecies. Ps. xlvii. 5. Ps. ex. 1. Dan. vii. 
13, 14. Mic. ii. 13. Ps.lxviii. 18. 

The trvidenccs of his ascension nvere 
numerous. The disciples saw him as- 
cend, Acts i. 9, 10. Two angels testified 
that he did ascend, Acts i. 11. Stephen, 
Paul, and John saw him in his ascended 
state, Acts vii. 55, 56. Acts ix. Rev. i. 
The marvellous descent of the Holy 
Ghost demonstrated it, John xvi. 7. l-i. 
Acts ii. 33. The terrible overtlirow and 
dispersion of the Jewish . nation is a 
standing proof of it, John viii. 21. Matt, 
xxvi. 64. 

The time of his ascension. It was 
forty days after his resurrection. He 
continued so many days on earth, that 
he might give many repeated proofs of 
his resurrection, Acts i. 3; that he 
might instruct his followers in evei-y 
thing wliich pertained to the abolish- 
ment of the Jewish ceremonies, Acts 
i. 3; and that he might open to tliem 



the Scriptures concerning himself, and 
renew their commission to preach the 
Gospel, Acts i. 5, 6. Mark xvi. 15. 

7 he manner of his ascension: It was 
from Mount Ohvet to heaven, Acts i. 
12; not in appearance only, but in 
reality and tiaith; visibly and locally; 
a real motion of his human nature; 
sudden, swift, glorious, and in a tri- 
umphant mannei'. He was parted from 
his disciples while he was solemnly 
blessing them ; and multitudes of angels 
attended him with shouts of praise, Ps 
Ixviii. 17. xlvii. 5, 6. 

The effects or ends of Christ^ s ascen 
sion ivere, 1. To fulfil the prophecies 
and types concerning it. 2. To take 
upon hmi more cpenlv the exercise of 
his kingly office. 3. To receive gifts 
for men both ordinary and extraordhia- 
ry, Ps. Ixviii. 18. 4. To open the way 
into heaven for his people, Heb. x-. 19, 
20. ■ 5. To assure the saints of their as- 
cension also, John xiv. 1, 2. 

ASCETIC, one who retires from the 
world for the pui^pose of devotion and 
mortification. When the monks came 
in fashion, this title was l)estowed upon 
them, especially such as lived in soli- 
tude. It was also the title of several 
books of spiritual exercises, as the 
Ascetics, or devout exercises of St. 
Basil, 8vc. 

ASCODROGITES, a denomination 
which arose about the year 181. They 
brought into their churches bags or 
skins filled Avith new wine, to represent 
the new bottles filled with new wine, 
mentioned by Christ. They danced 
round these bags or skins, and, it is said, 
intoxicated themselves with the wine. 

ASCOODRUTES, a sect, in the se- 
cond century, Avho rejected the use of 
all symbols and sacraments on this prin- 
ciple, that incorporeal things cannot be 
communicated by things corporeal, nor 
divine mysteries bv anv thing visible. 

ASSEMBLIESOF THE CLERGY 
are called con\'ocations, synods, coun- 
cils. I'he annual meeting of the church 
of Scotland is called a general assembly. 
In this assembly his majesty is repre- 
sented by his commissioners, who dis- 
solves one meeting and calls another in 
the name of the king, while the mode- 
I'ator does the same in the name of Je- 
sus Christ. See Convocation, Pres- 
byterians. 

ASSENT, that act of the mind where- 
by it takes or acknowledges any pi-opo- 
sition to be true or false. There are 
three degrees of assetit: — conjecture, 
ofiinion, and belief. Conjecture is but a 
slight and weak inclination to assent to 
the thing proposed, by reason of the 



ASS

weightj' objections that lie against it. 
Opinion is a more steady and fixed as- 
sent, when a man is almost certam, 
though yet some fear of the contrar}' 
i-emains with liim. Belief is a more 
full and assured assent to the tiiith. 
See Belief. 

ASSURANCE is the firm persuasion 
we haA-e of the certainty of any thing, 
or a certain expectation of something 
future. 

Assurance of the UnderRtandint; is 
a well-grounded knowledge of divine 
things founded on God's word. Col. ii. 2. 
— Assurance of Faith does not relate to 
our personal interest in Christ, but con- 
sists in a firm belief of the revelation 
that God has given us of Christ in his 
word, with an entire dependence on him. 
1 leb. X. 22. — Assurayice of Hope is a 
firm expectation that God will grant us 
the complete enjoyment of Avhat he has 
promised. Heb. vi. 11. 

The doctrine of assurance, i. e. the 
belief that we have an interest in the 
divine favour, has afforded matter for 
dispute among divines. Some have as- 
serted that it IS not to be obtained in the 
g resent state, allowing that persons may 
e in a hopeful way to sah'ation, but that 
they have no real or absolute assurance 
of it : but this is clearly refuted by facts 
as well as by Scri])tui-e. That it is to 
be obtained is evident, for we ha^e 
reason to believe many persons have ac- 
tually obtamed it. Job xix. 25. Ps. xvii. 
15. 2 Tim. i. 12. The Scriptures ex- 
hoit us to obtain it, 2 Cor. xiii. 5. Heb. 
vi. 11. 1 Thess. v. 21. The Holy Spirit 
is said to bear witness of it, Rom. viii. 16. 
The exercise of the Christian graces i-s 
considered as a proof of it, 1 John iii. 
14. 1 John ii. 3. We must, however, 
guard against presumption ; for a mere 
persuasion that Christ is ours is no proof 
that he is so. We must have evidence 
befoi-e we can have genuine assurance. 
It is necessary to observe also, that it 
is not a duty imposed upon all man- 
kind, so that ever)' one, m whatsoc\er 
state he may be, ought to be fully 
persuaded of his salvation. "We do 
not affirm," says Saurin, "that Chris- 
tians of whose sincerity there may be 
some doubt have a rigiit to assurance ; 
that backsliders, as s\ich, ought to per- 
suade themselves that they shall be 
saved; nor do we say that Christians 
v/ho have arrived to the highest degree 
of holiness, can be persuaded of the 
certainty of their salvation in every 
period of their lives ; nor, if left to their 
own efforts can they enjoy it ; but be- 
lievers, supported by the Divhie aid, 
who walk m all good conscience before 



him, these only have ground to expect 
this privilege." 

Some divines have maintained that 
assurance is included in the very essence 
of faith, so that a man cannot have faith 
without assurance ; but we must distin- 
I guish between assurance and justifying 
j faith. . The apostle, indeed, speaks of 
I the full assurance of faith ; but then this 
is a full and firai persuasion of what the 
Gospel reveals; whereas the assui-ancc 
we are speaking of relates to our per- 
sonal interest in Christ, and is an effect 
of tliis faith, and not faith itself. Faith 
in Christ certainly includes some idea 
of assurance ; for, except we be assured 
that he is the Saviour, Ave shall never 
go to or rely upon him as such; but 
faith in Christ does not imply an assu- 
rance of our interest in him ; for there 
may be faith long before the assurance 
of personal interest commences. The 
confounding of these ideas has been the 
cause of presumption on the one hand, 
and despair on the other. W^hen men 
have been taught that faitli consists in 
believing that Christ died for them, and 
been assured that, if they can only be- 
lieve so, all is well ; and that then they 
are immediately pardoned and justified, 
the consequence has been, that the bold 
and self-conceited have soon wrought 
thcmseh'es up to such a persuasion, 
without ail)' ground for it, to their own 
deception ; whilst the dejected, humble, 
and poor in spirit, not being able to 
Avork themselves to such a pitch of 
confidence, have concluded that they 
ha\-e not the faith of God's elect, and 
must inevitably be lost. 

The means to attain assurance are 
not those of an extraordinary kind, as 
some people imagine ; such as visions, 
dreams, voices, &amp;c.; but such as are 
ordinary; self-examination, humble and 
constant prayer, consulting the sacred 
oracles, Christian communication, at- 
tendance on the divine ordinances, and 
perseverance in the path of duty ; with- 
out wliich all our assurance is but pre- 
sumption, and our profession but hy- 
pocrisy. 

Assurance may be lost for a season 
through bodily diseases which depress 
the spirits, unwatchfulness, falling into 
sin, manifold temptations, worldly cares, 
and neglect of private duty. Hej there- 
fore, who vvouid wish tp enjoy this pri- 
vilege, let him cultivate comnmnion with 
God, exercise a watchful spirit against 
his spiritual enemies, and give himself 
unreservedly to Him whose he is, and 
whom he professes to sei've. See Sau-

ASTONISHMENT, a kmd or de- 
cree of wonder introduced by surprise. 
This emotion always relates to things 
of the highest importance; to things 
which appear too vast and extensive 
for the grasp of intellect, rather than 
to any thing of an uitricate natui-e. The 
body marks in a striking manner the 
singular state of the mind under this 
emotion. The eyes are firmly fixed, 
without being directed to any particular 
object; the character of countenance, 
■which was formed by the habitual in- 
fluence of some predominant allection, 
is for a time effaced; and a suspension 
of every other expression, a certain 
vacuity, strongly notes this state of 
mind. 

ATHANASIANS, those who profess 
the sentiments held in the Athanasian 
Creed. See Creed. 

ATHEIST, one v/ho denies the ex- 
istence of God: — tliis is called specula- 
tive atheism. Professing to believe in 
God, and yet acting contraiy to this 
belief, is called practical atheism. Ab- 
surd and irrational as atheism is, it has 
had its votaries and martyrs. In the 
seventeenth centuiy, Spinosa, a fo- 
reigner, was its noted defender. Lucilio 
Vanini, a native of Naples, also pub- 
licly taught atheism m France; and, 
being convicted of it at Toulouse, was 
condemned and executed in 1619. It 
has been questioned, however, whether 
any man ever seriously adopted such a 

ijrmciple. The pretensions to it have 
)een generally founded on pride or af- 
fectation. The open avowal of atheism 
by several of the leading members of 
the French convention seems to have 
been an extraordinaiy moral pheno- 
menon. This, however, as we have 
seen, was too vague and uncomfortable 
a principle to last long. Archbishop Til- 
lotson justly observes, that specvdative 
atheism is unreasonable upon five ac- 
counts. 1. Because it gives no tolerable 
account of the -existence of the world. 
— 2. It does not irive any reasonable ac- 
count of the universal consent of man- 
kind in this apprehension, that there is 
a God. — 3. It requires more evidence 
for things than they are capalile of 
giving. — 4. The atheist pretends to 
know tliat which no man can know. — 



5. Atheism contradicts itself. Under 

the first of these he thus argues ."I 

appeal to any man of reason whether 
any thing can be more unreasonable 
than obstinately to impute an effect to 
chance, which carries in the very face 
of it all the arguments and characters 
of a wise design and contrivance. Was 
ever any considerable work, in whicli 
there was required a great variety of 
parts, and a regular and orderly dispo- 
sition of those parts, done by chance? 
Will chance fit means to ends, and that 
in ten thousand instances, and not fail 
in any one? How often might a man, 
after'he had jumbled a set of letters in 
a bag, fling them out upon the ground, 
before they would fall into an exact 
poem; yea, or so much as make a good 
ciiscourse in prose? And may not a 
little book be as easily made b)- cliance 
as the great volume of the world? How 
long might a man be in sprinkling co- 
lours upon canvass with a cureless hand, 
before they would happen to make the 
exact picture of a man? And is a man 
easier made by chance than his picture ? 
How long might twenty thousand blind 
men, who should be sent out from seve- 
ral 'ren\ote paits of England, wander 
up and down before they would all meet 
upon Salisbury plain, and fall into rank 
and file in the exact order of an army? 
And, yet, this is much moie easy to be 
inuiglned tlian how the innumerable 
blind parts of matter should rendezvous 
themselves into a world. A man that 
sees Henry the Seventh's chapel at 
Wcstmiiister might with as good reason 
maintain (yea, with much better, con- 
sidering tlie vast difference betwixt that 
little structure and the huge fabric of 
the world) that it Avas ne\er contrived 
or built by any means, but that the 
stones did by chance grow into tliose 
curious figures into whicli they seem 
to have been cut and graven ; and that 
upon a time (as tales usually begin) the 
materials of that building, the stone, 
mortar, timber, iron, lead, and glass, 
happily met together, and \ery fortu- 
nately ranged themselves in.to that de- 
licate" order in which v.e see them now, 
so close compacted, that it must be a 
very great chance that parts them again. 
What would the world think of a man 
that should ad\'ance such an opinion as 
this, and write a book for it ? If they 
would do him right, they o'.iglit to look 
upon him as mad ; but yet with a little 
more reason than any man can have to 
say, that the world was made by chance, 
or that the first men grew up out of the 
earth as plants do now. For, can any 
thing be more I'idiculous, and against

all reason, than to ascribe the pi'oduc- 
tiou of men to the first fruitfulness of 
the earth, without so much as one in- 
stance and experiment, in any age or 
history, to countenance so monstrous a 
supposition ? The thing is, at first sight, 
so gi-oss and palpable, that no discourse 
about it can make it more apparent. 
And yet, these shameful beggars of prin- 
ciples give this precarious account of 
the original of thmgs; assume to them- 
selves to be the men of reason, the 
great wits of the world, the only cau- 
tious and wary persons that hate to be 
imposed upon, tnat must have convinc- 
ing evidence for every thing, and can 
admit of nothing without a clear de- 
monsti-ation of it." See Existence of 
God. 

Some of the principal writers on the 
existence of a Deity ha^e been A'nvton, 
Boyle, Cheyne, Locke, Aneiiiventyt,

ATONEMENT is the satisfying Di- 
vine Justice by Jesus Christ giving him- 
self a ransom for us, undergoing the 
penalty due to our sins, and thereby re- 
leasing us from that punishment wliich 
God might justly inflict upon us, Rom. 
v. 11. The Hebrew word signifies co- 
veii?ig, and intimates that our offences 
are, by a proper atonement, covered 
from the avenging justice of God. In or- 
der to understand the manner wherein 
Cl\rist becomes an atonement, "we 
should," says Dr. Watts, " consider the 
following propositions, 1. The great God 
ha\ ing made man, appointed to govern 
liim by a wise and righteous law, where- 
in glory and honour, life and immortali- 
ty, are the designed rewards for perfect 
obedience; but tribulation and wrath, 
pain and death, are the appointed re- 
compense to those who violate this law. 
Gen. iii. Rom. ii. 6, 16. Rom. i. 32. — 2 
All mankind have broken this law, 
Rom. iii. 23. Rom. v. 12. — 3. God, in his 
infinite wisdom, did not think fit to par- 
don sinful man, without some compen- 
sation for liis broken law; for, 1. If the 
great Ruler of the world had pardoned 
the sins of men without any satisfaction, 
then his laws might have seemed not 
worth the vindicating. — 2. Men would 
have been tempted to persist in tiiie re- 
bellion, and to repeat their old oifences. 
— 3. His forms of government among 
his creatures might have appeared as 
^. matter of small importance. — i. God 



had a mind to make a veiy illustrious 
display both of his justice and of his 
grace among mankmd; on these ac- 
counts he would not pardon sin witliout 
a satisfaction. — 5. Man, sinful man, is 
not able to make any satisfaction to God 
for his own sins, neither by his labours, 
nor by his sufferings, Epli. ii. 1, 8, 9. — 
6. Though man be incapable to satisfy 
for his own violation of the law, yet God 
would not suffer all mankind to perish. 
— 7. Because God intended to make a 
full display of the terrors of his justice, 
and his divine resentment for the viola- 
tion of his law, therefore he appointed 
his own Son to satisfy for the breach of 
it, by becoming a proper sacrifice of 
expiation or atonement. Gal. iii. 10, 13. 
— 8. The Son of God being immortal, 
could not sustain all tliese penalties of 
the law which man had brolcen, without 
taking the mortal nature of man upon 
him, without assuming fiesh and blood, 
Heb. ii. 13, 14.— 9. The Divine Being 
having received such ample satisfaction 
for sin by the sufferings of his own Son, 
can honourably forgive his creature 
man, who was the transgressor, Rom. 
iii. 25, 26. jYonv that this doctrine is 
true, will a/i/iear, if ive consider, 1. 
That an atonement for sin, or an ef- 
fectual method to answer the demands 
of an offended God, is the first great 
blessing guilty man stood in need of, 
Mic. vi. 6, 7.-2. The very first disco- 
veries of grace which were made to 
man after his fall implied in them some- 
thing of an atonement for sin, and point- 
ed to the propitiation Christ iias noA\' 
made, Gen. iii. 15. — 3. The train of ce- 
remonies which were appointed by God 
in the Jewish church are plain significa- 
tions of such an atonement, 2 Cor. iii. 
Col. ii. 7, 8, 9. Hel). x. — 4. Some of the 
prophecies confinn and ejcplain the first 
pi'omise, and show that Christ was to 
die as an atoning sacrifice for the sins 
of men, Dan. ix. 24 — 26. Is. hii. — 5. Our 
Saviour himself taught us the doctrine 
of the atonement for sin by liis death, 
Matt. XX. 28. John vi. 51. Luke xxii. 
19. — 6. The terrors of soul, the con- 
sternation and inward agonies whicli 
our blessed Lord sustained a little be- 
fore his death, were a sufficient proof 
that he endured punishments in liis soul 
which were due to sin, Mark x'n'- 33. 
Heb. V. 7.-7. This doctrine is declared, 
and confirmed, and explained at large, 
by the apostles in their writings, 1 Cor. 
XV. 3. Eph. i. 7. 1 John ii. 2, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
— 8. This was the doctrine that was 
witnessed to the world by the amazing 
gifts of the Holv Ghost, which attended 
the Gospel. [See the Acts of the Apos- 



ATT

ties.] The inferences and uses to be de- 
rived from this doctrine are these: 1. 
How vain are all the labours and pre- 
tences of mankind to seek or hope for 
any better religion than that which is 
contained in the Gospel of Christ. It 
is here alone that we can find the solid 
and rational principle of reconciliation to 
an offended God, Heb. iv. 14. — 2. How 
strange and unreasonable is the doctrine 
of the Popish church, who, while they 
profess to believe the religion of Christ, 
yet introduce many other methods of 
atonement for sin, besides the sufferings 
of the Son of God. [See above.] — 3. 
Here is a solid foundation, on which the 
greatest of sinners may hope for accept- 
ance with God, 1 Tim. i. 15. — 4. This 
doctrine should be used as a powerful 
motive to excite repentance. Acts v. 
31. — 5. We should use this atonement 
of Christ as our constant way of access 
to God in all our prayers, Heb. x. 19, 
22. — 6. Also as a divine guard against 
sin, Rom. vi. 1, 2. 1 Pet. i. 15, 19. — 7. 
As an argument of prex'ailing force to 
be used in prayer, Rom. viii. 32. — S. As 
a spring of love to God, and to his Son 
Jesus Christ, 1 John iv. 10. — 9. As a 
stroiig persuasive to that love and pity 
which we should sho\v on all occasions 
to our fellow creatures, 1 John iv. 11. — 
10. It should excite patience and holy 
joy under afflictions and earthly sor- 
i-ows, Rom. v. 1 to 3. — 11. 'V\'e should 
consider it as an invitation to the Lord's 
supper, where Christ is set forth to us 
in the memorials of his propitiation. — 
12. As a most effectual defence against 
the terrors of d)"ing, and as our jovful 
hope of a blessed resurrection, 1 Cor. 
XV. 50. — 13. Lastl)% as a divine allui'e- 
inent to the upper world." See IVatt's 
Ser7nons, scr. 34, 35, 36, 37"; F.vans on 
the Atonement ; Dr. Owen on the 
Satisfaction of Christ; JTest's Scri/2-

ATTRIBUTES OF GOD are the 
several qualities or perfections of the 
Divine nature. Some distinguish them 
into the negative, and positi\'e or affir- 
mative. Tiie negative are such as re- 
move from *him whatever is imperfect 
in creatures: such are mfinity, immuta- 
bility, immortality, 6cc. The positive j 
are such as assert some perfection in 
God which is in and of himself, and 
vhich in the creatures, in any measure, 
is from him. This distinction is now 
mostly discarded. Some distinguish 
them mto absolute and relati\e: abso- 
lute ones are such as agree with the 



essence of God ; as Jehovah, Jah, 8cc. : 
relative ones are such as agree with 
him in time, v.ith some respect to his 
creatures, as Creator, Governor, Pre- 
server, Redeemer, &amp;c. But the more 
commonly received distinction of the 
attributes of God, is into commmiicabla 
and incommunicable ones. The com- 
municaljle ones are those of which there 
is some resemblance in men; as good- 
ness, holiness, wisdom, &amp;c. : the mcom- 
municaljle ones are such as there is no 
appearance or shadow of in men; as 
independence, immutability, immensity, 
and eternity. See those diflferent arti- 
cles in this work; and Bates, Chamock, 
Abernethy, and Saurin on the Divine 
Peifcctions. 

ATTRITION. The casuists of the 
church of Rome have made a distinc- 
tion between a peifect and an imperfect 
cofitrition. The latter they call attri- 
tion ; which is the lowest degree of I'e- 
pentancc, or a sorrow for sin arising 
irojii a sense of shame, or any temporal 
inconvenience attending the commission 
of it, or merely from fear of the punish- 
ment due to it, without any resolution to 
sin no moi-e : in consequence of which 
doctrine, they teach that, after a wick- 
ed and flagitious course of life, a man 
may be reconciled to God, and his sins 
forgiven on his death-bed, by confessing 
them to the priest with this imperfect 
degree of sorrow and repentance. This 
distinction was settled by the council of 
Trent. It might, however, be easily 
shown that the mere sorrow for sin be- 
cause of its consequences, and not on 
account of its evil nature, is no more 
acceptable to God than hypocrisy itself 
can be. 

AVARICE is an immoderate love to 
and desire after riches, attended with 
exti-eme diffidence of future events, 
making a person rob himself of the ne- 
cessary comforts of life, for fear of di- 
minishing his riches. See Covetous- 
NESS and Miser. 

AVERSION, hatred or dislike.— Dr. 
Watts and others oppose aversion to 
desire. When we look, say they, upon 
an object as good, it excites desire; but 
when we look upon an object as evil, 
it a^vakens what we call aversion oj- 
avoidance. But I^ord Kaims ol)sen"es 
that aversion is opposed to afTection, 
and not to desire. v\'e have an affec- 
tion to one person; we have "an aver- 
sion to another: the former disjioses us 
to do good, the latter to do ill.

A'UGSBURGH or AUGUSTAN, 
CONFESSION, a celebrated confes- 
sion of faith drawn up by Luthei* and 
Melancthon on behalf of themselves and 
other ancient reformers, and presented 
in 1550 to the emperor Charles Y. at 
the diet of Augiista, or Augsburgh, in 
the name of the evangelic bod)'. This 
confession contains twenty-eight chap- 
ters, of which the greatest part is em- 
ployed in representing with perspicuity 
and truth the religious opinions of the 
Protestants, and the rest in pointing out 
the errors and abuses that occasioned 
their separation from the churcli of 
Rome. The leading doctrines of this 
confession are, the true and essential 
divinity of the Son of God ; his substi- 
tution, and vicarious sacrifice ; and the 
necessity, freedom, and efficacy of Di- 
\inc grace. A civil war foUov.'ed this 
diet that lasted upwards of twenty 
years, but v/liich only spread the new 
opinions, instead of extirpating them. 



AUGUSTINS, a religious order, who 
observed the laile of St. Augustin, pre- 
scribed them by pope Alexander IV. 
in 1256. This rule was to have all 
things in common ; the rich who enter 
among them to sell their possessions, 
and give them to the poor; to employ 
the first part of the morning in labour- 
ing with their hands, and the rest iu 
reading: when they go abroad, to go 
always two in company ; never to eat 
but in their monastery, &amp;c. 

AUSTERITY, a state of rig;id mor- 
tification. It is distinguished from se- 
verity and rigour thus: Austerity relates 
to the manner of living; severity to the 
manner of thinking; rigour to the man- 
ner of pimishing. To austerity is op- 
posed eff'eminacy; to severity, relaxa- 
tion; to rigour, ' clemency A hermit 
is austere in his life ; a casuist severe 
in his application of religion or law; a 
judge rigorous in his sentences.

BACKBITING. See Detraction 
and Slander. 

BACKSLIDING, the act of turning 
from the path of duty. It m.ay be con- 
sidered as jiartial when applied to true 
believers, who do not backslide witli the 
whole bent of their Avill; a.^ voluntary, 
when ap])lied to those who, after pro- 
fessing to know the truth, wilfully turn 
from it, and live in the practice of sin ; 
as ^/?fl/, when the mind is given up to 
judicial hardness, as in the case of Judas. 
Partial backsliding must be distinguish- 
ed from Inipocrisy, as the former may 
exist where there are gracious inten- 
tions on the whole ; but the latter is a 
studied profession of appearing to be 
what we are not. 

The causes of backsliding are — the 
cares of _ the world ; improper con- 
nexions ; inattention to secret or closet 
duties; self-conceit and dependence; 
indulgence; listening to and parleying 
with temptations. A backslidiitg state 
is manifested by indifference to prayer 
and self-examination ; trifling or unpro- 
fitable conversation; neglect of public 
ordinances ; shunning the people of God ; 
associating with the w^orld; thinking 
lightly of ?=- ; neglect of the Bible ; and 
often by gross immorality. The conse- 



quences of this awful state are — ^loss of 
character; loss of comfort; loss of use- 
fulness ; and, as long as any remain in 
this state, a loss of a. well-grounded hope 
of future happiness. To avoid this state, 
or recover from it, we should beware of 
the first appearance of sin; be much 
in prayer; attend the ordinances; and 
unite with the ])eople of God. . We 
should consider the awful instances of 
apostacy, as Saul, Judas, Demas, 6cc. ; 
the many warnings we have of it. Matt, 
xxiv. 13. Heb. x. 33. Luke ix. 62.; 
how it grieves the Hoi;,- Spirit ; and how 
wretched it makes us ; above all things, 
our dependence should be on God, that 
we may always be directed by his Spi- 
rit, and kept by his powei\ See Apos- 
tacy. 

BANGORIAN CONTROVERSY, 
so called from Bangor, or the bishoji 
thereof. Bishop Hoadley, the bishop of

and that he had not delegated his pow- 
er, like temporal lawgivers, during their 
absence from their kingdom, to any 
persons, as hi.s vicegerents or deputies.

trary to temporal and spiritual tyranny, 
and in behalf of the civil and religious 
liberties of mankind: upon which he 
was violently opposed, accused, and per-

BANIANS, a religious sect in the 
empire of the Mogul, who believe a 
Metempsychosis; and will therefore eat

animals, but endeavour to release them

Banian is sometimes extended to all the 
idolaters of India, as contradistinguished 
from the Mahometans. 

BAPTISM, the ceremony of washing, 
or the application of water to a person, 
in the name of the Father, the Son, 
and the Holy Ghost, by which he is 
initiated into the visible church. Bap- 
tism exhibits to us the blessings of 
pardon, salvation through Jesus Christ, 
union to and communion witli him, the 
out-pouring of tlie Spirit, regeneration, 
and sanctihcation. Irom baptism re- 
sults the obligation of repentance, love 
to Christ, and perpetual devotedness to 
his praise. Baptism dees not constitute 
a A'isible subject, but only recognizes 
one. Ministers only have a right to ad- 
minister it; and liave a negative voice 
in opposition to all claims. It is an or- 
dinance binding on all who have been 
gi\'en up to God in it ; and to be per- 
petuated to the end of the world. It is 
not, however, essential to salvation ; for 
mere participation of sacraments can- 
not qualify men for heaven: many have 
I'cal grace, consequently in a salvable 
state, before they were baptized: be- 
sides, to suppose it essential, is to put it 
in the place of that which it signihes. 

Baptism has been supposed by many 
learned persons to have had its origin 
from the Jewish church ; in which, they 
maintain, it was the practice, long be- 
fore Clirist's time, to baptize proselytes 
or converts to their faith, as part of the 
ceremony of their admission. "It is 
strange to me," says Dr. Doddridge, 
"that any should doubt of this, when it 
is plain, from express passages in the 
Jewish law, that no Jew who had lived 
like a Gentile for one day could be re- 
stored to the communion" of this church 
without it. Compare Num. xix. 19 and 
20. and many other precepts relating to 
ceremonial pollutions, in which may be 
seen, that the Jews were rendered in- 



capable of appearing before God in the 
tabernacle or temple, till tliey were 
washed either by bathing or sprinking;." 
Others, however, insist, that the Jewish 
proselyte baptism is not by far so an- 
cient; and that John the Baptist was 
the first admmistrator of baptism among 
the Jews. 

The baptism of John, and that of our 
Saviour and his apostles, have been sup- 
posed to be the same; because they 
agree, it is said, in their subjects, form, 
and end. But it must be observed, that 
though there be an agreement in some 
particulars, yet there is not in all. The 
immediate institutor of John's baptism 
was God the Father, John i. 33; but 
the immediate institutor of the Chris- 
tian baptism was Christ, Matt, xxviii. 
19. John's baptism was a /ireparatory 
rite, referring the subjects to Christ, 
who was about to confer on them spi- 
ritual blessings. Matt. iii. 11. John's 
baptism was confined to the Jews; but 
the Cliristian was common to Jews and 
Gentiles, Matt. iii. 5, 7. Matt, xxviii. 
19. It docs not appear that John had 
any formula of administration ; l3ut tlic 
Christian baptism has, viz. "In the 
name," &amp;c. The baptism of John was 
the concluding scene of the legal dis- 
pensation, and, in fact, part of it; and 
to be considered as one of those "divers 
washings" among the Jews; for he did 
not attempt to make any alteration in 
the Jewish religion, nor did the persons 
he baptized cease to be members of the 
Jewish church on the account of their 
baptism; but Christian baptism is the 
regular entrance into, and is a part of, 
the evangelical dispensation, Gal. iii. 
27. It does not appear from the in- 
spired narrative (howe\"er probable 
from inferential reasoning) that any 
but John himself was engaged as opera- 
tor in his baptism ; whereas Christ 
himself baptized none ; but his disci- 
ples, by his authority, and in his name, 
John iv. 2. 

Baptism has been the subject of long 
and sharp controversv, both as it re- 
spects the subject and the mode. To 
state all that has been said on both 
sides, would be impossible in a work of 
this kind. An abstract, however, of 
the chief arguments, I think it my duty 
to present to the reader, in order that 
he may judge for himself. 

yls to the subject. 

The ANTIPiEDOBAPTISTS hold 
that believing adults only are proper 
subjects, because Christ's commission 
to baptize appears to them to restrict 
this ordinance to such only as are taught,

or made disciples ; and that conse- 
quently, infants, who cannot be thus 
taught, are to be excluded. It does not 
appear, say they, that the apostles, in 
executing Christ's commission, ever 
baptized any but tliose who were iirst 
instructed in the Christian faith, and 
professed their belief of it. They con- 
tend that infants can receive no benefit 
from it, and are not capable of faith 
and repentance, which ai'e to be con- 
sidered as pre-requisites. 

jis to the 7node. 

They obsene that the meaning of 
the word BaTT;^M signifies immersion, or 
dipping only ; that John ba])tized i?i 
Jordan ; that he chose a place where 
there was much water ;'that Jesus came 
np out of tlie water ; that Philip and 
the eunuch went down both into the 
■vvater. That the terms washing, puri- 
fying, burving in baptism, so often men- 
tioned in b^ci'ipture, alludes to this mode ; 
that immersion only was the ]")ractice 
of the apostles and the first Christians ; 
and that it was only laid aside from the 
love of novelty, and the coldness of our 
climate. These positions, tliey think, 
are so clear from Scripture, and the 
history of the church, that tliey stand 
in need of but little argument to^sup- 
port them. Farther, they also msist 
that all positive Listitutions depend en- 
tirely upon the will and declai-ation of 
the mstitutor, and that, therefore, rea- 
soning by analogy from previo\is abro- 
gated rites, is to be rejected, and the 
express command of Christ I'especting 
baptism ought to be our rule. 

P^EDOBAPTISTS. 

The Pscdobaptists, however, are of a 
different opinion. As to the subject, 
they believe that qualified adults who 
have not been baptized before, are cer- 
tainly proper subjects ; but, then, they 
think also that infants are not to be ex- 
cluded. They believe that, as the 
Abrahamic and tlie Christian covenants 
are the same. Gen. xvii. 7. Heb. viii. 
12; that as children were admitted un- 
der the former ; and that as baptism is 
now a seal, sign, or confirmation of this 
covenant, infants have as great a right 
to it asthe children had a right to the 
seal of circumcision under tlic law. 
Acts ii. 39. Rom. iv. 11. That if chil- 
dren are not to be baptized because 
tliere is no positive command for it, for 
the same reason women should not 
come to the Lord's supper ; we should 
not keep tlie first day of the week, nor 
attend public, worship, for none of these 



are expressly commanded ; that if in- 
fant baptism had been a human inven- 
tion, how would it have been so univer- 
sal in the first 300 years, and yet no 
record left when it was introduced, nor 
any dispute or controversy about it? 
Some bring it to these two ideas: 1. 
That God did constitute in his church 
the membership of infants, and admit- 
ted them to it by a religious ordinance. 
Gen. xvii. Gal. lii. 14, 17.— 2. That this 
riglit of infants to church membership 
WHS never taken away. This being the 
case, infants must be received, because 
God has instituted it ; and since infants 
must l^e received, it must be either 
without baptism or with it; but none 
must be re ceived wdthout baptism, there- 
fore infants must of necessity be bap- 
tized. Hence, it is clear, that, under 
the Gospel, infants are still continued 
exactly in the same relation to God and 
his church, in which, they were origi- 
nally placed under the former dispen- 
sation. 

That infants are to be received into 
the church, and as such baptized, is 
also inferred from the following pas- 
sages of Scripture : Gen. xvii. Is. xliv. 
3. 'Matt. xix. 16. Luke ix. 47, 48. Marie 
ix. 14. Acts ii. 38, 39. Rom. xi. 17, 21- 
1 Cor. vii. 14. 

Tliough there are no express exam- 
ples in the New Testam.ent of Chinst 
and his apostles baptizing infants, yet 
this is no proof that they were excluded. 
Jesus Christ actually blessed little chil- 
dren ; and it would be hard to believe 
that such received his blessing, and yet 
were not to be members of the Gospel 
church. If Christ received them, and 
would have us receive them in his name, 
how can it be reconciled to keep them, 
out of the visible church ;* Besides, if 
children were not to be baptized, it 
would have been expressly forbidden. 
None of the Jews had any apprehension 
of the rejection of infants, which they 
must have had, if infants had been re- 
jected. As whole households were bap- 
tized, it is probable thei'e were childrea 
among them. Fi'om the year 400 to 
1150, no society of men in all that pe- 
riod of 750 years, ever pretended to 
say it was unlawful to baptize infants ; 
and still nearer the time of our Saviour 
there appears to have been scarcely 
any one that so much as advised the 
delay of infant baptism. Irenccus, who 
lived in the second century, 'and was 
well acquainted with Polycaip, who was 
John's disciple, declares expressly tlla1^ 
the church learned from the apostles 
to baptize children. Origen, m the 
third centurv, afBnned that tlie custom 



BAP 



42 BAP 



of baptizing infants was received from 
Christ and his apostles. Cyprian, and 
a council of ministers (held about the 
year 254) no less than sixty-six in num- 
ber, unanimously agreed that children 
might be baptized as soon as they were 
born. Ambrose, who wrote about 274 
years from the apostles, declares that 
the baptism of infants had been the 
practice of the apostles themselves, and 
of the church, till that time. The ca- 
tholic church eveiy where declared, 
says Chrysostom, in the fifth century, 
that infants should be baptized ; and 
Augustin affirmed that he never heard 
nor read of any Christian, catholic, or 
sectarian, but who always held that in- 
fants v.-ere to be baptized. They far- 
ther believe, that there needed no men- 
tion in the New Testament of receiving 
infants into the church, as it had been 
once appointed, and never repealed. 
The dictates of nature, also, in parental 
feelings ; the verdict of reason in favour 
of privileges ; the evidence in favour of 
children being sharers of the seals of 
grace, m common with their parents, 
for the space of 4000 years ; and espe- 
cially the language of prophecy, in re- 
ference to the children of the Gospel 
church, make it \ ery probable that they 
were not to be rejected. So far from 
confining it to adults, it must be remem- 
bered that there is not a single instance 
recorded in the New Testament in 
^which the descendants of Christian 
'parents were baptized in adult years. 

That infants are not proper subjects 
for baptism, because they cannot profess 
faith and repentance, they den}'. This 
objection falls with as much weight 
upon the institution of circumcision as 
infant baptism ; since they are as capa- 
ble, or are us fit subjects for the one as 
the other. It is generally acknowlec'g- 
ed, that, if infants die (and a gi'eat part 
of the human race do die in infancj^) 
they are saved: if this be the case, 
then, why refuse them the sign in in- 
fancy, if they are capable of enjoying 
the thing signified? "Why," says" Dr. 
Owen, " is it the will of God that un- 
believers should not be baptized ? It is 
because, not gi-anting them the grace, 
he will not grant them the sign. If 
God, therefore, denies the sign to the 
infant seed of believers, it must be be- 
cause he denies thfem tlie grace of it ; 
and then all the children of believing 
parents (upon these principles) dyhig 
in their infancy, must, without hope, be 
eternally damned. I do not say that all 
must be so who are not baptized ; but 
all must be so whom God would not 
have baptized." Something is said of 



baptism, it is observed, that cannot 
agree to infants : faith goes before bap- 
tism ; and, as none but adults are capa- 
ble of believuig, so no others are capa- 
ble of baptism ; but it is replied, if in- 
fants must not be baptized because 
something is said of baptism that does 
not agree to infants, Mark xvi. 16. then 
infants must not be saved, because some- 
thing is said of salvation that does not 
agree to infants, Mark xvi. 16. As none 
but adults are capable of believing, so, 
by the argument of the Baptists, none 
but adults are capable of sahation ; for 
he that believeth not shall be damned. 
But Christ, it is said, set an example of 
adult baptism. True; but he was bap- 
tized in honour to John's ministry, and 
to conform himself to what he appoint- 
ed to his followers ; for which last rea- 
son he drank of the sacramental cup : 
but this is rather an argument for the 
Pxdobaptists tlian against them ; since it 
plainly ihows, as Doddridge obsei*\es, 
that baptism may be administered to 
those who are not capable of all the 
purposes for which it was designed ; 
since Jesus Christ, not being a sinner, 
could not be capable of that faith and 
repentance which are said to be neces- 
sary to this ordinance. 

As to the mode. 

They believe that the word Zavr* 
signifies to dip or to plunge ; but that 
the term Bats-Ti^o?, which is only dei-i- 
vative of &amp;x7rra, and consequently must 
be somewhat less in its signification, 
should be invariably used in the New 
Testament to express plunging, is not 
so clear. It is therefore doubted whe- 
ther dipping be the only meaning, and 
whether Christ absolutely enjoined im- 
mersion, and that it is his positive will 
that no other should be used. As the 
word Bi.TrT(^a) is used for the various ab- 
lutions among the Jews, such as sprink- 
ling, pouring, &amp;c. Heb. ix. 10 ; for the 
custom of washing before meals, and 
the washing of household furniture, 
pots, &amp;c.*; it is evident from hence that 
it does not express the manner of doing, 
whether by immersion or affusion, but 
only the thing done ; that is, washing, 
or the application of water in one fomi 
or other. Dr. Owen obsen-es, that it 
no where signifies to di/i, but as denot- 
ing a mode of, and in order to washing 
or cleansing: and, according to others, 
the mode of use is only the ceremonial 
part of a positive institute; just as hi 
the supper of the Loixl, the time of 
the day, the number and posture of 
communicants, the quality and quantity 
of bread and wine, are circumstajices

not accounted essential by any party of 
Christians. As to the Hebrew word 
Tubal, it is considered as a generic 
term ; that its radical, primary, and 
proper meaning is, to tinge, to dye, to 
wet, or the like ; which primary design 
is effected by diffei'ent modes of appli- 
cation. If in baptism also there is an 
expressive emblem of the descending 
iniluence of the Spii-it, pouring must 
be the mode of administration ; for that 
is tlie Scriptural term most commonly 
and properly used for the communica- 
tion of divine influences. There is no 
object whatever in all the New Testa- 
ment so frequently and so explicitly 
signified by baptism as these divine in- 
fluences, Matt. iii. 11. Mark i. 8, 10. 
Luke iii. 16. to 22. John i. 33. Acts i. 
5. Acts ii. 38, 39. Acts viii. 12, 17. Acts 
xi. 15, 16. The term sprinkluig, also, 
is made use of in reference to the act 
of purifying. Is. Iii. 15. Heb. ix. 13, 14. 
Ezck. xxxvi. 25, and therefore cannot 
be inapplicable to baptismal purifica- 
tion. But it is observed that John ba.p- 
tized in Jordan: to this it is replied, 
to infer always a plunging of the whole 
body in water from this word, would, 
in many instances, be false and absurd : 
the same Greek preposition tv is used 
when it is said thev should be baptized 
with fire; while few will assert tliat 
they should be plunged into it. The 
apostle, speaking of Christ, says, he 
came not (ev) by water only, but {tv) by 
water and blood. There the same word 
iv is translated by, and with justice and 
propriety, for we know no good sense 
in which we could say he came in wa- 
ter. It has been remarked, that «» is 
more than a hundred times, in the New 
Testament, rendered "at," and in a 
hundred and fifty others, it is translated 
nuiih. If it be rendered so here, " John 
baptized at Jordan, or with the water of 
Jordan, there is no proof from thence 
that \it plunged his disciples m it. 

It is urged that John's choosing a 
place where there was much water is a 
certain proof of immersion. To which 
it is answered, that as there went out 
to him Jerusalein, and all Judea, and all 
the region round about Jordan, that by 
choosing a place where there were 
many streams or; rivulets, it would be 
much more expeditiouslv performed by 
pouring ; and tnat it seems in the nature 
of things highly improbable that John 
shrvild have baptized this vast m-ilti- 
tut'.e by immersion, to say nothing of 
the indecency of both sexes being bap- 
tized together. 

Jesus, it is said, came up out of the 
W^terj but this is said to be no proof 



of his being immersed, as the Greek 
term cltto often signifies yrowz; for in- 
stance, "Who hath warned you to flee 
from, not out of, the wrath to come," 
with many others which might be men- 
tioned. 

Again : it is said that Philip and the 
eunuch went down both i^ito the water. 
To this it is answered, that here is no 
proof of iinmersioji ; for if the expres- 
sion of their going down into the water 
necessarily includes dipping, then Philip 
was dipped as well as the eunuch. The 
preposition («/;) translated into, often 
signifies no more than to or unto. See 
Matt. XV. 24. Rom. x. 10. Acts xxviii. 
14. Matt. xvii. 27. Matt. iii. 11. So that, 
from all these circumstances, it cannot 
be concluded that there was a single 
person of all the baptized who went 
into the water ankle deep. As to the 
apostle's expression, " buried with him 
in baptism,' they think it has no force ; 
and that it does not allude to any cus- 
tom of dipping, any more than our bap- 
tismal crucifixion and death has any 
such reference. It is not the sign but 
the thing signified that is here alluded 
to. As Christ was buried and rose 
again to a heavenly life, so we by bap- 
tism signifying that we are cut off from 
the life of sin, that we may rise again 
to a new life of faith and love. 

To conclude this article, it is observed 
against the mode of immersion, that, as 
it carries with it too much of the ap- 
pearance of a burdensome rite for the 
Gospel dispensation ; that as it is too in- 
decent for so solemn an ordinance ; as 
it has a tendency to agitate the spirits, 
often rendering the subject unfit for the 
exercise of pi-oper thoughts and affec- 
tions, and indeed utterly incapable of 
them ; as in many cases the immersion 
of the body would in all probability be 
instant death ; as in other situations it 
would be impracticable for want of a. 
sufficient quantity of water, it cannot be 
considered as necessaiy to the ordi- 
nance of baptism. 

See Gale, Robinson, Stennett, Gill, 
and Booth, on Antip^dobaptiism ; and 
Wall, He7iry, Bradbury, Bosttvick, 
To-wgood, Addiv.gton, Williams, Ed- 
'waras. Miller, Evans, &amp;c. on the other 
side. 

BAPTISM OF THE DEAD, a cus- 
tom v/hich anciently prevailed ani'.-ug 
some people in Africa, of giving bap- 
tism to the dead. The third council of 
Carthare speaks of it as a th'ng that 
igno ant Christians were f^nd of: Gi'e- 
gory Nazianzen also takes notice of the 
same superstitious opinion. The prac- 
tice seems to be grounded on a vain 



BAP 



44 



BAP 



idea, that, -when men had neglected to 
receive baptism iii theii' life-time, some 
compensation might be made for this 
default bv receiving it after death. 

BAPTISM FOR THE DEAD, a 
practice formerly in use, when a person 
dying without baptism, another was 
baptized in his stead; thus supposin^^ 
that God would accept the baptism of 
the proxy, as though it had been ad- 
ministered to the principal. Chrysos- 
tom says, this was practised among the 
Marcionites with a great deal of ridi- 
culous ceremony, which he thus de- 
scribes: — After any catechumen was 
dead, they hid a living man under the 
bed of the deceased; then, coming to 
the dead man, they asked him whether 
lie would receive baptism ; and he 
making no answer, the other answered 
for him, and said he would be baptized 
in his stead ; and so they baptized the 
living for the dead. If it can be proved 
(as some think it can) that this prac- 
tice was as early as the da}s of the 
apostle Paul, it might probably form a 
solution of those remarkable words in 
1 Cor. XV. 29 : " If the dead rise not at 
all, what shall they do who are baptized 
for the dead *" The allusion of the 
apostle to this practice, however, is re- 
jected by some, and especially by Dr. 
Doddridge, who thinks it too early : he 
thus paraphrases the passage: "Such 
are our views and hopes as Ch- istians ; 
etse, if it were not so, what should they 
do who are baptized in token of their 
embracing the Christian faith, in the 
room, of the dead, who are just fallen 
in the cause of Christ, but are yet sup- 
ported by a succession of new converts, 
•who immediately offer themselves to 
fill up their places, as ranks of soldiers 
that advance to the combat in the 
rooms of their companions who have 
just been slain in their sight ?" 

Lay baptism we find to have been 
permitted by both the common prayA' 
books of king Edward and queen Eliza- 
beth, when an infant was in immediate 
danger of death, and a lawful minister 
could not be had. This was founded on 
a mistaken notion of the impossibility of 
salvation without the sacrament of bap- 
tism ; but afterwards, when they came 
to have clearer notions of the ' sacra- 
ments, it was unanimously resolved in 
a convocation held in 1575, that e^ en 
private baptism m a case of necessity 
was only to be administered by a lawful 
minister. 

BAPTISM METAPHORICAL. In 
Scripture the term Baptism is used as 
referring to the work of the Spirit on j 
th« heart, Matt. iii. 11 ; also to the [j 



sufferings of Christ, Matt. xx. 22 ; and 
to so much of the Gospel as John the 
Baptist taught his disciples. Acts xviii. 
25. 

BAPTISTS, a denomination of Chris- 
tians who maintain that baptism is to be 
administered by immersion, and not by 
sprinkling. See Baptism. 

Although there were several Baptists 
among the Albigenses, W'^aldenses, and 
the followers of Wickliffe, it docs not 
appear that they were formed into any 
stability until the time of Menno, about 
the year 1536. See Anabaptists and 
Mennonites. About 1644 they be- 
gan to make a considerable figure in 
England, and spread thcmsches into 
several separate congregations. They 
separated from the Independents about 
the year 1638, and set up for them- 
selves under the pastoral care of Mr. 
Jesse ; and, having renounced their 
former baptism, they sent over one of 
their number to be immersed by one of 
the Dutch Anabaptists of Amsterdam, 
that he might be qualified to baptize 
his friends in England after the same 
manner. 

The Baptists subsist under two deno- 
minations, viz. the Particular or Cat- 
vinistical, an"d the General or Armi- 
nia'n. Their modes of church govern- 
ment and worship are the same as the 
Independents ; in the exercise of which 
the)' are protected, in common with 
other dissenters, by the act of tolera- 
tion. Some of both denominations allow 
of mixed communion ; by which it is 
understood that those who have not 
been baptized by immersion, on the pra- 
fession of their faith, may sit down at 
the Lord's table with those who have 
been thus baptized. Others, however, 
disallow it, supposing that such have 
not been actually baptized at aU. See 
Free CoiMUNioN. 

Some of them oljserve the seventh 
day of the Aveek as the Sabbath, appre- 
hending the law tliat enjoined it not to 
have been repealed by Christ. 

Some of the General Baptists have, it 
is said, gone into Socinianism, or Arian- 
ism ; on account of which, several of 
their ministers and churches \v\iO dis- 
approve of these principles, have with- 
in the last forty years formed them- 
selves into a distinct connexion, called 
the New Association. The churches in 
this union keep up a friendly acquaint- 
ance, in some outward things, with those 
from whom they have separated ; but 
in things more essential disclaim any 
coniiexion with them, particularly as to 
ch,ing;r.i^ ministers, and the admission of 
members. The General Baptists have,

in some of their churches, three distinct 
orders separately ordained, viz.— mes- 
sengers, elders, and deacons. Their ge- 
neral assembly is held annually in Wor- 
ship Street, London, on the Tuesday m 
the Whitsun week. 

The Baptists have two exhibitions for 
students to be educated at one of the 
universities of Scotland, given them by 
Dr. Wai-d, of Gresham College. There 
is likewise an academy at bristol for 
students, generally known by the name 
of the Bristol Education Society. The 
Baptists in America and in the East and 
\V'est Indies are chiefly Calvinists, and 
hold occasional fellowship with the Par- 
ticular Baptist churches in England. 
Those in Scotland, having imbibed a 
considerable part of the principles of 
Messrs. Glass and Sandeman, have no 
communion with the other. They have 
liberally contributed, however, towards 
the translation of the Scriptures into the 
Bengalee language, which some of the 
Baptist brethren are now accomplishing 
in the East. See Ripfion's Baptist Re- 

fister, vol. i. p. 172 — 175 ; Adams's

BAPTISTERY, the place in which 
the ceremony of baptism is performed. 
In the ancient church, it is said, it was 
generally a buildmg separate, and dis- 
tinct from the church. It consisted of 
an ante-room, where the adult persons 
to be baptized made their confession of 
faith ; and an inner room, where the 
ceremony of baptism was performed. 
Thus it continued to the sixth century, 
when the baptisteries began to be taken 
uito the church. 

BARDESANISTS, a sect so deno- 
minated from their leader Bardesanes, a 
Syrian, of Edessa, in Mesopotamia, who 
lived in the second century. They be- 
lieved that the actions of men depended 
altogether on fate, and that God him- 
self is subject to necessity. — They de- 
nied the resurrection of the body, and 
the incarnation and death of our Sa- 
viour. 

BARLAAMITES, the followers of 
Barlaam, in the fourteenth century, who 
was a very zealous champion in behalf 
of the Greek against the Latin church. 
It is said that he adopted the sentiments 
and precepts of the Stoics, with respect 
to the obligations of morality and the 
duties of life ; and digested them into a 
■\vork of his, which is known by the 
title of Ethica ex Stoicis.. 

BARNABAS, EPISTLES OF, an 
apocryphal work ascribed to St. Barna- 
bas, it was first published in Greek, 



from a copy of father Hugh Menaed, a 
monk, vossius published ii, in 1656, 
with the epistles of Ignatius. — The Gos- 
pel of Bamaljas is another apocryphal 
work ascribed to Barnabas, wherein 
the history of Jesus Christ is given in a 
different manner from that of the evan- 
gelists. 

BARNABITES, a religious order, 
founded in the sixteenth century, by 
three Italian gentleman, who had been 
advised by a famous preacher of those 
days to read carefully the epistles of St, 
Paul. Hence they wei-e called Clerks 
of St. Paul; and Barnabites, because

church of St. Barnabas at Milan. Their 
habit is black ; and their office is to in- 
struct, catechise, and serve in mission. 

BARTHOLOMEW'S DAY, St.

in history, as the anniversary of tl^ 
horrid and atrocious sacrifice of human.', 
blood called the Parisian Massacre. See

Bx\RTHOLOMITES, a religious 
order founded at Geneva in 1307 ; but, 
the monks leading in-egnilar lives, it was 
suppressed in 1650, and their effects 
confiscated. In the church of the mo- 
nastery of this order at Geneva is pre- 
sei-ved the image, which, it is pretend- 
ed, Christ sent to king Abgai-us. 

BASILIAN MONKS, religious, of 
the order of St. Basil, in the fourth cen- 
tury, who, having retired into a desert 
hi the province of Pontus, founded a 
monastery, and drew up rules, to the 
amount of some hundreds, for his disci- 
ples. This new society soon spread all 
over the East ; nor was it long before it 
passed into the West. Some pretend 
that St. Basil saw himself the spiritual 
father of more than 90,000 monks hi the 
East only ; but this order, which flou- 
rished for more than three centuries, 
was considerably diminished by heresy, 
schism, and a change of empire. The 
historians of this order say that it has 
produced 14 popes, 1805 bishops, 3010 
abbots, and 11085 martyrs, besides an 
infinite number of confessors and vir- 
gins. This order likewise boasts of 
several emperors, kings, and princes, 
who have embraced its rule. 

BASILIDIANS, a denomination, in 
the second century, from Basilides, 
chief of the Egyptian Gnostics. He ac- 
knowledged tlie existence of one Su- 
preme God, perfect in goodness and 
wisdom, who produced from his own 
substance seven beings, or aions, of a 
most excellent nature. Two of these 
aions, called Dvnamis and Sophiz (i. e. 
/lovjcr and wisctorn,) engendered the an-

Pels of the highest order. These angels 
formed a heaven for their habitation, 
and brought forth other angelic beings 
of a nature somewhat inferior to their 
own. Many other generations of angels 
followed these. New heavens were also 
created, until the number of angelic 
orders, and of their respective heavens, 
amounted to three hundred and sixty- 
five, and thus equalled the days of the 
year. All these are under the empire 
of an omnipotent Lord, whom Basilides 
called Abraxas. 

The inhabitants of the lowest heavens, 
•which touched upon the borders of the 
eternal, malignant, and self-animated 
matter, conceived the design of forming 
a world from that confused mass, and of 
creating an order of beings to people it. 
This design was carried into execution, 
and was appro\-ed by the Supreme God, 
iKho to the animal life, with which only 
■^-'fte inhaljitants of this new world were 
« fit first endowed, added a reasonable 
soul, giving at tlie same time to the an- 
gels the empire over them. 

These angelic beings, advanced to the 
government of the world which they had 
created, fell by degrees from their ori- 
ginal puritj', and soon nvLuifested the 
fatal marks of their depravity and cor- 
ruption. They not only endeavoured to 
efface in the niinds of men their know- 
ledge of the Supreme Being, tliat they 
might be worshipped in his stead, but 
also began to war against eacli other, 
with an ambitious view to enlarge every 
one the bounds of his respective domi- 
nion. The most arrogant and turbulent 
of all these angelic spirits was that 
which presided over the Jewish nation. 
' — Hence, the Supreme God, beholding 
with compassion the miserable state of 
rational beings, who groaned under the 
contest of these jarring powers, sent 
from hea\"en his son Aw«, or Christ, the 
chief of the aions, that, joined in a sub- 
stantial union with the man Jesus, he 
might restore the knowledge of the Su- 
preme God, destroy the empire of those 
angelic natures which presided over the 
world, and particularly that of the ar- 
rogant leader of the Jewish people. The 
eod of the Jews alarmed at this, sent 
forth his ministers to seize the man Je- 
sus, and put Jiim to death. They exe- 
cuted his commands : but their ciiielty 
could not extend to Christ, against 
whom their efforts were \ain. Those 
souls who obey the precepts of the Son 
rf God, shall, after the dissolution of 
tlieir mortal frame, ascend to the Fa- 
ther, while their bodies return to the 
corrupt mass of matter whence they 
vere iorraed. Disobedient spirits, on the 



contrary, shall pass successively into 

other bodies. 

BATANISTS, or Assassins ; a fa- 
mous heretical sect of murderers among 
the Mahometans, who settled ia Persia 
about 1090. Their head and chief seems 
to have been Hassan Sabah, who made 
fanatical slaves of his subjects. Their 
religion was a compound of that of the 
Magi, the Jews, the Christians, and the 
Mahometans. They believed the Holy 
Ghost resided in their chief; that his 
orders proceeded from God himself, and 
were real declarations of his will. 

This cliief, from his exalted residence 
on Mount Lel^anon, was called the old 
man of the mountain ; who, like a vin- 
dictive deity, with the thuridcrbclt in his 
hand, sent inevitable deatli to .ill quar- 
ters, so that even kings trembled at his 
sanguinary poAver. His subjects v/ould 
prostrate "themselves at the foot of his 
throne, requesting to die by his hand or 
order, as a favour by which they were 
sure of passing into paradise. "Are 
your subjects," said the old man of the 
mounttiin to the son-in-law of Amourj', 
king of Jenisalem, "as reiidv in their 
submission as mine ?" and without stay- 
ing for an answer, made a sign with his 
hand, when ten young men in white, 
who were standing on an adjacent tower, 
instantly threw themselves dowii. To 
one of his guards he said, "Draw' your 
dagger, andphmge it into your breast ;" 
which was no sooner said than obeyed. 
At the command of their chief, they 
made no difficulty of stabbing anyprincc, 
even on his throne ; and for that pur- 
pose conformed to the dress and reli- 
gion of the country that they niight be 
less suspected. To animate them on ' 
such attempts, the Scheik previously 
indulged them with a foretaste of the 
delights of paradise. Delicious soporific 
drinks were given them ; and while 
thev lay asleep, they were carried into 
beautiful gardens, where, awaking as it 
were m paradise, and inflamed with 
views of perpetual enjoyments, they 
sallied forth to'perfoi-m assassinations 
of the blackest dye. 

It is said, they once thought of em- 
bracmg the Christian religion; and some 
have thought the Druses a i-emnant of 
this singular race of barbarians. 

BATH-KOL, (i. e. the daughter of a 
voice,) an oracle among the Jews, frc- , 
quently mentioned in their books, espe- 
cially the Talmud. It was a fantastical 
way of divination invented by the Jews, 
though called by them a revelation from 
God's will, which he made to his chosen 
people after all verbal prophecies had 
ceased in Israel.

BEG 



BAXTERIANS, so called from the 
learned and pious Mr. Richard Baxter, 
who was born in the year 1615. His de- 
sign was to reconcile Calvin and Armi- 
nius: for this purpose he formed a mid- 
dle scheme between their systems. He 
taught that God had elected some, 
whom he is determined to save, with- 
out any foresight of their good works ; 
and that others to whom tlie Gospel is 
preached have common grace, which if 
they improve,- they shall obtain saving 
grace, according to the doctrine of Ar- 
minius. This clenomination own, with 
Calvin, that the merits of Christ's deatii 
are to be applied to believers only ; but 
they also assert that all men are in a 
state capable of salvation. 

Mr. Baxter maintains that there may 
be a certainty of perseverance here, and 
yet he cannot tell whether a man may 
not have so weak a degree of saving 
g;race as to lose it again. 

In order to prove that the death of 
Christ has put all in a state capable of 
salvation, the following arguments are 
alleged by this learned author. 1. It was 
the nature of all mankind which Christ 
assumed at his incarnation, and the sins 
of all mankind were the occasion of his 
suffering. — 2. It was to Adam, as the 
common father of lapsed mankind, that 
God made the promise, (Gen. iii. 15.) 
The conditional new covenant does 
equally give Christ, pardon, and life to 
all mankind, on condition of acceptance. 
The conditional grant is universal : 
JV/iosoever helieveth shall be saved. — 3. 
It is not to the elect only, but to all man- 
kind, that Christ has commanded his 
ministers to proclaim his Gospel, and 
offer the benefits of his procuring. 

There are, Mr. Baxter allows, cer- 
tain fruits of Christ's death which are 
propel- to the elect only: 1. Grace 
eventually worketh in them tme faith, 
repentance, conversion, and union with 
Christ as his living members. — 2. The 
act'aal forgiveness of sin as to the spiri- 
tual and eternal punishment. — 3. Our 
reconciliation with God, and adoption 
and right to the heavenly inheritance. 
— 4. The Spirit of Christ to dwell in us, 
and sanctifv us, bv a habit of divine love, 
Rom. viii. 9—13. Gal. v. 6.-5. Employ- 
ment in holy, acceptable service, and 
access in prayer, with a promise of be- 
ing heard through Christ, Heb. ii. 5, 6. 
John xiv. 13.— 6. Well grounded hopes 
of _ salvation, peace of conscience, and 
spiritual communion with the church 
mystical in heaven and earth, Rom. v. 
12. Heb. xii. 22. — 7. A special interest in 
Christ, and intercession with the Father, 
Rom. viii. 32, 33. — S. Resurrection unto 



life, and justification in judgment ; glo- 
rification of the sou] at death, and of the 
body at the resun-ection, Phil. iii. 20, 21. 
2 Cor. V. 1, 2, 3. 

Christ has made a conditional deed of 
gift of these benefits to all mankind ; but 
the elect only accept and possess them. 
Hence he infers, that though Christ 
never absolutely intended or decreed 
that his death should eventually put all 
men, in possession of those benefits, yet 
he did intend and decree that all men 
should have a conditional gift of them 
by his death. 

Baxter, it is said, wrote 120 books, 
and had 60 written against him. 20,000 
of his Call to the Unconverted were 
sold in one year. He told a friend, that 
six brothers were converted by reading 
that Call. The eminent Mr. Elliott, 
of New England, translated this tract 
into the Indian tongue. A young Indiaix 
prince was so taken with it, that he 
read it with tears, and died with it m 
his hand. Calamy^s Life of Baxter ;

Baxtei'^s E?id of Doctrinal Contro- 
versy, p. 154, 155. 

BEATIFICATION, in the Romish 
church, the act whereby the pope de- 
clares a person happy after death. See 
Canonization. 

BEATITUDE imports the highest 
degree of happiness human nature can 
arrive to, the fiwition of God in a future 
life to all eternity. It is also used when 
speaking of the theses contained in 
Christ's Sermon on the Mount, whereby 
he pronounces the several characters, 
there mentioned blessed. 

BEGHARDS, or Beguards, a sect 
that arose in Germany in the thirteenth 
century, and took St. Begghe for their 
patroness. They employed themselves 
in making linen cloth, each supporting; 
himself by his labour, and were united 
only by the bonds of charity, without 
having any particular rule ; but when 
pope Nicholas IV. had confirmed that 
of the third order of St. Francis in 1289, 
they embraced it the year following. 

BEGUINES, a congregation of nuns 
founded either by St. Begghe or by Lam- 
bert le Begue. They were established, 
first at Leige, and afterwards at Neville, 
in 1207 ; and from this last settlement 
sprang the great number of Beguinages 
which are spread over all Flanders, 
and which have passed from Flanders 
into Germany. In the latter country 
some of them fell into extravagant 
errors, persuading themsehes that it 
was possible in the present life to ar- 
rive to the highest perfection, even t f 
^ impeccability, and a ckar viev/ of God ,

in short, to so eminent a degree of con- 
templation, that there was no necessity, 
after this, to submit tQ the laws of mor- 
tal men, civil or ecclesiastical. The 
council of Vienna, in lllo, condemned 
these errors ; permitting, nevertheless, 
those among them who continued in the 
tme faith to live in charity and peni- 
tence, either with or without vows. 
There still subsists, or at least subsisted 
till lately, many communities of them 
in Flanders. What changes the late re- 
volutions may have eflFected upon these 
nurseries of superstition we have yet to 
learn. 

BEHMENISTS, a name given to 
th&lt;"se mystics who adopt the explica- 
tions of the mysteries of nature and 
grace, as given by Jacob Bchmen. This 
writer was bom in the year 1575, at Old 
Seirienburg, near Gorlitz, in upper I^u- 
satia : he was a shoemaker by trade. He 
is described as having been thoughtful 
and religious from his youth up, taking 
peculiar pleasure in frequenting public 
worship. At length, seriously consider- 
ing within himself that speech of our 
Saviour, J\Iy Father ivhich is in /leaven 
•will s'ive the Holy Spirit to them that 
ask him, he was thereby thoroughly 
awakened in himself, and set forward to 
desire that promised Comforter; and, 
continuing in that earnestness, he was 
at last, to use his own expression, " sur- 
rounded with a divine light for seven 
days, and stood in the highest contem- 
plation and kingdom of joys!" After 
this, about the year 1600, he was again 
surrounded by the divine light, and re- 
plenished with the heavenly knowledge ; 
insomuch as, going abroad into the fields, 
and viewing the herbs and grass, by his 
iuAvard light he saw into their essences, 
use, and properties, \vhich were disco- 
vered to him by their lineaments, figures, 
and signatures. In the .year 1610, he 
had a third special illumination, where- 
in still farther mysteries were revealed 
to him. It was not till the year 1612 
that Behmen committed these revela- 
tions to writing. His first treatise is en- 
titled Atirorg, which was seized on and 
withheld from him by the senate of Gor- 
litz (who persecuted him at the insti- 
gation of the primate of that place) be- 
fore it was finished, and he never after- 
wards proceeded with it farther than 
by adding some explanatory notes. The 
next production of his pen is called The 
Three Principles. In this work he more 
fully illustrates the subjects treated of 
in the former, and supplies what is 
wanting in that work. The contents of 
these two treatises may be divided as 
foliow : 1. How all things came from a 



working will of the holy triiinc incom- 
I prehensible God, manifesting himself as 
Father, Son, and Holv Spirit, through 
! an outward perceptible working triune 
I power of fire, light, and spirit, in the 
1 kingdom of heaven. — 2. How and what 
I angels and men were in their creation ; 
I that they are in and from God, his real 
j offspring ; that their life begun in and 
I from this divine fire which is the Father 
of light, generating a birth of light in 
their souls ; from both Avhich proceeds 
I the Holy Spirit, or breath of divine love 
j in the triune creature, as it does in the 
j triune Creator. — 3. How some angels, 
and all men, are fallen from God, and 
j their first state of a divine triune life 
I in him ; what they are in their fallen 
state, and the diflTerence between the 
fall of angels and that of man. — i. Hoav 
the earth, stars, and elements, were 
created in consequence of the fallen an- 
gels. — 5. Whence there is good and evil 
m all this temporal world, in all its 
creatures, animate and inanimate ; and 
what is meant by the curse that dwells 
every where in it. — 6. Of the kingdom 
of Christ ; how it is set in opposition to 
and fights and strives against the king- 
dom of hell. — 7. How man, through faith 
in Christ, is able to overcome the king- 
dom of hell, and triumph over it in the 
divine power, and thereby obtain eternal 
salvation ; also how, through working 
in the hellish quantity of principle, he 
casts himself into perdition. — 8. How 
and why sin and misery, wrath and 
death, shall only reign for a time, till 
the love, the wisdom, and the power of 
God shall in a supernatural way (the 
mystery of God made man) triumph 
oxev sin, misery, and death ; and make 
fallen man rise to the glory of angels, 
and this material system shake off its 
curse, and enter into an everlasting union 
with that heaven from whence it fell. 

The year after he wrote his Thrcr 
Principles, by which arc to be under- 
stood — the dark world, or hell, in which 
the devils live — the light world, or hea- 
ven, in which the ane;els live — the ex- 
ternal or visible world, which has pro- 
ceeded from the internal and spiritual 
worlds, in which man, as to his bodily 
life, lives; Behmen produced his Three 
fold Life of Man,accordini^ to the Three 
Principles. In this work he treats more 
largely of the state of man in this world : 
1. That he has that immortal spark of 
life which is common to angels and 
devils. — 2. That divine life of the light 
and Spirit of God, vhich makes the 
essential difference between an angel 
and a devil, the last having extinguish- 
ed this divine life in himself; but

tliat man can only attain unto this hea- 
venly life of the second principle through 
the new birth in Christ Jesus. — 3. Tlie 
life of the thii-d principle, or of this ex- 
temal and visible world. Thus the life 
of the hrst and third principles is com- 
mon to all men; but the life of the se- 
cond principle only to a tnae Christian 
or child of (iod. 

Behmen wrote several other treati- 
ses, besides the tliree already enumera- 
ted ; but these three being, as it were, 
the basis of all his other writings, it was 
thought proper to notice them particu- 
larly. His conceptions are often clothed 
under allegorical symbols; and in his 
latter works he has ft-equently adopted 
chemical and Latin phrases to express 
his ideas, which phrases he borrowed 
fi-om convQi'sation with learned men, 
the education he had received being too 
illiterate to furnish him with them : but 
as to the matter contained in his wri- 
tings, he disclaimed ha.ving borrowed it 
either from men or books. He died in 
the year 1624. His last words were, 
"Now I go hence into Paradise." 

Some of Behmen's principles were 
adopted by the late ingenious and pious 
William Law, who has clothed them in 
a more modem dress, and in a less ob- 
scure style. See Btfnnen^s ]Vork3 ; 
Okfiii's Memoirs of Behmen. 

BELIEF, in its general and natural 
sense, denotes a persuasion or an assent 
of the mind to the tnith of any proposi- 
tion. In this sense belief has no relation 
to any particular kind of means or ar- 
guments, bnt may be produced by any 
means whate\"er": thus Ave are said to 
belie\e our senses, to believe our reason, 
to believe a witness. Belief, in its more 
restrained sense, denotes that kind of 
assent which is grounded only on the 
authority or testimony of some person. 
In this sense belief stands opposed to 
knowledge and science. We do not say 
that we believe snow is white, but we 
know it to be so. Buc when a thing is 

f)ropounded to us, of which we ourselves 
lave no knowledge, but which appears 
to us to be true from the testimony given 
to it by another, this is what we call be- 
lief. See Faith. 

BELIEVERS, an appellation given, 
toward the close of the first century, to 
those Christians who had been admitted 
into the church by baptism, and instruct- 
ed in all the mysteries of religion. They 
were thus called in contradistinction to 
the catechumens who had not been bap- 
tized, and were deban-ed from those 
privileges. Among us it is often used 
svnonymously with Christian. See 
Christiak. 



BENEDICTINES, an order of 
monks who professed to follow the 
i-ules of St. Benedict. They were obli- 
ged to perform their devotions seven 
times in twenty-four hours. They were 
obliged always to go two and two toge- 
ther. Every day in Lent they fasted till 
six in the evening, and abated of their 
usual time in sleeping, eating, 8cc. — 
E\ ery monk had two coats, two cowls, 
a table-book, a knife, a needle, and a 
handkerchief; and the furniture of his 
bed was a mat, a blanket, a rug, and a 
pillow. I'he time when this order came 
into England is well known, for to it the 
English owe their coiiAersion from ido- 
latry. They founded the metropolitan 
church of Canterbury, and all the ca- 
thedrals that were afterwards erected. 
The order has produced a vast number 
of eminent men. — Their Alcuinus form- 
ed the university of Paris ; their Diony- 
sius Exiguus perfected the ecclesiasti- 
cal computation ; their Guido invented 
the scale of music ; and their Sylvester 
the organ. 

BENEDICTION, in a general sense 
the act of blessing, or giving praise to 
God, or returning thanks for his favours. 
The Jews, it is said, are obliged to re- 
hearse a hundred benedictions per day, 
of wtiich eighty are to be spoken in the 
morning. It was usual to give a bene- 
diction to travellers on their taking 
leave ; a practice which is still preser- 
ved among the monks. Benedictions 
were likewise given among the ancient 
Jews as well as Christians, by imposi- 
tion of hands. And v.'hen at length the 
primitive simplicity of the Christian 
worship began to give way to ceremony, 
they added the sign of the cross, Avhich 
was made with the same hand as be- 
fore, only elevated or extended. Hence 
benediction in the modern Romish 
church is used, in a more particular 
manner, to denote the sign,of^ the cross 
made by a bishop or prelate as con- 
ferring some grace on the people. 

Benediction is also used tor an eccle- 
siastical ceremony, Avhereby a thing is 
rendered sacred or venerable. In this 
sense benediction differs from consecra- 
tion, as in the latter, unction is applied, 
which is not in the former: thus the 
chalice is consecrated, and the pix liles- 
sed; as the former, not the latter, is 
anointed, though in the common usage 
these two words are applied promiscu- 
ousl)'. The spirit of piety, or rather of 
superstition, has introduced into the 
Romish church benedictions for almost 
every thing: we read of forms of bene- 
dictions for wax can-.Ues, for boughs, 
for ashes, for churcli vessels, for orua.-

mcnts, for flags, or ensigns, arms, Ci'st 
fruits, houses, ships, paschal eggs, cili- 
eium, or the hair-cloth of penitents, 
church-yards, Sec. In general, these be- 
nedictions are performed by aspersions 
of holy water, signs of the cross, and 
prayers suitable to the nature of the ce- 
remony. The forms of these benedic- 
tions are found in the Roman pontifical, 
in the Roman misaal, in the book of ec- 
clesiastical ceremonies, printed in Pope 
Leo X.'s time, and in the rituals and 
ceremonies of the different churches, 
which are found collected in father 
Martene's Avork on the rites and disci- 
pline of the church. 

BENEFICENCE, the practice of 
doing good ; active goodness. — Next to 
justice, the most prominent virtue in the 
system of morality, is beneficence. Pow- 
er makes us to be feared, riches to be 
flattered, learning to be admired; but 
beneficence renders us amiable and use- 
ful in the scale of society. Some quali- 
fications are solitary, and centre mostly 
in ourselves ; but this is social, diffusive, 
and kind. The objects of our benefi- 
cence are all those who are in the sphere 
of our influence and action, without re- 
spect to party or sect. Towai'd supe- 
riors, beneficence expresseth itself^ in 
respect, honour, submission, and ser- 
\nce ; toward inferiors, in liberality, con- 
descension, protection, and support ; to- 
ward equals, in all the offices of love 
their cases require, and which they have 
ability for. It includes all the kind ex- 
ertions on the behalf of the poor, the 
sick, the fatherless, the widow, the dis- 
tressed, &amp;c. and especially those "who 
are of the household of faith," Gal. vi. 
10. The vieayis of beneficence are — 
communication of temporal supplies. 
Gal. vi. 6; prayer, James v. 16; sym- 
pathy, Rom. xii. 15; appropriate ad- 
vice and conversation, C'ol. iii. 16. — Ob- 
ligations to beneficence arise from the 
law of nature. Acts xvii. 26; the law of 
revelation, Heb. xiii. 16; the relations 
we stand in to each other. Gal. vi. 1, 2 ; 
the example of Christ and illustrious 
characters, Acts x. 38; the resemblance 
we herein bear to the best of Beings, 
Acts xiv. 17 ; and the pleasure we re- 
ceive and give in so noble an employ. 
See Benevolence, Charity, Love." 

BENEVOLENCE, the love of man- 
kind in general, accompanied with a de- 
sire to promote their happiness. It is 
distinguished from beneficence, that be- 
ing the /iractice, benevolence the denire 
of doing good. Benevolence must be 
universal, reaching to every mail with- 
CHit exception ; but beneficence cannot 
be so universal, for it is necessarily con- 



fined by several considerations; such as 
our knowledge of objects, and their dif- 
ferent circumstances, as well as our 
own abilities and opportunities of exer- 
cising them. Benevolence or good will 
to others does not imply that we are to 
neglect our own interests. Our sal\ a- 
tion, health, prosperity, and reputation, 
should all be ol)jects of concern: nor 
will tliis clash with the affection we may 
bear toothers; on the contrary, expe- 
riencing the importance of these bless- 
ings ourselves, we shall be anxious for 
others to possess them also. The duties 
of benevolence include those we owe to 
men, purely on the groimd of their be- 
ing of^ the same species with ourselves ; 
such as sympath)-, relief, &amp;c. ; those we 
owe to our country, desiring its honour, 
safety, prosperity ; those we owe to the 
church of God, as love, zeal. Sec; those 
we owe to families and individuals, as 
affection, care, provision, justice, for- 
bearance, &amp;c. Benevolence ma.nifests 
itself by being pleased with the share of 
good every creature enjoys; in a dispo- 
sition to increase it; in feeling an un- 
easiness at their sufferings; and in the 
abhorrence of cinieltv unaer eveiy dis- 
guise or pretext. The desire of doing 
good unconnected with any idea of ad- 
vantage to ourselves is called di.sinte- 
rfs/frf benevolence, though some doubt 
whether, strictly speaking, there be any 
such thing; as benevolence is always

BEREANS, a sect of protestant dis- 
senters from the church of Scotland, 
who take their title from and profess to 
follow the example of the ancient Be- 
reans, in building their system of faith 
and practice upon the Scriptures alone, 
without regard to any human authority 
whatever. 

As to the origin of this sect, we find 
that the Bereans first assembled as a 
separate society of Christians, in the 
city of Edinbvu'gh, in the avitumn of 
1773, and soon after in the Parish of 
Fettercairn. The opponents of the Be- 
rcan doctrines allege that this new sys- 
tem of faith would never ha\e been 
heard of, had not Mr. Barclay, the 



BER

BER 



fDundcr of it, been disappointed of a set- 
tlement in the church cf Scotland. But 
the Bereans in answer to this charge 
appeal not only to Mr. Barclay's doc- 
trine, uniformly preached in the church 
of Fettercairn, and many ctlier places 
in that neighbourhood, for fourteen )-eari&gt; 
before that benefice became vacant, but 
likewise to tv/o different treatises, con- 
taining the same doctrines, published 
by him about ten or twelve years 
before that period. The)' admit, in- 
deed, that previous to May 1773, when 
the general assembly, by sustaining Uie 
king's presentation in favour of Mr. 
Foote, excluded Mr. Barclay from suc- 
ceeding to the church of Fettercaini 
(notwithstanding the almost unanimous 
desire of the parishioners) the Bereans 
had not left the established church, or 
attempted to erect themselves into a 
distinct societ)' ; but they add, that this 
Avas by no nieaus necessary on theii- 
part, until by the assembly's decisicm 
they were in danger of being not only 
deprived of his iiistractions, but of being 
scattered as sheep without a shepherd. 
And the)' add, that it v/as Mr. Birclay's 
open and pulilic avowal, both from the 
pulpit and the press, of those peculiar 
sentiments, wliich now distinguish the 
Bereans, that was the first and princi- 
pal, if not the only cause of the opposi- 
tion set on foot against his settlement in 
Fettercaini. 

The Bereans agree with the gi'eat 
majority of Christians respecting tlic 
doctrine of the Trinitv, which they hold 
as a fundamental article ; and they also 
agree in a great measure with the pro- 
fessed principles of both our established 
churches i-especting predestination and 
election, though they allege that these 
doctrines are not consistently taught in 
either church. But thev differ from the 
majority of all sects of Christians in va- 
rious other important particulars, such 
as, 1. Respecting our knowledge of the 
Deity. Lpcn this subject they say, the 
majority of professed Christians stum- 
ble at the very threshold of revelation ; 
and, by admitting the doctrine of natural 
religion, natural conscience, natural no- 
tices, &amp;c. not founded upon revelation, 
or derived from it by tradition, they give 
up the cause of Christianity at once to 
the infidels ; who may justly argue, as 
Mr. Paine in fact does in" his Age of Rea- 
son, that there is no occasion for any re- 
velation or word of God, if man can" dis- 
cover his nature and perfections from 
his works alone. But this the Bereans 
argue is beyond the natural powers of 
human reason ; and therefore our know- 
ledge of God is from revelation alone, 



and that without revelation man woiild. 
never have entertained an idea of liia 
existence. — 2. With regard to faith in 
Christ, and assurance of salvation 
through his merits, they differ from al- 
most all other sects whatsoever. These 
they reckon inseparable, or rather the 
same, because (say they) "God hath 
expressly declared, he that believeth 
shall be saved; and therefore it is not 
only absurd but impious, and in a man- 
ner calling God a liar, for a man to say 
I believe "the Gospel,'but have doubts, 
nevertheless, of my own salvation." 
\\'\t]\ regard to the various distinctions 
and definitions that have been given of 
different kinds of faith, they argue that 
tiiere is nothing incomprehensible or ob- 
scure in the meaning ot this word as used 
in Scripture; but that as faith, when 
applied to human testimony, signifies 
neither more nor less than tlie mere 
simple belief of that testimony as true, 
upon the authority of the testifier, so, 
wlien applied to the testimony of God, 
it signities precisely "the belief of his 
tcstimon)', and resting upon his veracity 
alone, without an)' kind of collateral 
support from concuiTcnce of any other 
evidence or testimony whatever." And 
thev insist that, as this faith is the gift 
of God alone, so the person to whom it 
is given is as conscious of possessing it 
as the being to whom God gives life is 
of being alive: and therefore he enter- 
tains no doubts either of his faith or his 
consequent salvation through the merits 
of Christ, who died and rose again for 
that ijurpcse. In a word, they argue that 
the Gospel would not be what it is held 
forth to be, glad tidings of great joy, if it 
did not bring full personal assurance of 
eternal salvation to the believer; which 
assurance, they insist, is the present in- 
fallible privilege and portion of every 
individual believer of the Gospel. — 3. 
Consistently with the above definition 
of faith, they say that the sin against 
the Holy Ghost, which has alarmed and 
puzzled so many in all ages, is nothing 
else but unbelief; and that the expres- 
sion — " it shall not be forgiven neither 
in this world nor that which is to come," 
means only that a person dying in infi- 
delit)' would not be forgiven neither un- 
der the former dispensation by Moses 
(the thenp?-e.'ie7it dispensation, kingdom, 
or government of God,) nor under the 
Gos]5el dispensation, which, in respect 
of the Mosaic, was a kind of f iture 
woi'ld or kingdom to come. — 4. The 
Bereans inteipret a great partof the 
Old Testament prophecies, and in par- 
ticnlat- the whole of the Psalms, except- 
ing such as are merely historical or lau- 



BER 



52 



BET 



datory, to be typical or prophetical of 
Jesus Christ, his sufferings, atonement, 
mediation and kingdom ; and they es- 
teem it a gross perversion of these 
psalms and prophecies to apply them-to 
the experiences of private Christians. 
In proof of this, they not only urge the 
words of the apostle, that no prophecy 
is of any private intci-p relation, but they 
insist tliat the whole of the quotations 
from the ancient prophecies in the New 
Testament, and particularly those from 
the Psalms, are expressly applied to; 
Christ. In this opinion many other! 
classes of protestants agree jvlth them. ] 
— 5. Of the absolute all-superintending 
sovereignty of the Almighty, the Be- 1 
reans entertain the highest idea, as Avell \ 
as of tlie uninteri-upted exertion therent ] 
over all liis works, \n heaxen, earth, and j 
hell, however unsearchable by his crea- \ 
tures. A God v&gt;nthont election, they ar- j 
gue, or choice in all his works, is a God 
•without existence, a mere idol, a non- i 
entity. And to deny God's election, pur- | 
pose, and express will in all his works 
IS to make him inferior to ourselves. 

As to their practice and cllsci/ilinc, 
thev consider infant baptism as a "^'ivine 
ordinance, instituted in the room of cir- 
cumcision ; and think it absurd to sup- 
pose that infants, who all agree are ad- 
missible to the kingdom of God in )\ea- 
ven, should, nevertheless, be incapable 
of being admitted into his visible church 
on earth. They commemorate the 
Lord's supper generally once a month ; 
but as the woi-ds of the institution iix 
no particular period, they sometimes 
celebrate it oftener, and sometimes at 
more distant periods, as it may suit their 

feneral convenience. The)' meet every 
lOrd's da)' for the purpose of preach- 
ing, pra)'ing, and exhorting to love and 
good works. With regard to admission 
and exclusion of members, t'neir method 
is veiy simple : *vhen any person, a,fter 
hearing the Berean doctrines, professes 
his belief and assurance of the tnitlis of 
the Gospel, and desires to be admitted 
into then* communion, he is cheerfully 
recei\ed upon his profession, whatever 
may have been his former manner of 
life. But if such a one should afterwards 
draw back from his good profession or 
practice, they first admonish hhn, and, 
if that has no effect, they leave him to 
himself. TJiey do not think that they 
have any power to deliver a backsliding 
brother to Satan ; that text, and' other 
similar passages, such as, "Whatsoever 
ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in 
heaven," Sec. they consider as restrict- 
ed to the apostles, and to the inspired 
testiniony alone, and not to be extended 



to any church on earth, or any number 
of churches or of Christians, whether 
decided by a majority of votes, or by 
unanimous voices. Neither do they think 
themselves authorized, as a Christian 
church, to enquire into each other's po- 
litical opinions, any more than to exa- 
mine into each other's notions of philo- 
sophy. They both recommend andpi-ac- 
tisc, as a Christian duty, submission to 
lawful authority ; but they do not think 
that a man by becoming a Chi'istian, or 
joining their society, is under any obli- 
gation by tlie niles of the Gospel to re- 
nounce his right of private judgment 
upon matters of public or private im- 
portance. Upon all such subjects they 
allow each other to think and act as ei^ch 
may see it his duty ; and they require 
nothing more of the members than a 
uniform and steady profession of the 
apostolic faith, and a suitable walk and 
conversation. 

It is said that their doctrine has found 
converts in various places of Scotland, 
England, and Amenca; and that they 
have congregations in Edinburgh, Glas- 
gow, Paisley, Stirling, Crieff, Dundee, 
Arbroath, Montrose, Fettercairn, Aber- 
deen, and other toxvns in Scotland, as 
Avell as in London, and various places in 
England. 

For farther particula.rs of the doc- 
trines of this sect, see the works of 
Messrs. Barclay, J\''icol, Brookubunk, 
and M'Bae. See also Mr. A. M'Ltan's 
Treatise on the Com?nisaion,- fiv^t edi- 
tion, p. 88. in which Mr. Barclay's no- 
tion of assurance is combated. 

BEHENGARIANS, a denomination, 
in tlie eleventh century, which adhered 
to the opinions of Ber'er.garius, who as- 
serted that the bread and wine in the 
Lord's Supper are not really and essen- 
tially, but hguratively changed into the 
body and Ijlond of Christ. His followers 
were dix ided in opinion as to the eucha- 
rist. Some allowed them to be changed 
in effect ; others admitted a change in 
part; and othtrsan entire change, with 
this restriction, that, to those who com- 
municated u DrthUy, the elements 
were change 1 back again. 

BERYLLIANS, so called from Be- 

ryllus, an Arabian, bishop of Bozarth, 

who flourished in the third century. He 

taught that Christ did not exist before 

Mary; but that a spirit issuing from 

God himself, and therefore superior to 

ijall human souls, as being a portion of 

j the divine nature, was united to him at 

j the time of his birth.

rays, which they wore on theh' breast, 
in memory of the star which appeared

mentioBed this order, but none of them 
have told us their origin, nor where 
their convents were situated ; if we ex- 
cept Matthew Paris, who says that, in 
1257, they obtained a settlement in 
England, which was at Cambridge, in 
Tnimpington-street. 

BIBLE, the name applied by Chris- 
tians by way of eminence, to the col- 
lection of sacred writings, or the holy 
Scriptures of the Old and New Testa- 
ments. 

I. BizhF., ancient Divisions and Or- 
' den of. After the return of the Jews 
from the Babylonish captivity. Ezra 
collected as man}' copies as he could of 
the sacred writings, and out of them all 
prepared a correct edition, arranging 
the several books in their proper oi-der. 
These books he divided into three parts. 1 
I. The law. II. The pi'ophets. III. The } 
Hagiographia, i. e. the holy writings. 
I. The law, contains — 1, Genesis ; — 2, 
Exodus; — :3, Leviticus; — 4, Numbers; 
— 5, Deuteronomy. II. The writings of 
the prophets are — 1, Joshua; — 2, Judges, 
with P»uth; — 3, Samuel; — 4, Kings; — 
5, Isaiah; — 6, Jeremiah, with his La- 
mentations; — 7, Ezekiei; — 8, Daniel; — 
9, Tlie twelve minor prophets ; — 10, 
Job; — 11, Ezra; — 12, Nehemiah; — 13, 
Esther. III. The Hagiographia consists 
of — 1, The Psalms; — 2, The Proverbs; 
— 3, Ecclesiastes; — 4, The Song of 
Solomon. This division was made for 
the sake of reducing the number of the 
sacred books to the number of the let- 
ters in their alphabet, which amount to 
twenty-tv/o. Afterwards the Jews rec- 
koned twenty-four books in their canon 
of scripture; in disposing of which the 
law stood as in the foi-mer division, and 
the prophets were distriljuted into for- 
mer and latter : the former prophets are 
Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and K^ings; the 
latter prophets are Isaiah, Jei-emiah, 
Ezekiei, and the twelve minor prophets. 
And the Hagiographia consists of the 
Psalms, the Proverbs, Job, the Song of 
Solomon, Ruth, the Lamentations, Ec- 
clesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, the 
Chronicles. Under the name of Ezra 
they comprehend Nehemiah: this or- 
der hath not always been observed, but 
the variations from it are of no moment. 
The five books of the law are divided 
into fort}-fi\'e sections. This division 
many of the Jews hold to have been ap- 
pointed by Moses himself; but others, 
with more probability, ascribe it to Ezra. 
The design of this division was that 
one of these sections might be I'ead in 



their synagogues every sabbath day : the 
number was fifty-four, because, in their 
intercalated years, a month being then 
added, there were fifty-four saboaths: 
in other years they i-educed them to 
fifty-two, by twice joining together two 
short sections. Till the persecution of 
Antiochus Epiphanes, they read only 
the law; but, the reading of it being 
then prohibited, they substituted in the 
room of it fifty-four sections out of the 
proplicts; and when the reading of the 
law was restored by the Maccabees, the 
section which was read every sabbath 
out of the law served for their first les- 
son, and the section out of the prophets 
for their second. These sections were 
divided into vei-ses; of which division, 
if Ezra was not the autiior, it was intro* 
duced not long after him, and seems to 
have been designed for the use of the 
Targumists, or Ghaldee intei-preters ; 
for after the return of the Jews trom the 
Babylonish captivit} , wlien the Hebrew 
language ceased to be their mother 
tongue, and the Chaldee grew into use 
instead of it, the custom was, that the 
law should be first read in the original 
Hebrew, and then interpreted to the 
people in the Chaldee langtiage; for 
which puipose these shorter sections 
were ver}' coif\'enient. 

II. Bible, History of. It is thought 
that Ezra published the Scriptures in 
the Chaldee character, for, that lan- 
guage being generally used among the 
Jews, he thought proper to change the 
old Hebrew character for it, which hath 
since that time been retained only bV 
the Samaritans, among whom it is pre- 
served to this day. Prideaux is of opi- 
nion that Ezra made additions in seve- 
ral parts of the Bible, where any thing 
appeared necessary for illustrating, con- 
necting, or completing the work; in 
which he appears to have been assisted 
by the same Spirit in which they were 
first written. Among such additions are 
to be reckoned the last chapter of Deu- 
teronomy, wherein Moses seems to give 
an account of his own death and burial, 
and the succession of Joshua after him. 
To the same cause our learned author 
thinks are to be attributed many other 
mterpolations in the Bible, which crea- 
ted difficulties and objections to the au- 
thenticity of the sacred text-, no ways to 
be solved without allowing them. Ezi-a 
changed the names of several places 
which were grown obsolete, and, in- 
stead of them, put their new names. by 
which they were then called in the text. 
Thus it is that Abraham is said to have 
pursued the kings who carried Lot away 
captive as far as Dan; whereas that 



BIB 



54 



BIB 



place in Moses's time was called Laish, 
the name Dan being unknown till the 
Dauites, long after the death of Moses, 
possessed themseh-es of it. The Jewish 
canon of Scripture was th.cn settled by 
Ezra, yet not so but that several varia- 
tions have been made in it. Malachi, for 
instance, could not be put in the Bible 
by him, since that prophet is allowed to 
have lived after Ezra ; nor could Nehe- 
miah be there, since that book mentions 
(chap. :di. v. 22) Jaddua as high priest, 
and Darius Codomanus as king of Per- 
sia, v.'lio were at least a hundred yeai's 
later than Ezra. It may be added, that, 
in the first book cf Chronicles, the ge- 
nealcgj' of the sons of Zeniljbabel is car- 
ried down for so many generfitions as 
must necessarily bring it to the time of 
Alexander; and consequently this book, 
or at least this part of it, could not be in 
the canon in Ezra's days. It is probable 
the two books of Chronicles, Ezra, Ne- 
hemiah, Esther, and Malachi, were 
adopted into the Bible in the time of 
Simon the Just, tlie last of the men of 
the great synagogue. The Jcavs, at iii-st, 
were ^xry reserved in conmiunicating 
their Scriptures to strangers; despising 
and shunning the Gentiles, they would 
not disclose to them luiy of the treasuros 
concealed in the Bible'.* We may add, 
that the people borderir.g on the Jews, 
as the Egyptians, Phrenicians, Arabs, 
&amp;c. were not verj- curious to know the 
laws or history of a people, whom in 
their turn they hated and despised. 
Tlieir first aco/aaintance with these 
boC'ks was not till after the several cap- 
tivities of the Jews, when the singularity 
of the Hebrew laws and ceremonies in- 
duced several to desire a more particu- 
lar knowledge of them. .Tosephus seems 
sunirised to find such slight footsteps of 
the Scripture history interspersed in the 
Egyptian, Chaldean, Phcenician, and 
Grecian historj', and accounts for it 
hence; tliat the sacred books were not 
as yet translated into Greek, or otlier 
languages, and consequently not known 
to the writers of those nations. The 
first version of the Bible was that of the 
Se;)tuagint into Greek, by order of that 
patron of literatui-e, Ptolemy Philadel- j 
phus; thougii some maintain that the 
whole was not then translated, but only 
the Pentateuch ; between wliich and i 
the other books in the Septuagint ver- 
sion, the critics find a great diversity in 
point of style and expression, as well as 
of accuracy. 

III. BiBLK, modern Divisions of. The 
division of the Scriptvn-es into chanters, I 
as we at present havt; them, is of mo- 
dern date. Some attribute it to Stephen 1 



Langton, archbishop of Canterbury, hi 
the reigns of John and Heiny III. But 
the true author of the invention was 
Hugo de Sancto Caro, commonly called 
Hugo Cardinalis, because he was the 
first Dominican that ever was raised to 
the degree of cardinal. This Hugo flou- 
rished about A. D. 1240: he -wrote a 
comment on the Scriptures, and pro- 
jected the first concordance, which is 
that of tlie vulgar Latin Bible. The aim 
of this work being for the more easy 
iinding out any woi-d or passage in the 
Scriptures, he found it necessary to di- 
vide the book into sections, and the sec- 
tions into subdivisions; for till that t'me 
the \-ulgar Latin Bibles were without 
any division at all. These sections are 
the chapters into which the Bible hath 
ever since been divided; but the subdi- 
vision of the chapters was not then into 
verses, as it is now. Hugo's ir.ethod of 
subdividing them was by the letters A, 
B, C, D, E, F, G, placed in the margin, 
at an equal distance fi*om each other, 
pccording to the length of the chapters. 
The subdivision of the cliapters into 
verses, as they now stand in cur Bibles, 
had its original from a fiimous Jewish 
Rabbi, named Mordecai Nathan, about 
14-1-5. Tills rabbi, in imitation of Hugo 
Cardinalis, drew up a concordance to 
the Hebrew Bible, for the use of the 
Jews. But thougli he follov/ed Hugo 
in his di-. ision of the books into chap- 
ters, he refined upon his inventions as 
to the subdivision, and contrived that 
by verses: this being found to be a 
much more convenient method, it has 
hecn ever since followed. And thus, as 
tlie Jews borrowed the division of the 
books of the Holy Scriptures into chap- 
tei's from the Christians, in like man- 
ner the Christians borrowed th.at of the 
chapters into verses from the Jews. 
The present order of the several books 
is almost the same (the Apocrj'pha ex- 
cepted) as that made by the council of 
Trent. 

IV. Bible, rejected Books of. The 
apocryphal books of the Old Testa- 
ment, accoi'ding to the Romanists, are 
the book of Enoch (see Jiide 14,) the 
third and fourth books of Esdras, the 
third and fourth books of Maccabees, 
the prayer ci' Manasseh, the Testa- 
ment of the twelve Patriarchs, the 
Psalter of Solomon, and some other 
pieces of this nature. Tlie apocryphal 
books of the New Testament are the 
epistle of St. Barnabas, the pretended 
epistle of St. Paul to the Laodiccans, 
several spurious Gospels, Acts of the 
Apostles, and Rexelations; the book 
of' Hennas, entitled the Shepherd; 



BIB 



55 



BIB 



Jesus Christ's letter to Abganis; the 
epistles of St. Paul to Seneca, and se- 
veral other pieces of the like nature; 
as may be seen in the; collection of the 
• apocryphal -writings of the New Testu- 
ment made l^y Fabricius. Pi-otestants, 
while Ihey agree with the Roman Ca- 
tholics in rejecting all those as unc&lt;i- 
nonical, have also justly rejected the 
boclts of Tobit, Judith, W'isdom, Ec- 
clesiasticus, Baruch, and 1st and 2nd 
Maccabees. 

V. BiBLK, Translations of. We 
have alveadv mentioned the first trans- 
lation of the Old Testament bv the 
LXX. (^ 2.) Both Old and New Testa- 
ments were afterwards translated into 
Latin bv the primitive Christians; and 
while the Roman empire subsisted in 
EJirope, the reading of the Scriptures 
in the Latin tongue, which was the 
universal language of that empire, pre- 
\ailed eveiy where ; but since the face 
of affairs in Europe has been changed, 
and so many different monarchies erect- 
ed upoTi the' ruins of the Roman empire, 
the Latin tongue has by degi-ees grown 
into disuse ; whence has arisen a neces- 
sity of translating- the Bible into the re- 
gjDCCtive languages of each people ; and 
this has produced as many difterent 
versions of the Scri])tures m the m.o- 
dcrn lang^iages as there are different 
nations professing the Christian religion. 
Of the principal of these, as well as of 
some other ancient translations, and 
the earliest and most elegant printed 
editions, we shall now take notice in 
their order. 

1. ^ihhY., Ar7nentan. There is a very 
ancient Armenian version of the whole 
Eible, done from the Greek of the LXX. 
bv some of their doctors, about the time 
of Chrysostom. This was f.rst printed 
entire, 1664, by one of their bishops at 
Amsterdam, in quarto, with the New 
Testament in octavo. 

2. Bible, Bohemian. The Bohe- 
mians have a Bible translated by eight 
of their doctors, whom they had sent 
to the schools of Wirtemberg and Basil 
on purpose to study the original lan- 

, guages: it was prhited in Moravia in 
&lt; 1539. 

3. BiBLK, Croatian. A translation of 
the New Testament into the Croatian 
language waspuljlished by Faber Creim, 
ami others, in 1562 and 1563. 

4. Bible, Gselic. A few years ago, a 
version of the Bible in the Gaelic or 
Erse language was published at Edin- 
burgh, where the Gospel is preached 
regTdarly in that language in two chap- 
els, for the benefit ot the natives of the 
Highlands. 



5. Bible, Georgian. The inhabitants 
of Cieorgia, in Asia, have long had a 
translation of the Bible in their ancient 
language ; but that language having 
now become almost obsolete, and the 
Georgians in general being veiy igno- 
rant, few of them can either read or 
understand it. 

6. Bible, Gothic. It is generally said 
that Ulphilas, a Gothic bishop, who 
lived in the fourth century, made a ver- 
sion of the whole Bible, except the book 
of Kings, for the use of his countrymen ; 
that book he omitted, because of the 
fre(]^uent mention of the wars therein, 
as tearing to inspire too much of the 
military genius into that people. We 
liavc nothing remaining of this version 
l)ut the four Evangelists, printed in 
cmarto, at Dort, in 1665, from a very 
ancient manuscript. 

7. Bible, Gri^on. A translation of 
the Bilile into the language of the Gri- 
sons, in Italy, was completed by Coir, 
and published in 1720. 

8. Bible, Icelandic. The inhabi- 
tants f)i Iceland have a version of the 
Bible in their language, vvhich was 
translated Ijy Thorlak, and published 
in 1584. 

9. Bible, Indian. A translation of 
the Bible into the North America 
Indian language, by Elliot, was pub- 
lished in. quarto, at Cambridge, in 
1685. 

10. Bible, Irish. About the middle 
of the sixteenth century. Bedell, bisho]? 
of Kihnore, set on foot a translation of 
the Old Testament into the Irish lan- 
guage, the New Testament and the 
Liturgy having been before translated 
into that language ijit^'^i shop appoint- 
ed one King to execute this work, who, 
not imderstanding the oriental lan- 
guages, was obliged to translate it from 
the English. This work v/as received 
bv Bedell, who, after having compared 
tiie Irish with the English translation, 
compai'ed the latter with the Hebrew, 
the LXX. and the Italian version of 
Diodati. \\^'!en it was finished, the 
bishop would have been himself at the 
charge of the impression; but his de- 
sign was stopped, upon advice given 
to the lord lieutenant and archbishop 
of Canterburv, that it would seem 
a shameful thing for a nation to pub- 
lish a Bible translated by such a des- 
picable hand as King : hovv^ever, tlie 
manuscript was not lost, for it went 
to press in 1685, and was afterwards 
published.

Messrs. Ziegenbald and Gvincller, two

ment. 

13. Bible, Malayan. About 1670, 
Sir Robert Boyle m-ocured a transla-

Malayan language, which he printed, 
and sent the whole impression to the 
East Indies. 

14. Bible, Rhemish. See No. 23. 

15. Bible, Samaritan. At the head 
of the oriental versions of the Bible 
must be placed the Samaritan, as being 
the most ancient of all (though neither 
its age nor autlior have been yet ascer- 
tained,) and admitting no more for the 
H-ly Scripture but the five books of 
Moses. This translation is made frorr. 
the Samaritan Hebrew text, which is a 
little di.Terent from the Hebrew text of 
the Jews: this version has never been 
printed alone, nor any wiiere but in the 
rolyglots of London and Paris. 

16. Bible, Swedish. In 1534, Olaus 
and Laurence published a Swedish 
Bible from the German version of Mar- 
tiji Luther: it was revised in 1617 by 
order of king (iustavus Adclphus, and 
Avas afterwards almost universally re- 
ceived. 

17. Bible, Anglo-Saxon. — If we en- 
quire into the versions of the Bible of 
our own countrv, we shall find that 
Adelni, bishop of Sherburn, who lived 
in 709, made an English Saxon version 
of the Psalms ; and that Edfrid, or Ec- 
bert, bishop of Lindisferne, who lived 
about 730, translated several of the 
books of Scripture into the same lan- 
guage. It is said, likewise, the vener- 
able Bede, tvho died in 785, translated 
the whole Bible into Sr.xon. — But Cuth- 
bert, Bede's disciple, in the enumera- 
tion of his master's works, speaks only 
of his ti-anslation of the Gospel, and 
says nothing of the rest of the Bible. 
Some say that king Alfred, who lived 
about 890, translated a great part o:" 
the Scriptures. We find an old ver- 
sion in the Anglo Saxon of several 
books of the Biljle, made by Elfric, ab- 
bot of Malmcsburv: it was published 
at Oxford in 1699. There is an old 
Anglo Saxon version of the four Gos- 
pels, published by Matthew Parker,; 
archbishop of Canterbur)', in 1571, the 
author whereof is unknown. Mr. Mill 
obserN'^es, that this version was made 
from a Latin copy of the old Vulgate. 
The whole Scripture is said by some 
to have been translated into the Anglo 
Saxon by Bede, about 701, though 



others contend he only translated the 
Gospels. We have certain bnt-ks or 
parts of the Bible by several other 
translators; as, first, "the Psalms, by 
Adelm, bishop of Sherburn, cotempo- 
rary with Bede, though b\' others this 
version is attriljuted to king Alfred, 
wio lived two huuch'ed years later. 
Another version of the Psalms, in An- 
^lo Saxon, was published by Spelman 
in 1640. — 2. The evangelist's, still ex- 
tant, done from the ancient Vulgate, 
before it was revised by St. Jerome, by 
an author unknown, and published by 
Matthew Parker in 1571. An old Sax- 
on version of s^^ eral books of the Bible 
made by Elfric, abbot of Malmesbuiy, 
I several fragments of which were pub- 
lished by \Vili. Lilly, 1638 ; the genuine 
copy by Edm. Tliwaites, in 1699, at 
Oxford. 

IS. Bibles, Arabic. In 1516, Aug. 
Justinian, bishop of Nebio, printed at 
Genoa an Arabic version of the Psalter, 
with the Hebrew text and Chaldee 
paraphrase, adding Latin inteipreta- 
tions : there are also Arabic versions of 
the Avhole Scripture in the Polyglots of 
London and Paris ; and we have an 
edition of the Old Testament entire, 
printed at Rome, in 1671, by order of 
the congregation f/f firopaganda Jide ; 
put it is of little esteem, as having been 
Mtered agreeably to the Vulgate edi- 
tion. The Arabic Bibles among us are 
jiot the same with those used with the 
phristians in the East. Some learned 
(nen take the Arabic version of the 
Did Testament printed in the Poly- 
Hots to be that of Saadias's, who lived 
Kbout A. D. 900: their reason is, that 
Alien Azer, a great antagonist of Saa- 
dias, quotes some passages of his ver- 
sion, which are the same w ith those in 
the Arabic version of the Polyglots; 
yet others are of opinion that Saadias's 
version is not extant. In 1622, Ei-pe- 
nius printed an Arabic Pentateuch call- 
ed also the Pentateuch of Maurita- 
nia, as being m;ide b}' the Jews of Bar- 
bary, and for their use. This version 
is very litei'al, and esteemed veiy ex- 
act. The four evangelists have also 
been published in Arabic, with a Latin 
version, at Rome, in 1591, folio. These 
have been since reprinted in the Poly- 
glots of London and Paris, with some 
little alteration of Gabriel Sionita. Er- 
penius published an Arabic New Tes- 
tament entire, as he found it in his 
manuscript copj', at Leyden, 1616. 
There are some other Arabic versions 
of later date mentioned by Walton in 
his Prolegomena, particularly a version 
of the Psalms, preserved at Sion Col-

lege, London, and another of the pro- 

Ehets at Oxford ; neither of which have 
een published. Proposals were issued 
for printing a new edition of the Ara- 
bic Bible, by Mr. Carl3de, chancellor of 
the diocese of Carlisle, and professor of 
Arabic m the university of Cambridge ; 
but I am sorry to ■add that he has been 
called away by death, without finish- 
ing it. 

19. Bibles, Cligldee, are only the 
glosses or expositions made by the Jews 
at the time when they spoke the Chal- 
dee tongue : these they call by the 
name of targumim, or paraphrases, as 
not being any strict version of the 
Scripture. They have been inserted 
entire in the large Hebrew Bibles of 
Venice and Basil ; but are read moi-e 
commodiously in the Polyglots, being 
there attended with a Latin transla- 
tion. 

20. Bibles, Coptic. There are se- 
veral manuscript copies of the Coptic 
Bible in some of the great libraries, es- 
pecially in that of the late French 
king. Dr. WilkLns published the Cop- 
tic New Testament, in quarto, in 1716 ; 
and the Pentateuch also in quarto, in 
1731, with Latin translations. He 
reckons these versions to have been 
made in the end of the second or the 
beginning of the third century. 

21. Bibles, Danish. The first Da- 
nish Bible was published by Peter Pal- 
ladus, Olaus Chrysostom, John Synnin- 
gius, and John Maccabxus, in 1550, in 
which they followed Luther's first Ger- 
man version. There are two other ver- 
sions, the one by John Paul Resenius, 
bishop of Zealand, in 1605 ; the other 
of the New Testament onh', by John 
Michel, in 1524.

24. Bibles, English. The first 
English Bible we read of was that trans- 
lated by J. Wickliffe, about the vear 
1360, but never printed, though there 
are manuscript copies of it in several 
of the public" libraries. A translation, 
however, of the New Testament by 
Wickliffe was printed by Mr. Lewis, 
about 1731. J. de Trevi'sa, who died 
about 1398, is also said to have trans- 
lated the whole Bible; but whether 
any copies of it are remaining does not 
appear The first printed Bible in our 
language was that translated bv W. 
Tindal, assisted by Miles Coverdale, 
printed abroad in 1526; but most of 
the copies were bought up and burnt 
by bishop Tunstal and Sir Thomas 
More. It only contained the New Tes- 



tament, and was revised and republish- 
ed by the same person in 1530. The 
Erologues and prefaces added to it, re- 
ect on the bishops and clergy ; but 
this edition was also suj^pressed, and 
the copies burnt. In 1532, Tindal and 
his associates finished the whole Bible, 
except the Apocrypha, and printed it 
abroad : but, while he was afterwards 
preparing a second edition,he was taken 
up and burnt for heresy in Flanders. 
On Tindal's death, his work was car- 
ried on b}-- Coverdale, and John Rogers, 
superintendant of an English church in 
Germany, and the first INlartyr, in the 
reign of queen. Mary, who translated 
the Apocr3^pha, and revised Tindal's 
translation, comparing it with the He- 
brew, Greek, Latin, and German, and 
adding prefaces and notes from Lu- 
ther's Bible. He dedicated the whole 
to Henry VIII. in 1537, under the bor- 
rowed name of Thomas Matthews ; 
whence this has been usually railed 
Matthew's Bible. It was printed at 
Hamburgh, and license obtained for 
publishing it in England, by the favour 
of archbishop Cranmer, and the bishops 
Latimer and Shaxton. The first Bible 
printed by authority in England, and 
publicly set up in churches, was the 
same Tindal's version, revised and 
compared with the Hebrew, and in 
many places amended by Miles Cover- 
dale, afterwards bishop of Exeter; 
and examined after him by archbishop 
Cranmer, who added a preface to it ; 
whence this was called Cranmer's 
Bible. It was printed by Grafton, of 
the largest volume, and published iu 
15»'0; and, by a royal proclamation, 
every parish was obliged to set one of 
the copies in their church, under the 
penalty of forty shillings a jnonth ; yet, 
two years after, the popish bishops ob- 
tained its suppression by the king. It 
was restored under Edward VI., sup- 
pressed again under queen Maiy's 
reign, and restored again in the first 
year of queen Elizabeth, and a new 
edition of it given in 1562. Some Eng- 
lish exiles at Geneva, in queen Marv's 
reign. Viz. Coverdale, Goodman, Gil- 
bie, Sampson, Cole, Wittingham, and 
Knox, made a new translation, printed 
there in 1560, the New Testament 
having been printed in 1557; hence 
called the Geneva Bible, containing 
the variations of readings, marginal 
annotations, 8cc. on account of which it 
was much valued by the puritan party 
in that and the following reigns. Abp. 
Pai'ker resolved on a new translation 
for the public use of the church ; and 
I engaged the bishops, and other learned

nicii, to take each a share or portion: 
these, being afterwards joined together 
and printed, with short annotations, in 
1568, in large foUo, made what was 
afterwards called tl\e Great English 
Bible, and commonly the Bishops' 
Bible. In 1589, it was also published 
in octavo, in a small but fine black let- 
ter; and here the chapters were di- 
vided into Aerses, but without any 
breaks for them, in Avhich the method 
of the Geneva Bible was followed, 
which was the first English Bible where 
any distinction of verses was made. It 
■was afterwards printed in large folio, 
ivith corrections, and several prolego- 
mena in 1572 : this is called Matthew 
Parker's Bible. The initial letters of 
each translator's name were put at the 
end of his part ; e. gr. at the end of the 
Pentateuch, W. E.for William Exon ; 
that is, William, bishop of Exeter, 
whose allotment ended there : at the 
end of Samuel, R. M. for Richard Me- 
nevensis ; or bishop of St. DaAid's, to 
whom the second allotment fell : and 
the like of the rest. The archbishop 
oversaw, directed, examined, and fin- 
ished the whole. This translation Avas 
used in the churches for forty years, 
though the Geneva Bible was more 
read in private houses, being printed 
above twenty times in as many years. 
King James bore it an inveterate hatred, 
on account of the notes, which, at the 
Hampton Court conference, he charged 
as partial, untiiie, seditious, 8cc. The 
Bishops' Bible, too, had its faults. 
The ting frankly owned that he had 
seen no good translation of tlie Bible in 
English ; but he thought that of Ge- 
neva the worst of all. After the trans- 
lation of the Bible by the bishops, two 
other private versions had been made 
of the New Testament ; the first by 
Laurence Thompson, from Beza's Latin 
edition, with the notes of Beza, pulilish- 
ed in 1582, in quarto, and afterwards 
in 1589, varying veiy little from the 
Geneva Bible ; the second by the Pa- 

Sists at Rheims, in 1584, called the 
hemish Bible, or Rhemish translation. 
These, finding it impossible to keep 
the people from having the Scriptures 
in their vulgar tong\ie, resolved to gi^^e 
a version of their o\vn, as favourable to 
their cause as might be. It was printed 
on a large paper, with a fair letter and 
margin: one complaint against it was, 
its retaining a multitude of Hebrew 
and Greek words untranslated, for 
want, as the editors express it, of 
proper and adequate terms in the 
English to render them by; as the 
woi'ds azymes, tunike, holocaust, pre- 



fiucc, jimche, 8cc.: however, many of 
the copies were seized by the queen's 
searchers, and confiscated ; and T hf^mas 
Cartwright was solicited by secretary 
Walsingham to refute it; but, after a 
good progress made therein, ai-chbishop 
Whitgift prohibited his further pro- 
ceeding, as judging it improper that 
the doctrine of the church of England 
should be committed to the defence of 
a puritan ; and appointed Dr. Fulke in 
his place, who refuted the Rhemists 
with great spirit and learning. Cart- 
wright's refutation was also afterwai'ds 
published in 1618, under archbishop 
Abbot. About thirty years after their 
New Testament, the Roman Catholics 
published a translation of the Old at 
Douay, 1609, and 1610, from the Vul- 
gate, with annotations, so that the 
English Roman Catholics have now 
the whole Bible in their mother tongue ; 
though, it is to be observed, they are 
forbidden to read it without a license 
from their superiors. The last English 
Bible v/as that which proceeded from 
the Hampton Court conference, in 
1603; where, many exceptions being 
made to the Bishops' Bible, king James 
gave order for a new one ; not, as the 
preface expresses it, for a translation 
altogether new, nor yet to make a good 
one better ; or, of many good ones, one 
best. Fifty-four learned men were a))- 
poiiited to" this office by the king, as 
appeal's Ijy his letter to the archbishop, 
dated 1604; which being three years 
before the translation was entered upon, 
it is probable seven of them were either 
dead, or had declined the task ; since 
Fuller's list of tlie translators makes 
but forty-seven, who, being ranged un- 
der six "divisions, entered on their pro- 
vince in 1607. It was published in 
1613, with a dedication to James, and 
a learned preface; and is commonly 
called king James's Bible. After this, 
all the other versions dropped, and fell 
into disuse, except the epistles and 
Gospels in the Common Prayer Book, 
which were still continued according to 
the Bishops' translation till the altera- 
tion of the liturgy, in 1661, and the 
psalms and h3mns, which ai'e to this 
day continued as in the old version. 
The judicious Selden, in his Table- 
talk, speaking of the Bible, says, "The 
English translation of the Bible is the 
best translation in the world, and ren- 
ders the sense of the original best; 
taking in for the English translation the 
Bishops' Bible, as well as king James's. 
The translators in king James's time 
took an excellent wav. That part of 
the Bible was given to him who was

most excellent in such a tongue (as the 
Apocrypha to Andrew Downs:) and 
then mey met together, and one read 
the tran-ijation, the rest holding in their 
hands some Bible, either of the learned 
tongues, or French, or Spanish, or 
Italian, &amp;c. If they found anj' fault, 
they spoke ; if not, he read on." [King 
James's Bible is that now read by au- 
thority in all the churches in Britain.] 
Notwithstanding, however, the excel- 
lency of this translation, it must be ac- 
knowledged that our increasing ac- 
quaintance with oriental customs and 
manners, and the changes our language 
has undergone since king James's time, 
are very powerful arguments for a new 
translation, or at least a correction of 
the old one. There have been various 
English Bibles with marginal refer- 
ences by Canne, Hayes, Barker, Scat- 
tergood. Field, Tennison, Lloyd, Rlay- 
ney, Wilson, &amp;c. ; but the best we 
have, perhaps, of this kind, are Brown's 
and Scott's, 

25. Bibles, Eihiofiic. The Ethio- 
pians have also translated the Bible 
mto their language. There have been 
printed separately the Psalms, Canti- 
cles, some chapters of Genesis, Ruth, 
Joel, Jonah, Zephaniah, Malachi, and 
the New Testament, all which have 
been since reprinted in the Polyglot of 
London. As to the Ethiopic New 
Testament, which v/as first printed at 
Rome in 1548, it is a very maccurate 
work, and is reprinted in the English 
Polyglot with all its faults. 

26. Bibles, Flemish. The Flemish 
Bibles of the Romanists are very nu- 
merous, and for the most part have no 
author's name prefixed to them, till 
that of Nicholas Vinck, printed at 
Louvam in 1548. The Flemish ver- 
sions made use of by the Calvinists till 
1637, were copied principally from that 
of Luther. But the Synod of Dort 
having, m 1618, appointed a new trans- 
lation of the Bible into Flemish, depu- 
ties were named for the work, which 
was not finished till 1637. 

27. Bibles, French. The oldest 
French Bible we hear of is the version 
of Peter de Vaux, chief of the 'W^al- 
denses, who lived about the year 1160. 
Raoul de Preste translated the Bible 
into French in the reign of king 
Charles V. of France, about A. D. 
1383. Besides these, there are several 
old French translations of particular 
parts of the Scripture. The doctors 
of Louvain published the Bible in 
French at Louvain, by order of the 
emperor Charles V. in 1550. There 
is a version by Isaac le Maitre dc Sacy, 



published in 1672, with explanations of 
the literal and spiritual meaning of the 
text; which was received with won- 
derful applause, and has often been re- 
printed. Of the New Testaments in 
French, which have been printed se- 
parately, one of the most remarkable 
is that of F. Amelotte, of the Oratory, 
composed by the direction of sorne 
French prelates, and printed with an- 
notations in 1666, 1667, and 1670. The 
author pi-etends he had searched all 
the libraries in Europe, and collated 
the oldest manuscripts: but, in examin- 
ing his work, it appears that he has 
produced no considerable various read- 
ings which had not before been taken 
notice of either in the London Polyglot, 
or elsewhere. The New Testament 
of Mons, printed in 1665, with the 
archbishop of Cambray's permission, 
and the king of Spam's license, made 
great noise m the world. It was con- 
demned hj pope Clement IX. in 1668 ; 
by pope Innocent XI. in 1669; and in 
several bishoprics of France at several 
times. The New Testament, publish- 
ed at Trevoux, in 1702, by M. Simon, 
with literal and critical annotations 
upon difhcult passages, was condemned 
bv the bishops of Paris and Meaux in 
1702. F. Bohours, a Jesuit, with the 
assistance of F. F. Michael Tellier 
and Peter Bernier, Jesuits, likewise 
published a translation of the New 
Testament in 1697 ; but this translation 
is for the most part harsh and obscure, 
which was owing to the author's adhe- 
ring too strictly to the Latin text. 
There are likewise French transla- 
tions published by Protestant authors ; 
one by Robert Peter Olivetan, printed 
in 1535, and often reprinted with the 
corrections of John Calvin and others ; 
another by Sebastian Castalio, re- 
markable for particvilar ways of ex- 
pression never used bv good judges of 
the language. John l)iodati likeAvise 
published a French Bible at Geneva in 
1644; but some find fault with his 
method, in that he rather paraphrases 
the text than translates it. Faber Sta- 
palensis ti'anslated the New Testament 
into French, which was revised and 
accommodated to the use of the refor- 
med churches in Piedmont, and print- 
ed in 1534. Lastly, John le Clerc pub- 
lished a New Testament in French at 
Amsterdam, in 1703, with annotations 
taken chiefly from Grotius and Ham- 
mond ; but the use of this version was 

i| prohibited by order of the states-gene- 

l| ral, as tending to revive the errors of 

Ij Siibellius and Socinus.

most ancient translation of the Bible in 
the German language is that of Ulphi- 
las, bishop of the Gotlis, in the year 
360. An imperfect manuscript of this 
version was tound in the abbey of Ver- 
den, near Cologne, written in letters of 
silver, for which reason it is called 
Codex Argenteus; and it was published 
by Francis Junius in 1665. The oldest 
German printed Bible extant is that of 
Nuremburg, in 1447 ; but who was the 
author of it is uncertain. John Emzer, 
chaplain to George duke of Saxony, 
published a version of the New Testa- 
ment in opposition to Luther. There 
is a German Bible of John Ekeus in 
1537, with Emzer's New Testament 
added to it; and one by Ulemburgius 
of Westphalia, procured by Ferdinand 
duke of Bavaria, and printed in 1630. 
Martin Lutlier having employed ele- 
ven years in translating the Old and 
New Testaments, published the Penta- 
teuch and the New-'festament in 1522, 
the historical books and the Psalms in 
1524, the books of Solomon in 1527, 
Isaiah in 1529, the Prophets in 1531, 
and the other books in 1530. The 
learned agree that his lajiguage is pure, 
and the version clear and free from in- 
tricacies. It was revised by several 
persons of quality, who were masters 
of all the delicacies of the German lan- 
guage. The German Bibles which 
have been printed at Saxony, Switzer- 
land, and elsewhere, are, for the most 
f)art, the same as that of Luther, with 
ittle vai-iation. In 1604, John Piscator 
published a version of the Bible m 
German taken from that of Junius and 
Tremellius ; but his turn of expression 
is purely Latin, and not at all agree- 
able to the genius of the German lan- 
guage. The Anabaptists have a Ger- 
man Bible printed at Worms in 1529. 
John Crellius published his version of 
the New Testament at Racovia in 
1630, and Felbinger his at Amsterdam 
in 1660. 

29. Bibles, Greek. There are 
many editions of the Bible in Greek, 
but they may be all reduced to three 
or foiu- principal ones ; viz. that of 
Complutum, or Alcala de Henares; 
that of Venice, that of Rome, and that 
of Oxford. The first was published in 
1515 by cardinal Ximenes, and inserted 
in the Polyglot Bible, usually called tlie 
Complutensian Bible : this edition is 
not just, the Greek of the LXX being 
altered in many places according to 
the Hebrew text. It has, however, 
been reprinted in the Polyglot Bible cf 
Antwei-p, in that of Paris, and in the j 
quarto Bible commonly called Yata- j 



blus's Bible. The second Greek Bible 
is that of Venice, printed by Aldus in 
1518. Here the (ireek text of the 
Septuagint is reprinted just as it stood 
in the manuscript, full of faults of the 
copyists, but easily amended. This 
edition was reprinted at Strasburg in 
1526, at Basil in 1545, at Frankfort in 
1597, and otlier places, with some 
alterations, to bring it nearer the He- 
brew. The most commodious is that 
of Frankfort, there being added to this 
little scholia, which shew the ditFerent 
intei-pretations of the old Greek trans- 
lators. The author of this collection 
has not added his name, but it is com- 
monly ascribed to Junius. The third 
Greek Bible is that of Rome, or the 
Vatican, in 1587, with Greek scholia, 
collected from the manuscripts in the 
Roman libi-aries by Peter Morin. It 
was first set on foot by cardinal Mon- 
talbo, afterwal-ds pope Sixtus V. This 
fine edition has been reprinted at Paris 
in 1628, by J. Morin, priest of the 
Oratory, who lias added the Latin 
translation, which in the Roman was 
pi-inted separately with scholia. The 
Greek edition of Rome has been print- 
ed in the Polyglot Bible of London, to 
which are added at the bottom the 
various readings of the Alexandrian 
manuscript. This has been also re- 
printed in England, in 4to. and 12mo. 
with some alterations. It was again 
published at Franekei', in 1709, by Bos, 
who has added all the various read- 
ings he could find. The fourth Greek 
Bible is that done from the Alexan- 
drian manuscript begun at Oxford by 
Grabe in 1707. In this the Alexan- 
drian manuscript is not printed such 
as it is, but such as it was thought it 
should be, i. e. it is altered wherever 
there appeared any fault of the copy- 
ists, or any word inserted from any par- 
ticular dialect : this some think an ex- 
cellence, but others a, fault, urging that 
the manuscript should have been given 
absolutely and entirely of itself, and all 
conjectures as to the readings should 
have been thrown into the notes. We 
have many editions of the Greek Tes- 
tament by Erasmus, Stephens, Beza; 
that in "the Complutensian Polyglot, 
the Elzevirs, &amp;c.; and with various 
readings by Mill, Bengelius, Wetstein, 
&amp;c. "I*hose of Wetstein and Griesbach, 
are thought by some to exceed all the 
rest. 

30. Bibles, Hebrew, are either ma- 
nuscript or printed. The best manu- 
script Bibles are those copied by the 
Jews of Spain: those copied by the 
Jews of Germany are less exact, but

more common. The two kinds are 
easily distinguished from each otlier; 
the former being in beautiful charac- 
ters, like the Hebrew Bibles of Bom- 
berg, Stevens, and Plantin: the latter in 
characters like those of Munster and 
Gr)'phius. F. Simon observes, that 
the oldest manuscript Hebrew Bibles 
are not above six or seven hundred 
years old; nor does Rabbi Menaham, 
who quotes a vast' number of them, 
pretend that any one of them exceeds 
600 years. Dr. Kennicott, in his Dis- 
sertatio Gcneralis, prefixed to his He- 
brew Bible, p. 21, observes, that the 
most ancient manuscripts were Av^ritten 
between the years 900 and 1100; but 
though those that are the most ancient 
are not more than 800 or 900 years old, 
they were transcribed from others of a 
much more ancient date. The manu- 
scnpt preserved in the Bodleian Li- 
brary is not less than 800 years old. 
Another manuscript not less ancient, 
is preserved in the Cssarian Library 
at Vienna. The most ancient printed 
Hebrew Bibles are those published by 
the Jews of Italj', especially of Pesaro 
and Bresse. Those of Portugal also 
printed some parts of the Bible at Lis- 
Don before their expulsion. This may 
be observed in general, that the best 
Hebrew BHiles are those printed under 
the inspection of the Jews; there being 
so many minutia; to be observed in the 
Hebrew language, that it is scarcely 
possible for any other to succeed in it. 
In the beginning of the 16th century, 
Dan. Bomberg printed several Hebrew 
Bibles in folio and quarto at Venice, 
most of which were esteemed both by 
the Jews and Christians: the first in 
1517, which is the least exact, and 
generally goes by the name of Felix 
Pratensis, the person who revised it: 
this edition contains the Hebrew text, 
the Targum, and the commentaries of 
several rabbins. In 1528, Bomberg 
printed the folio Bible of rabbi Bencha- 
jim, with his preface, the masoretical 
divisions, a preface of Aben Ezra, a 
double masora, and several various 
readings. The third edition was print- 
ed, 1618, the same with the second, 
but much more correct. From the 
former editions, Buxtorf, the father, 
printed his rabbinical Hebrew Bible at 
Basil, in 1618 ; which, though there are 
many faults in it, is more correct than 
anv of the former. In 1623, appeared 
at Venice a new edition of the rabbini- 
cal Bible, by Leo of Modena, a rabbin 
of that city, who pretended to have 
corrected a gi'eat number of faults in 
the former edition ^i but, besides that, 



it is much inferior to the other Hebrew 
Bibles of Venice, with regard *o paper 
and print : it has passed through the 
hands of the Inquisitors, who have al- 
tered many passages in the commenta- 
ries of the Rabbins. Of Hebi-ew Bibles 
in quarto, that of R. Stephens is esteem- 
ed for the beauty of the characters : 
b\it it is very incorrect. Plantin also 
printed several beautiful Hebrew Bibles 
at Antwerp ; one in eight columns, with 
a preface by Arius Montanus, in 1571, 
which far exceeds the Complutensian 
in paper, print, and contents : this is 
called the Royal Bible, because it was 
printed at the expense of Philip II. 
king of Spain: another at Geneva, 
1619, besides many more of different 
sizes, with and without points. Manas- 
seh Ben Israel, a learned Portuguese 
Jew, published two editions of the He- 
brew Bible at Amsterdam ; one in 
quarto, in 1635 ; the other in octavo, m 
1639: the first has two columns, and 
for that reason is more commodious 
for the reader. In 1639, R. Jac. Lom- 
broso published a new edition in quarto 
at Venice, with small literal notes at 
the bottom of each page, where he ex- 
plains the Hebrew words by Spanish 
words. This Bible is much esteemed 
by the Jews at Constantinople : in the 
text they have distingxiished between 
words where the point camets is to be 
read with a camets katufih ; that is, by 
0, and not an a. Of all the editions 
of the Hebrew Bible in octavo, the 
most beautiful and coiTCct are the two 
of J. Athias, a Jew, of Amsterdam. 
The first, of 1661, is the best paper; 
but that of 1667 is the most exact. 
That, however, published since at Am- 
sterdam, by Vander Hooght, in 1705, 
is preferable to both. After Athias, 
three Hebraizuig Protestants engaged 
in revising and publishing the He- 
brew Bible, viz. Clodius, Jablonski, and 
Opitius. Clodius's edition was publish- 
ed at Frankfort, in 1677, in quarto : at 
the bottom of the pages it has the va- 
rious readings of the former editions : 
laut the author does not appear suffi- 
ciently versed in the accenting, espe- 
cially' in the poetical books; besides, as 
it was not published under his eye, many 
faults have crept in. That of Jablonski, 
in 1699, in quarto, at Berlin, is ven- 
beautiful as to letter and print; but, 
though the editor pretends he made 
use of the editions of Athias and Clo- 
dius, some critics find it scarcely- in 
any thing different from the quarto 
edition of Bomberg. That of Opitius 
is also in quarto, at Keil, in 1709 : the 
'character is large and good, but the 



BIB

BIB 



paper bad : it is done with a gi'eat deal 
of care ; but the editor made use of no 
manuscripts but those of the German 
libraries, neglecting the French ones, 
■which is an omission common to all the 
three. They have this advantage, how- 
ever, that, besides the divisions used by 
the Jews, both general and particular, 
into fiaraskes and pesukim, they have 
also those of the Christians, or of the 
Latin Bibles, into chapters and verses ; 
the keri kctlb, or various readings, La- 
tin summaries, 8cc. which made them 
of considei'able use with resj^ect to the 
Latin editions and the concordances. 
The little Bible of R. Stevens, in 16mo. 
is very much prized for the beauty of 
the character. Care, however, must 
be taken, there being another edition 
of Geneva exceedingly hke it, except- 
ing that the print is worse, and the text 
less correct. To these may be added 
some other Hebrew Bibles without 
poii\ts, in 8vo. and 24mo. v/hich are 
much coveted by the Jews; not that 
they are more exact, but more portable 
than the rest, and are used in their 
synagogues and schools. Of these there 
are two beautiful editions ; the one of 
Plantin, in 8vo. witli two columns, and 
the other in 24mo. reprinted by Rapha- 
lengius, at Leyden, in 1610. Thei-e is 
also an edition of them by Laurens, at 
Amsterdam, in 1631, in a larger cha- 
racter; and another in 12mo. at Frank- 
fort, in 1694, fidl of faults, with a j) re- 
face of Mr. Leusden at tl\e head of it. 
Houbigant pul)lished an elegant edition 
of the Hebrew Bible at Paris, in 1753, 
in 4 vols, folio : the text is that of Van- 
der Hooght, \vithout points; to which 
he has added marginal notes, supplying 
the variations of the Samaritan copy. 
Dr. Kennicott, after almost twenty 
years' laborious collation of near 600 co- 
pies, manuscripts and printed, either of 
the whole or ])articular parts of the 
Bible, published the Hebrew Bible in 2 
vols, folio : the text is that of Everard 
Vander Hooght, already mentioned, dif- 
fering from it only in the disposition of 
the jjoetical parts, which Dr. Kennicott 
has printed in hemistichs, into which 
they naturally divide themselves; how- 
ever, the words follow one another in 
the same order as they do in the edition 
of Vander Hooght. ' This edition is 
printed on an excellent type : the Sa- 
maritan text, according to" the copy in 
the London Polyglot, is exhibited in a 
column parallcrwith the Hebrew text; 
those parts of it only being inti-oduced i, 
in which it differs from the Hebrew. ; 
The numerous variations, lioth of the r 
SamaritaJi manuscript from the printed \\ 



copy of the Samaritan texts, and of the 
Hebrew manuscripts from the printed 
text of Vander Hooght, are placed se- 
parately at the bottom of the page, and 
markedl with numbers referring to the 
copies from which they are taken. Four 
quarto volumes of various readings have 
also been published by De Rossi, of 
I Parma, from more than 400 manuscripts 
I (some of which are said to be of the 
seventh or eighth century,) as well as 
from a considerable number of rare 
and unnoticed editions. An edition of 
I Reineccius's Hebrev/ Bible, with read- 
ings from Kennicott and De Rossi, has 
been published by Dodderlein, and will 
be found a useful work to the Hebrew 
student. 

31. Bibles, Italian. The first Ita- 
lian Bible published by the Romanists 
is that of Nicholas Maleme, a Bene- 
dictine monk, printed at Venice in 1471. 
It was translated from the Vul');ate. 
The version of Anthony Brucbli, jjub- 
lished at Venice in 1532,' was prohibited 
by the council of Trent. The Calvin- 
ists likewise have their Italian Bibles. 
There is one of John Diodati in 1607 
And 1641 ; and another of Maximus 
Theophilus, in 1551, dedicated to Fran- 
cis de Medicis, duke of Tuscany. The 
Jews of Italy have no entire version of 
the Bible in Italian ; the Inquisition con- 
stantly refusing to allow them the li- 
berty of printing one. 

32. Bibles, Latin, however nu- 
merous, may be all reduced to three 
classes ; the ancient Vulgate, called 
also Itidica, translated from the Greek 
Septuagint ; the modern Vulgate, the 
greatest part of which is done from the 
Hebrew text; and the new Latin trans- 
lations, done also from the Hebrew 
text, in the sixteenth century. We 
have nothing remaining of the ancient 
Vulgate, used in the primitive times in 
the western churches, but the Psalms, 
Wisdom, and Ecclesiastes. Nobilius 
has endeavoured to retrieve it from the 
works of the ancient Latin fathers ; but 
it was impossible to do it exactly, be- 
cause most of the fathers did not keep 
close to it in their citations. As to the 
modern Vulgate, there are a vast num- 
ber of editions very different from each 
other. Cardinal Ximenes has inserted 
one in the Bible of Complutum, correct- 
ed and altered in many places. R. Ste- 
vens, and the doctors of Louvain, have 
taken great pains in correcting the mo- 
dern Vulgate. The best edition of Ste- 
vens's Latin Bible is tiiat of 1540, re- 
printed 1545, in which are added on 
the margin the various readings of se- 
veral Latin nkanuicripts which lie had 



BIB 



63 



roiisulted. The doctors of Louvain re- 
vised the modern Vulgate after R. Ste- 
vens, and added the various readings of 
several Latin manuscripts. The best 
of the Louvain editions are those in 
which are added the critical notes of 
Francis Lucas, of Bruges. All these 
reformations of the Latin Bil)le were 
made before the time of pope Sixtus V. 
and Clement VIII. ; since which people 
have not presumed to make any altera- 
tions, excepting in comments and sepa- 
rate notes. The correction of Clement 
VIIL in 1592, is now the standard 
throughout all the Romish churches: 
that pontiff made two reformations ; 
but it is the first of them that is follow- 
ed. From this the Bibles of Plantin 
were done, and ivofn those of Plantin 
all the rest ; so that the common Bibles 
have none of the after-corrections of 
the same Clement VIII. It is a heavy 
charge that lies on the editions of pope 
Clement, viz. that they have some new 
texts added, and many old ones altered, 
to coiuitenance and confirm what they 
call the catholic doctrine. There are 
a great number of Latin Bibles of the 
third class, comprehending the versions 
from the originals of the sacred books 
made within these 200 years. The first 
is that of Santes Pagninus, a Dominican, 
under the patronage of Leo X. printed 
at Lyons, in quarto, in 1527, much es- 
teemed by the Jews. This the author 
improved in a second edition. In 1542 
there was a beautiful edition of the same 
at Lvons, in folio, with scholia published 
under the name of Michael Villanova- 
nus, i. e. Michal Servetus, author of 
the scholia. Those of Zurich, have like- 
wise published an edition of Pagninus's 
Bible in quarto; and R. Stevens re- 
printed it in folio, with the Vulgate, in 
1557, pretending to give it more correct 
than in tlie former editions. There is 
also anotlier edition of 1586, in four 
columns, under the name of Vatablus ; 
and we find it again, in the Hamburg 
edition of the Bible, in four languages. 
In the number of Latin Bibles is also 
usually ranked the version of the same 
Pagninus, corrected or rather rendered 
literal, by Arias Montanus ; which cor- 
rection being approved of by tlie doc- 
tors of Louvain, &amp;c. was inserted in the 
Polyglot Bible of Philip II. and since in 
that of London. There have been va- 
rious editions of this in folio, quatto, 
and octavo ; to which have been added 
the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, 
and tlie Greek of the New. The best 
of them all is the first, which is in folio, 
1571. Since the reformation, there have 
been several Latin versions of the Bible 



BIB 

from the originals by Protestants. The 
most esteemed are' those of Munster, 
Leo Juda, Castalio, and Tremellius; 
the three last of which have been re- 
printed various times. Munster japb- 
lisherl his version at Basil in 1534, ^4nch 
he afterwards revised : he published a 
correct edition in 1546. Castalio's fine 
Latin pleases most people ; but there 
are some who think it aftected : the best 
edition is that in 1573. Leo Juda's ver- 
sion, altered a little by the divines of 
Salamanca, was added to the ancient 
Latin edition, as published by R. Ste- 
vens, with notes, imder the name of 
Vatablus's Bible, in 1545. It was con- 
demned by the Parisian divines, but 
printed, with some alterations, bv the 
Spanish divines of Salamanca. Those 
ot Junius, Tremellius, and Beza, ai'e 
considerably exact, and liave undergone 
a great number of editions. We may 
add a fourth class of Latin Bibles, com- 
prehending the Vulgate edition, cor- 
rected from the oiiginals. The Bible 
of Isidorus Clarus is of this number; 
that author, not contented with re- 
storing the ancient Latin copy, has cor- 
rected t!\e translator in a great number 
of places which he thought ill rendered. 
Some Protestants have followed the 
same metliod ; and, among others, An- 
drew and Luke Osiander, who have 
each published a nev&gt;f edition of the 
Vulgate, corrected from the originals.

and 39. 

34 Bibles, Oriental. See Nos. 12, 
13, 15, 19, 20, 23, 35, 41, 42. 

o5. Bibles, Persian. Some of the 
fathers seem to say that all the Scrfp- 
ture was formerly translated into the 
language of the Persians ; but we have 
nothing now remaining of the ancient 
version, which was certainly done from 
the Septuagint. The Persian Penta- 
teuch, ]jrinted in the London Polyglot, 
is without doubt, the work of rabbi Ja- 
cob, a Persian Jew. It was published 
by the Jews at Constantinople in 1551. 
In the same Polvglot we ha\e likewise 
the four evangelists in Persian, with a 
Latin translation ; but this appears very 
modern, incorrect, and of little use. 
W^alton says, this version was v/ritten 
above four hundred years ago. Another 
version of the Gospels was published at 
Cambridge by Wheloc, in the seven- 
teenth century. There are also two 
Persian versions of the Psahns made 
from the vulgar Latin. 

36. Bibles, Po/M. The first Polish 
version of the Bible,. it is said, was that 
composed bv Hadewich, wife of Jagel- 
Ion, duke of Lithuania, who embrace?!

Chrlstjanity in the year 1390. In 1599 
there was a Polish translation of the 
Bible published at Cracow, which was 
tlie work of several divines of that na- 
tigo^ and in which James Wieck, a Je- 
su^piad a principal share. The Pro- 
testants, in 1596, published a Polish Bi- 
ble from Luther's German version, and 
dedicated it to Uladislaus, fourth king 
of Poland. 

37. Bibles, Polyglot. See Nos. 
29, 31. 

38. Bibles, Bussian ; or, 

39. Bibles, Sclavoiiian. The Rus- 
sians or Muscovites, published the Bible 
in their language in 1581. It was trans- 
lated from the Greek by St. Cyril, the 
apostle of the Sclavonians ; but this old 
version being too obscure, Ernest Gliik, 
who had been carried prisoner to Mos- 
cow after the taking of Narva, under- 
took a new translation of the Bible into 
Sclavonian ; who dying in 1705, the 
Czar Peter appointed some particular 
divines to finish the translation ; but 
whether it was ever printed we cannot 
say. 

40. Bibles, Spanish. The first Spa- 
nish Bible that we hear of, is that men- 
tioned by Cyprian de Valera, which he 
says was published about 1500. The 
epistles and Gospels were pViblished in 
that language by Ambrose de Montesian 
in 1512; the whole Bible by Cassiodore 
de Reyna, a Calvinist, in 1569 ; and the 
New Testament, dedicated to the em- 
peror Charles V., by Francis Enzina, 
otherwise called Driander, in 1543. 
The first Bible which was printed in 
Spanish for tlie use of the Jews was that 
printed at Ferrara in 1553, in Gothic 
characters, and dedicated to Hercules 
D'Este, duke of Ferrara. This version 
is very ancient, and was probably in use 
among the Jews of Spain before Ferdi- 
nand and Isabella expelled them out of 
their dominions in 1492. After very 
violent opposition from the catholic 
clergv, the court of Spain ordered Spa- 
nish Bibles to be printed by royal autho- 
rity in 1796, and put into the hands of 
people of all ranks, as well as to be 
used in public worship. 

41. Bibles, Sijriac. There are ex- 
tant two versions of the Old Testament 
in the Syriac language ; one from the 
Septuagint, which is ancient, and made 
probably about the time of Constantine: 
the other called antiqua et mmplex, 
made from the Hebrew, as some sup- 
pose, about the time of the apostles. 
This version is printed in the Polyglots 
of London and Paris. In 1562, Wed- 
manstadius printed-the whole New Tes- 
tament in Svriac, at Vienna, in a beau- 



tiful character: and since his time there 
have been several other editions. Ga- 
briel Sionita published a beautiful Sj'^riac 
edition of the Psalms at Paris in 1526, 
with a Latin intei-pretation. There is a 
Syriac copy of the Bible written in the 
Estrayigelo character, and was brought 
from the Christians of Travancore, 
being a present from Mar Dionysius, 
the resident bishop at Cadenatte to Dr. 
Buchanan. The size is large folio in 
parchment: the pages are written in 
three columns, each column containing 
sixty lines. It is supposed to have 
been written about the seventh century. 
Dr. White, it is said, has for some time 
been engaged in reprinting the Syriac 
Old Testament. 

42. Bibles, Turkish. In 1666 a 
Turkish New Testament was printed 
in London to be dispersed in the East. 
In 1721, it is said, the grand Seignor 
ordered an impression of Bibles at Con- 
stantinople, that they might be con- 
trasted with Mahomet's oracle, the Al- 
coran. The modern Greeks in Turkey 
have also a translation of the Bible in 
their language. 

43. Bibles, Welch. There was a 
Welch translation of the Bible made 
from the original in the time of queen 
Elizabeth, in consequence of a bill 
brought into the House of Commons 
for this pm-pose in 1563: it was printed 
in folio in 1588. Another version, which 
is the standard translation for that lan- 
guage, was printed in 1 620 : it is called 
Parry's Bible. An impression of this 
was printed in 1690, called Bishop 
Lloyd's Bible: these were in folio. 
The first octavo impression of the 
Welch Bible was made in 1 630. 

44. Bibles, Bengalee. It is with 
pleasure we add to all the above ac- 
counts, that a translation of the New 
Testament mto the Shanscrit, and the 
last volume of the Bengalee Bible are 
now completed, by the missionaries re- 
sident in that part. 

Much has been done by the British 
and Foreign Bible Society, in printing 
new editions of the Scriptures in various 
languages. The reader will find much 
pleasing infonnation on the subject, in 
the Annual Reports of that Society.

BIO 



BIBLIOMANCY, a kind of divina- 
tion performed by means of the Bible. 
It consisted in talcing passages of Scrip- 
ture at hazard, and drawing indications 
thence concerning things future. It 
wae muc'n vised at the consecration of 
bishops. F. J. Davidiiis, a Jesuit, has 
published a bibliomane.^ under the bor- 
rowed name of Veridicus C-hristianus. 
It has been affirmed that some well- 
meaning people practise a kind of bi- 
bliomane}" widi respect to the future 
state of their souls; and, when they 
ha' e happened to nx on a text of an 
awful nature, it has almost driven them 
to despair. It certainly is not the way 
to know the mind of God by choosing 
detached parts of Scripture, or by 
drawing a card on v/hich a passage may 
be written, the sense of which is to be 
gathered only from the context.- 

BIDDELI.VNS, so called from John 
Biddlc, who in the year 1644 formed an 
independent congregation in London. 
He taught that Jesus Christ, to the in- 
tent that he might be our brother, and 
have a fellow-feeling of our infirmities, 
and so become the more ready to help 
us, hath no other than a human nature; 
and therefore in this very nature is not 
only a person, since none but a human 

Eerson can be our brother, but also our 
lOrd and God. 

Biddle, as well as Socinus and other 
Unitarians l)efore and since, m.ade no 
sciniple of calling Christ God, though 
he believed him to be a human creature 
only, on account of the di\'ine sovereign- 
ty with which he was invested. 

BIDDING PRAYER. It was pait 
of the office of the deacons in the pri- 
mitive church to be monitors and di- 
rectors of the people in their public 
devotions in the church. To this end 
they made use of certain known forms 
of words, to give notice when each ]3art 
of the service began. Agi-eeable to this 
ancient practice is the form "Let us 
pray," repeated before several of the 
prayers in the English liturgv. Bishop 
Buf.iet, in his History of the Reforma- 
tion, vol. ii. p. 20, lias preserved the 
form as it was in use before the refor- 
mation, which was this: — After the 
p!-eacher had named and opened his 
text, he called on the people to go to 
their prayers, telling then) what they 
were to pray for : Ve shall pray, says 
he, for the king, the pope, &amp;C. ' After 
which, all the people said their beads 
in a general silence, and the minister 
kneeled down likewise, and said his: 
they were to saj^ a paternoster, ax&gt;e 
marla, &amp;c. and then the sermon pro- 
ceeded. 



BIGOTRY consists in being obsti- 
nately and perx'ersely attached to our 
own opinions ; or, as some have defined 
it, "a tenacious adherence to a system 
adopted without in\estigation, and de- 
fended without argumcr.t, accompanied 
with a malignant intolerant spirit to- 
wards all who differ." It must be dis- 
tinguished from love to truth, which 
inhueuces a man to embrace it where- 
evcr he finds it; and from true zeal, 
which is an ardour of mind exciting its 
possessor to defend and propagate the 
principles he maintains. Bigotry is a 
kind of prejudice coi"nbined with a cer- 
tain degree of malignity. It is thus ex- 
emplified and distinguished by a sensible 
writer. "When Jesus preached, pre- 
judice cried, Can any good thing come 
out of Nazareth ? Crucify him, crucify 
hirn, said bigotry. Why.' what evil 
hath he done * replied candour." Bi- 
gotry is mostly prevalent with those 
who are ignorant ; who have taken up 
principles without due examination ; 
and v;ho are naturally of a morose and 
contracted disposition. It is often mani- 
fested more in unimportant sentiments, 
or the circumstantials of religion, than 
the essentials of it. Simple bigotry is 
the spirit of persecution without the 
power ; persecution is bigotry armed 
with power, and carrying its will ir.to 
act. As it is the effect of ignorance, so 
it is the nurse of it, because it precludes 
free enquiry, and is an enemy to truth : 
it cuts also the very sinews of charity, 
and destroys moderation and mutual 
good will. If \&lt;'e consider the different 
makes of men's minds,, our own igno- 
rance, the liberty that aft men have to 
think for themselves, the admirable 
example our Lord has set us of a con- 
trary spirit, and the baneful effects of 
this disposition, we must at once be 
convinced of its impropriety. Hov/ 
contradictory is it to sound reason, anci 
how inimical to the peaceful religion 
we profess to maintain as Christians ! —

BISHOP, a prelate consecrated for 
the spiritual gOA-ei-nmeiit of a diocese. 
The word comes from the Saxon bis- 
chofi, and that from the Greek i'a-io-ii:,'BrK, 
an overseer, or inspector. It is a long 
time since bishops have been distin- 
guished from mere priests, or presby- 
ters ; but whether that distinction be of 
divine or human right ; whether it was 
settled in the apostolic age, or inti-o- 
■ duced since, is much controverted. 
Churchmen in general plead for the 
divine right ; while the Dissenters sup- 
pose that the Avord no where signifies 
more than a pastor or pi'esbyter; the 
very same pei^ons being called bishops 
and elders, oir presbyters, Acts xx. 17, 
28. 1 Pet. V. 1, 3. Tit. i. 5, 7. Phil. i. 1. 
See Episcopacy. All the bishops of 
England are jjeers of the realm, except 
the bishop of Man ; and as such sit and 
vote in the house of lords. Besides two 
archbishops, there are twenty-four 
bishops" in England, exclusive of tlie 
bishop of Sodor and Man. The bishops 
of London, Durham, and Winchester, 
take the precedence of the ptlier bi- 
shops, who rank after them according 
to their seniority of consecration. See 
Episcopacy. 

BLASPHEMY, fi-om Bxair^i),^/*, ac- 
cording to Dr. Campbell, properly de- 
notes calumn)% detraction, reproachful 
or abusive language, against whomso- 
ever it be vented. It is in Scripture 
applied to reproaches not aimed against 
God only, but man also, Rom. hi. 8. 
Horn. xiv. 16.-1 Pet. iv. 4. Gr. It is, 
however, more peculiarly restrained to 
evil or reproacnful words oflFered to 
God. ^Accol•ding to Liiiwood, bias- [ 



phemy is an injury offered to God, by 
denymg that whicli is due and belong- 
ing to him, or attributing to him what 
is not agreeable to his nature. " Three 
things,' says a divine, " are essential to 
this crime ; 1. God must be the object. 
— 2. I'he words sjioken or written, in- 
dependent of consequences whicli others 
may derive from them, must be inju- 
rious in their nature. — And, 3. He who 
commits the crime must do it knowing- 
ly. This is real blasphemy ; but there 
is a relative blasphemy, as when a man 
may be guilty ignorant ly by propa- 
gating opinions which dishonour God, 
the tendency of which he does not pei'- 
ceive. A man may be guilty of this 
constructively : for if he speak freely 
against received errors, it will be con- 
strued into blasjjhemy." By the English 
laws, blasphemies of God, as den)'ing 
his being or providence, and all contu- 
melious reproaches of Jesus Christ, &amp;c. 
are offences by the common law, and' 
punishable by fine, imprisonment, and 
pillory ; and, by the statute law, he that 
denies one of the persons in the Tri- 

j nity, or asserts that there are more 
than one God, or denies Christianity to 
be true, for the first offence is rendered 
incapable of any office ; for the second, 
adjudged incapable of suing, being ex- 
ecutor or giiatdian, receiving any gift 
or legacy, and to be imprisoned for 
years. According to the law of Scot- 
land, blasphemy is punished with death : 
these laws, however, in the present 
age, are not enforced; the legislature 

I thinking, perliaps, that spiritual oficnccs 
should be left to be punished by the 
Deity rather than by human statutes.

BOGOMILI, or Bogarmit^,, a sect 
of heretics which arose about the year 
1179. They held that the use of 
churches, of the sacrament of the 
Lord's suppei-, and all prayer except 
the Lord's prayer, ought to be abolish- 
ed ; tliat the baptism of Catholics is 
imperfect ; that the persons of the Tri-

their sect. 

BOHEMIAN BRETHREN, a sect 
of Christian reformers which sprung up 
in Bohemia in the year 1467. They 
treated the pope and cardinals as anti- 
christ, and the church of Rome as the 
whore spoken of in the Revelations.

riicy rejected the sacraments of the 
Romish cliurch, and chose laymen for 
their ministers. They held the Scrip- 
tures to be the only rule of faith, and 
rejected the popish ceremonies in the 
celebration ot the mass; nor did they 
make use of any other prayei* than the 
Lord's prayer. They consecrated lea- 
vened bread. They allowed no adora- 
tion but of Jesus Christ in the commu- 
nion. They rebaptized all such as joined 
themselves to their con^'cgation. They 
abhorred the worship of saints ajid 
images, prayers for the dead, celiba- 
cies, vows, and fasts ; and kept none of 
the festivals but Christmas, Easter, and 
Whitsuntide. 

In 1503 they were accused by the Ca- 
tholics to king Ladislaus II., who pub- 
lished an edict against them, forbidding 
them to hold an\' meetings, either pri- 
vately or publicly. V^'hen Luther de- 
clared himself against the church of 
Ron)c, the Bohemian brethren endea- 
voured to join his party. At first, thatj 
reformer showed a great aAersion to 
them ; but, the Bohemians sending their 
deputies to him in 1535, with a full ac- 
count of their doctrines, he acknow- 
ledged that they were a society of Chris- 
tians whose doctrine came nearest to 
the purity of the Gospel. This sect pub- 
lished another confession of faith in 1535, 
in which they renounced anabaptisrn, 
which they at first practised: upon 
which a union was concluded with the 
Lutherans, and afterv/ards with the 
Zuinglians, whose opinions from thence- 
forth thev continued to follow.

BORRELLISTS, a Christian sect in 
Holland, so named from their founder 
Borrel, a man of great learning in the 
Hebrew, Greek, and Latin tongues. 
They reject the use of the sacraments, 
public prayer, and all other external 
acts of worship. They assert that all 
the Christian churches of the world 
have degenerated from the pure apos- 
tolic doctrines, because thev have suf- 
fered the word of God, which is infalli- 
ble, to be expounded, or rather conaipt- 
ed, by doctors who are fallible. They 
lead a very austere life, and employ a 
great part of their goods in alms. 

BOURIGNONISTS, the followers 
of Antoinette Bourignon, a lady in 
France, who pretended to particular 
inspirations.' She was born at Lisle in 
1616. At her birth she Avas so deform- 
ed, that it was debated some da^-s in the 
family whether it was not proper to 
stifle licr as a monster ; but, her defor- 
mity diminishing, she was spared: and 
afterwards obtained sucli a degree of 



beauty, that she had her admirers. 
From her childhood to her old age she 
had an extraordinary turn of mind. 
She set up for a reformer, and publish- 
ed a great numljer of books filled with 
very singular notions; the most re- 
markable of which are entitled, The 
Light of the World, wA The Testimony 
of Truth. In her confession of faith, 
s'he professes her belief in the Scrip- 
tures, the divinity and atonement of 
Christ. She believed also that man is 
perfectly free to resist or receive divine 
grace ; that God is ever unchangeable 
io\e towards all his creatures, ^nd does 
not inflict any arbitrary punishment ; 
but that the evils they suffer are the 
natural consequence of sin ; that reli- 
gion consists not in outward forms of 
worship nor systems of faith, but in an 
entire resignation to the will of God. 
She held many extravagant notions, 
among which, it is said, she asserted 
that Adam, before the fall, possessed 
the principles of both sexes ; that in an 
ecstacy, God represented Adam to her 
mind in his original state ; as also the 
beauty of the first world, and how he 
had drawn from it the chaos ; and that 
every thine was bright, transparent, 
and darted forth life and ineffiible gloiy, 
with a number of other wild ideas. She 
dressed like a hermit, and travelled 
through France, Holland, England, and 
Scotland. She died at Fanekir, in the 

SrovLnce of Frise, October 30, 16S0,

BOYLE'S LECTURES, a course of 
eight se»'mons, preached annually ; set 
on foot by the honourable R. Boyle, by 
a codicil annexed to his will, in 169i, 
whose design, as expressed by the m- 
stitutor, is to prove the tnitli of the 
Christian religion against infidels, with- 
out descending to any controversies 
among Christians, and to answer new 
difficulties, scniples, &amp;c. For the sup- 
port of this lecture he assigned the rent 
of his house in Crooked Lane to some 
learned divine v/ithin the bills of mor- 
tality, to Ik? elected for a term not ex- 
ceeding three years. But, the fund 
proving precarious, the salaiy was ill 
paid ; to remedy which inconvenience, 
archbishop Tennison procured a 3-early 
.stipend of 501. for ever, to be paid quar- 
terly, cliarged on a farm in the parish 
of Brill, in the county of Bucks. To 
this appointment we are indebted for 
many excellent defences of natural and 
revealed religion.

BRETHREN AND SISTERS OF 
THE FREE SPIRIT, an appellation 
assumed by a sect which sprimg up to- 
wards the close of the thirteenth cen- 
tury, and gained many adhei'ents in 
Italy, France, and Germany. They 
took their denomination from the Avords 
of St. Paul, Rom. viii. 2, 14. and main- 
tained that the true children of God 
were in\'ested wkh perfect freedom 
from the jurisdiction of the law. They 
held that all things flowed by emanation 
fi'om God ; that rational souls were por- 
tions of the Deit\' ; that the universe 
was God ; and that by the power of 
contemplation they were united to the 
Deity, and acquired hereby a glorious 
and sublime liberty, both from the sin- 
ful lusts and tlie common instincts of 
nature, with a variety of other enthusi- 
astic notions. Many edicts were pub- 
lished against them ; but they continued 
till about the middle of the fifteenth 
centurv. 

BRETHREN AND CLERKS OF 
THE C0M:-I0N LIFE, a denomina- 
tion assumed by a religious fraternity 
towards the end of the fifteentli cen- 
tury. They lived under the rule of St. 
Augustin, and were said to be eminent- 
ly useful m promoting the cause of re- 
ligion and learning. 

BRETHREN AVHITE, were the 
followers of a priest from the Alps 
about the beg'mning of the fifteenth 
century. Tliey and their leader were 
arrayed in wiiite garments. Their lead- 
er carried about a cross like a standard. 
His apparent sanctity and devotion 
drew togetlier a numljer of followers. 
This deluded enthusiast practised many 
acts of mortification and penance, and 
endeavoured to persuade the Europeans 
to renew the holy war. Boniface IX. 
ordered liim to be apprehended, and 
committed to the flames ; upon which 
his followers dispersed.

BRIDGETINS, or Brigittins, an 
order denominated from St. Bridgit, or 
Birgit, a Swedisli lady, in the fourteenth 
century. Their rule is nearlv that of 
Augustin. The Brigittins profess great 
iTdortification, poverty, and self-denial ; 
and they are not to possess any thing 
they can call their own, not so iimeh .is 
aa halfpenny ; nor even to touch money 



on any account. This order spread 
much through Sweden, Germany, and 
the Netherlands. In England we read 
of but one monastery of Brigittins, and 
this built by Henry V. in 1415, opposite 
to Richmond, now called Sion House ; 
the ancient inhabitants of which, since 
the dissolution, are settled at Lisbon. 

BRIEFS, (apostolical) are letters 
wliich the pope dispatches to princes 
and other magistrates concerning any 
public affair. 

BROTHERS, Lay, among the Ro- 
manists, are illiterate persons, who de- 
vote themselves in some convent to the

BROWNISTS, a sect that arose 
among the puritans towaixls the close of 
the sixteenth century ; so named from 
their leader, Robert Brown. He was 
educated at Cambridge, and was a man 
of good parts and some learning. He 
began to inveigh openly against the ce- 
remonies of the churcli, at Norwich, in 
15S0 ; l)ut, being much opposed by the 
bkliops, lie with his congregation left 
England, and settled at Middleburgh, 
in Zealand, where they obtained leave 
to worship God in their own way, and 
fonn a church according to their own 
model. Thev soon, however, began to 
differ among themselves ; so that Brown, 
growing weary of his office, returned to 
England in 1589, renounced his prin- 
ciples of separation, and was preferred ■ 
to the rectory of a church in Northamp- 
tonshire. He died in prison in 1630. 
The revolt of Brown was attended with 
the dissolution of the church at Middle- 
burgh ; but the seeds of Brownism which 
he had sown in E'.ieland were so far 
from being destroyed, that Sir Walter 
Raleigh, in a speech in 1592, computes 
no less than 20,000 of this sect. 

The articles of their faith seem to be 
nearlv the same as those of the church 
of England. The occasion of their se- 
paration was not, therefore, any fault 
they found with the faith, but only with 
the discipline and form of government 
of the churches in England. They 
equally charged corruption on the epis- 
copal and presbvterian forms ; nor 
would they join with any other reform- 
ed church, because they Avere not as- 
sured of tlie sanctity and regeneration 
of the members that composed it. They 
condemned the solemn celebration of 
marriages in the church, maintaining 
that matrimony being a ])olitical con- 
tract, the confirmation thereof ought to 
come from the civil magistrate ; an opi- 
nion in which they are not singular. 
Thev wo\dd not allow tiie children of

to be baptized. They rejected all foi-ms j 
of prayer, and held that the Lord's 
prayer was not to be recited as a pray- 
er, being only given for a rule or model j 
whereon all our prayers are to be form- j 
ed. Their form of church government j 
was nearly as follows. ^Vhen a church 
was to be gathered, such as desired to 
be members of it made a confession of 
their faith in the presence of each other, 
and signed a covenant, by which they 
obliged themseh es to walk together in 
the order of the Gospel. The whole 

Eower of admitting and excluding mem- 
ers, Avith the decision of all controver- 
sies, was lodged in the brotherhood. 
Their church officers were chosen from 
among themsehes, and separated to 
their several offices by fastmg, prayer, 
and imposition of hands. But they did 
not allow the priesthood to be any dis- 
tinct order. x\s the vote of the brethren 
made a man a minister, so the same 
power could discharge him from his 
office, and reduce him to a mere lay- 
man again ; and as they maintained the 
bounds of a church to be no greater 
than what could meet together in one 
place, and join in one communion, so 
the power of these officers was pre- 
scribed within the same limits. — The 
minister of one church could not ad- 
minister the Lord's supper to another, 
nor baptize the children of any but those 
of his own society. Any lay brother 
was allowed the liberty of gi\ing a word 
of exhortation to the people; and it was 
usual for some of them after sermon to 
ask questions, and reason upon the doc- 
trines that had been preached. In a 
word, every cliurch on their model is a 
body coijjorate, having full power to do 
every thing in themselves, without being 
accountable to any class, synod, convo- 
cation, or other jurisdiction whatever. 
The reader will judge how near the 
Independent churches are allied to this 
form of government. See Indepen- 
dents. — ^^riie laws were executed with 
great severity on the Brownists ; their 
books were prohibited by queen Eliza- 
beth, their persons imprisoned, and 
some hanged. Brown himself declared 
on his deatli-bed that he had been m 
thirty-two different prisons, in somigfc of 
which he could not see his hand at 
noon-day. They were so much perse- 
cuted, that they resolved at last to quit 
the country. Accordingly many retired 
and settled at Amsterdam, whei-e they 
formed a church, and chose Mr. Johnson 
their pastor, and after him Mr. Ains- 
worth, autlior of the learned Commen- 
taiy on the Pentateuch. Their church 
flourished neav 100 years. Among the 



Brownists, too, were the famous John 
Robinson, a part of %vhose congregation 
from Leyden, in Holland, made tne first 
permanent settlement m North Ameri- 
ca; and the laborious Canne, the au- 
thor of the marginal references to the 
Bible. 

BUCHANITES, a sect of enthusi- 
asts who sprung up in the west of Scot- 
land about 1783, and took their name 
from a Mrs. Buchan, of Glasgow, who 
gave herself out to be the woman spo- 
ken of in the Revelations ; and that all 
who believed in her should be taken up 
to heaven without tasting death, as the 
end of the woi'ld was near. They never 
increased much ; and the death of their 
leader within a year or two afterwards, 
occasioned their dispersion, by putting 
an end to their hopes of reaching the 
New Jerusalem without death. 

BUDN^ANS, a sect in Poland, who 
disclaimed the worship of Christ, and 
nm into many wild hypotheses. Bud- 
nxus, the founder, was publicly excom- 
municated in 1584, with all his disciples, 
but afterwards he was admitted to the 
communion of the Socinian sect. 

BULLS, Popish, are letters called 
apostolic by the Canonists, strengthened 
with a leaden seal, and containing in

BURGHER SECEDERS, a nume- 
rous and respectable class of dissenters 
from the church of Scotland, who were 
originally connected with the associate 
presbytery ; but, some difference of sen- 
timent arising about the lawfulness of 
taking the Burgess oath, a separation 
ensued in 1739; in consequence of which, 
those who pleaded for the affirmative 
obtained the appellation of Burgher, 
and their opponents that of Anti- 
burgher Seceders. See Seceders. 

BURIAL, the interment of a de- 
ceased person. The rites of burial 
have been looked upon in all countries 
as a debt so sacred, that such as ne- 
glected to discharge them were thought 
accursed. Among the Jews, the privi- 
lege of burial was denied only to self- 
murderers, wlio were thrown out to 
putrefy upon the ground. In the Chris- 
tian church, though good men always 
desired tlie privilege of interment, yet 
they were not, like the hcathcns,_ so 
conceiTied for their bodies, as to think 
!| it any detriment to them if either the 
|l barbarity of an enemy, or some other 
1 1 accident, deprived tliem of this pi'ivi- 
I lege. The primitive church denied the 
j{ more solemn rites of burial only to un- 
Ij baptized persons, sclf-murdei-ers, and 
[[ excommunicated pcrsonsj who con-

vinued obstinate and impenitftnt in a 
manifest contempt of the chiu-ch's cen- 
sui'es. The place of burial among the 
Jews was never particularly determin- 
ed. W^e find they had graAes in the 
town and country, upon the highway or 
gardens, and upon mountains. Among 
the Greeks, the temples were made re- 
positoi'ies for the dead, in the primitive 
ages; yet, in the latter ages, the Greeks 
as well as the Romans buried the dead 
without the cities, and chiefly bv the 
highways. Among the primitive Chris- 
tians, burying in cities was not allowed 
for the first three hundred years, nor 
in churches for many ages after; the 
dead bodies being first deposited in the 
atrium or church-yard, and porches and 
porticos of the church : hereditar}" bu- 



rying-places were forbidden till the- 
twelfth century. See Funeral Rites. 
As to burying in churches, we find a 
diiFerence of opinion: some have thought 
it improper that dead bodies should be 
interred in the church. Sir Matthew 
Hale used to say, that church.es were 
for the living, and church-yards for the 
dead. In the famous Bishop Hall's will 
we find this passage : after desiring a 
private funeral, he says, " I do not hold 
God's house a meet repository for the 
dead bodies of thegreatest saints." Mr. 
Hervey, on the contrary, defends it, 
and sujjposes that it tends to render our 
assembles more awful; and that, as 
the bodies of the saints are the Lord's 
property, they should be reposed in his 
house. 



c 



CABBALA, a Hebrew word, signi- 
fying tradition : it is used for a myste- 
rious kind of science pretended to have 
been delivered by re\'elation to the an- 
cient Jews, and transmitted by oral tra- 
dition to those of our times ; s'erving for 
intei-pretation of the- books both of na- 
ture and Scripture. 

CABBALISTS, the Jewish doctors 
who profess the study of the caljbala. 
The}- study principally the combination 
of particular words, letters, and num- 
bers ; and by this, they sa)-, they see 
clearly into the sense of Scripture. In 
their opiRion, there is not a word, letter, 
number, or accent, in the law, without 
some mystery in it; and they even pre- 
tend to discover what is future by this 
vain study. 

Dr. Smith has given us the following 
description of tlie Cabbalistic rabbies. 

The}' liave employed the al)ove me- 
thods of interpretation, which have ren- 
dered the Scripture a convenient in- 
strument of subserviency to any pur- 
pose which they might choose. Disre- 
garding the continuity of subject, and 
the harmony of parts, in any Scriptural 
composition, they selected sentences, 
and broken pieces of sentences, and 
even single words and detached letters; 
and these they proposed to the igno- 
rant and abused multitude as the an- 
nunciations of truth and authority. To 
ascertain the native sense of the sacred 
writers, however momentous and valu- 
able, was no object of their desire. At- 
tention to the just import of v.'ords, to 
the scope of argument, and to the con- 



nection of parts, was a labour from 
which they were utterly averse, and 
which they impiously despised. Instead 
of such faithful and honest endeavours 
to know the will of God, they stimu- 
lated a sportive fancy, a con-upt and 
often absurd ingenuity, to the invention 
of meanings the most remote from the 
design of the inspired writer, and the 
most foreign from the dictates of an 
unsophisticated understanding. No part 
of the Scriptures was safe from this 
profanation. The plainest narrative, 
the most solemn command, the most 
clear and interesting declaration of doc- 
trine, were made to bend beneath this 
iiTeverent violence. History tlie most 
ti-ue, the most ancient, and the most 
important in the world, was considered 
merely as the veliicle of mystic allegory. 
The rule of faith, and the standard of 
indissoluble duty, were made flexible 
and weak as the' spider's web, and the 
commandments ot God were rendered 
void. See D?: Smith'' s Sermon on the 
Jfwstolic Mirmti-y compared with the 
pjjetendons of sfiurious Religion and 
^se Philosophy. 

Q((^INITES, "a sect who sprang up 
about the year 130; so called, because 
thev esteemed Cain worthy of the 
greatest honours. They honoured those 
who cariT in Scripture' the most ■visible 
marks of reprobation ; as the inhabi- 
tants of Sodom, Esau, Korah, Dathan, 
and Abiram. They had in particular 
great veneration for Judas, under the 
pretence that the death of Christ had 
saAed mankind.

CAL 



CALIXTINS, a branch of the Hus- 
sites in Bohemia and Moravia, in the 
fifteenth century. The principal point 
in which they differed from the church 
of Rome was the use of tlie chalice 
(calix) or communicating in both kinds. 
Calixtins was also a name given to those 
among the Lutherans who followed the 
opinions of George Calixtus, a celebra- 
ted divine in the sevententh century, 
who endeavoured to unite the Roniioh, 
Lutheran, and Calvinistic churches, in 
the bonds of charity and mutual bene- 
volence. He maintained, 1. That the 
fundamental doctrines of Christianity, 
by which he meant those elementary 
principles whence all its Iniths flow, 
were preserved pure in all three com- 
munions, and were contained in that 
ancient form of doctrine that is vulgarly 
known by the name of the apostles' 
creed. — 2. 1'hat the tenets and opinions 
which had been constantly received by 
the ancient doctors, during the first fn e 
centuries, were to be considered as of 
equal truth and authority with the ex- 
press declarations and doctrines of 
Scripture. 

CALL, CALLING, generally de- 
notes God's invitation to man to parti- 
cipate the blessings of salvation : it is 
termed effectual, to distinguish it fi-om 
that external or common call of the 
liglit of nature, but especially of the 
Gospel, in which men are invited to 
come to God, but which has no saving 
effect upon the heart: thus it is said, 
" Many are called, but few chosen." 
Matt. xxii. 14. Effectual calling has 
been more particularly defined to be 
"the work of God's Spirit, whereb)^, 
convincing us of our sin and misery, en- 
lightening our minds with the know- 
ledge of Christ, and renewing our wills, 
he doth persuade and enable us to em- 
brace Jesus Christ, freely offered to us 
in the Gospel." This may farther be 
considered as a call from darkness to 
light, 1 Pet. ii. 9 ; from bondage to li- 
berty. Gal. ii. 13 ; from the fellowship 
of the world to the fellowship of Clxrist, 
1 Cor. i. 9 ; from misery to happiness, 
1 Cor. vii. 15 ; from sin to holiness, 
1 Thess. iv. 7 ; finally, from all created 
good to the enjovment of eternal feli- 
city, 1 Pet. V. 10. It is considered in 
the Scripture as an holy callinc^, 2 Tim. 
i. 9; an high calling,' V\\i\.. iii. 14; an 
heavenly calling, HeTj. iii. 1 ; and with- 
out refientance, as God will never cast 
ofi' any who are once drawn to him, 
Rom. xi. 29. 

It has been a matter of dispute whe- 
ther the Gospel call should be general, 
i. e. preached to all men indiscriminate- 



ly. Some suppose that, as the elect only 
will be saved, it is to be preached only 
to them ; and, thei'efore, cannot invite 
all to come to Christ. But to this it is 
answered, that an unknown decree can 
be no nile of action, Deut. xxix. 29. 
Prov. ii. 13 ; that, as we know not who 
are the elect, we cannot tell but he 
maj' succeed our endeavours by ena- 
bling those who are addressed to com- 
ply \i\Xh. the call, and believe; that it is 
the Christian minister's commission t» 
preach the Gospel to every creature, 
Mark xvi. 15 ; that the inspired writers 
never cs:jfined themselves to preach 
to saints only, but reasoned with and 
persuaded sinners, 2 Cor. v. 11: — and, 
lastly that a general address to men's 
consciences has been greatly successful 
in promoting their conversion. Acts ii. 
23, 41. But it has been asked, if none 
but the elect can believe, and no man 
has any ability in himself to comply with 
the call, and as the Almighty knows 
that none but those to whom he gives 
grace can be effectually called, of what 
use is it to insist on a general and ex- 
ternal call.-* To this it is answered, 
that, by the external call, gross enor- 
mous crimes are often avoided ; habits 
of vice have been partly conquered ; and 
much moral good at least has been pro- 
duced. It is also observed, that though 
a man cannot convert himself, yet. he 
has a power to do some things that are 
materially good, though not good in all 
those circumstances that accompany or 
flow from i-egeneration : such were 
Ahab's humility, 1 Kings xxi. 29; 
Nineveh's repentance, Jer. iii. 5 ; and 
Herod's hearing of John, Mark vi. 20. 
On the whole, the design of God in 
giving this common call in the Gospel 
is the salvation of his people, the re- 
straining of many from wicked practi- 
ces and the setting forth of the glorious 
work of redemption by Jesus Christ.

CALVINISTS, those who embrace 
the doctrine and sentiments of Calvin, 
the celebrated reformer of the Chris- 
tian church from Romish superstition 
and doctrinal errors. 

John Calvin Avas born at Nogen, in 
Picardy, in the year 1509. He first stu- 
died the civil law, and was afterwards 
made professor of divinity at Geneva, 
in the year 1536. His genius, learning, 
eloquence, and pietv, rendered him re- 
spectable even in the eves of his enemies. 

The name of Calvihists seems to have 
been given at first to those who embra- 
ced iiDt merelv the doctrine, but the

church government and discipline es- 
tablishecTat Geneva, and to distinguish 
them from the Lutherans. But since 
the meeting of the synod of Dort, the 
name has been chiefly apphed to those 
who embrace his leading views of the 
(iospel, to distuigiiish them from the 
Arminians. 

The leading principles taught by Cal- 
vin, were the same as those of Augus- 
tine. The main doctrines by which those 
who are called after his name are dis- 
tinguished from the Arminians, are re- 
duced to five articles : and vv;hich, from 
their being the principal points dis- 
cussed at the synod of Dort, have since 
been denominated the fnie points. These 
ai'c, predestination, particular redemp- 
tion, total depravity, eflFectual calling, 
and the certain perseverance of the 
saints. 

The following statement is taken, 
principally from the writings of Calvin 
and the decisions at Dort, compressed 
in as few words as possible. 

1. They maintain that God hath 
chosen a certain numlier of the fallen 
race of Adam in Christ, before the foun- 
dation of tlie world, unto eternal glory, 
according to his immutable purpose, 
and of his free gi-ace and love, without 
the least foresight of faitli, good works, 
or any conditions performed by tlie 
creature ; and that the rest of mankind 
he was pleased to pass by, and ordain 
to dishonour and wrath, for tlieir sins, to 
the praise of his vindictive justice. 

In proof of this they allege, among 
many other Scripture passages, the fal- 
lowing: "According as he hath chosen 
us in him before the foundation of the 
world, that we should be holy, and 
without blame before him in love. — For 
he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on 
■whom I will have mercy, and I will 
have compassion on vv^hom I will have 
compassion. So, then, it ;s not of him 
that willeth, nor of him that runneth, 
but of God, that showeth mercy. Thou 
wilt say, then, Why doth he yet find 
fault ; for wlio hath resisted his will ? 
Nay, but, O man ! who art thou that 
replicst against (iod •* Shall the th'ng 
formed say to him that formed it, Whv 
hast thou made me thus:* Hath not 
the potter pov/er over the clay, of the 
same lump to make one vessel unto 
honour and another unto dishonour ? — 
Hath God cast away his people whom 
he foreknew? Wot ye not what the 
Sci-ipture saith of Elias? Even so at 
this present time, also, there is a rem- 
nant according to the ekction of grace. 
And if by grace, then it is no 'more of 
works. What then? Israel hath not 



obtained that which he seeketh for, but 
the election hath obtained it, coid the 
rest arc blinded. — Whom he did pre- 
destinate, them he also called. — We 
give thanks to God always for yoti 
brethren beloved of the Lord, because 
God hath froirt the beginning chosen 
you to salvation, through sanctification 
of the Spirit and belief of the tiiith. — 
As many as were ordained to etenial 
life, believed." Eph. i. 4. Rom. ix. 
xi. 1—6. viii. 29, 30. 2 Thess. ii. 13. 
Acts xiii. 48. They think also that 
the greater part of these passages, be- 
ing found in the epistolary writings, 
after the pouring out of the Holy Spirit, 
who was p : omised to guide the apostles 
into all truth, is an argument in favour 
of the doctrine. 

They do not consider predestination, 
however, as affecting the agency or 
accountableness of creatures, or as be- 
ing to them any rule of conduct. On 
the contrary, they suppose them to act 
as freely, and to be as much the proper 
subjects of calls, warnings, exhortations, 
promises, and threatenings, as if no de- 
cree existed. The connexion in which 
the doctrine is introduced by the divines 
at Dort, is to account for one sinner's 
believing and being saved rather than 
another; and such, the Calvinists sav, 
is the connection which it occupies In 
the Scriptures. 

With respect to the conditional pre- 
destination admitted by the Arminians, 
the)' say that an election upon faith or 
good works foreseen, is not that of the 
Scriptures; for that election is there 
made the cause of faith and holiness, 
and cannot, for this reason, be the effect. 
of them. With regard to predestina- 
tion to death, they say, if the question 
i be. Wherefore did God decree to punish 
those who are punished ? the answer 
is. On account of their sins. But if it 
be. Wherefore did he decree to punish 
them rather than others ? there is no 
other reason to be assigned, but that so 
it seemed good in his sight. Eph. i. 3, 
4. John vi. 57. Rom. viii. 29, 30. 
Acts xiii. 48. 1 Pet. i. 1. Rom. ix. 15, 
16. xi. 5, 6. 

2. They maintain that though the 
death of Christ be a most perfect sa- 
crifice, and satisfaction for sins, of in- 
finite value, abundantly sufficient to ex- 
piate the sins of the whole world ; and 
though on this grouTid the Gospel is to 
be preached to all mankind indiscrimi- 
nately ; yet it was the will of God that 
Christ, by the blood of the cross, should 
eflficaciously redeem all those, and those 
only, wIt^ were from eternity elected to 
salvation, and given to him by the Father.

Calvin does not appear to have writ- 
ten on this subject as a controversy, 
but his comments on Scripture agree 
with the above statement. The follow- 
ing positions are contained in the reso- 
lutions of the synod of Dort, under this 
head of doctrine : — " The deatli of the 
Son of God is the only and most perfect 
sacrifice and satisfaction for sins, of in- 
finite value and price, abundantly suf- 
ficient to expiate the sins of the whole 
world. — The promise of the Gospel is, 
that whosoever believeth in Christ cru- 
cified shall not perish, but have ever- 
lasting life; which promise, together 
with the command to repent and be- 
lieve, ought promiscuously and indis- 
criminately to be published and pro- 
posed to all people and individuals, to 
whom God in his good pleasure sends 
the Gospel. — Whei-eas, many who are 
called by the Gospel do not repent nor 
believe in Christ, but perish in unbe- 
lief; this proceeds not from any defect 
or insufficiency in the sacrifice of Christ 
offered on the cross, but from their own 
fault. — As many as truly believe, and 
are saved by the death of Christ from 
their sins, and from destnictioii, ha\'e to 
ascribe it to the m.ere fa\our of God, 
which he owes to no one, given them in 
Christ from eternity. — For it was the 
most free counsel, and gracious nvill and 
intention of God the Father, that the 
quickening, and saving efficacy of the 
most precious death of his Son should 
exeit itself in all the elect, to give unto 
them only justifying faith, and by it to 
conduct tliem infallibly to salvation ; 
that is, it was the will of God that 
Christ, by the blood of the cross, 
whereby he confirmed the new cove- 
nant, should efficaciously redeem out of 
every people, tribe, nation, and lan- 
guage, all those, and those only, who 
were from eternity elected to salvation, 
and given to him by the Father." 

These ])Ositions they appear to have 
considered as not only a declaration of 
the truth, but an answer to the argu- 
ments of the Remonstrants. 

In proof of the doctrine, they allege 
among others the following Scripture 
passages : " Thou hast given him pow- 
er over all flesh, that he should give 
eternal life to as many as thou hast 
gh'en him. — The good shepherd giveth 
his life for the sheep. — I lay down mv 
life for the sheep. — He died not for 
that nation only, but that he might 
gather together in one the children 
of God that are scattered abroad. — He 
gave himself for us, that he might re- 
deem us from all iniijuity, and purify 
.mifi himself a peculiar ficoplc, zealous 



of good works. — He loved the churchy 
and gave himself for it, that he might 
sanctify and cleanse it and present it to 
himself, &amp;c. — And they sang a new 
song, saying. Thou ai-t worthy ; for 
thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us 
to God by thy blood, out of every kin- 
dred, and tongue, and people, aiid na- 
tion." John xvii. 2. x. 11, 15. xi. 52. 
Tit. ii. 14. Eph. v. 25— 2r. Rev. v. 9. 
3. They maintain that mankind are 
totallv depraved, in consequence of 
the fall of the first man, who, being 
their public head,' his sin involved the 
conniption of all his posterity, and 
which corruption extends o\-'er the 
whole soul, and renders it unable to 
turn to God, or to do any thing ti-uly 
good, and exposes it to his righteous 
displeasure, both in tliis world and that 
which is to come. 

The explanation of original sin, as 
given by Calvin, is as follows: "Origi- 
nal sin seems to be the inheritable de- 
scending perverseiicss and corruption 
of our nature, poured abroad into all 
the parts of the soul, which first maketh 
us deserving of God's wrath, and then 
also bringeth forth those works in us, 
called, in Scripture, the ivorks of the 
flesh. These two things are distinctly 
to be noted, that is, thai, being thus in 
all parts of our nature cornipted and 
per\erted, we are now, even for such 
corruption only, holden worthv of dam- 
nation, and stand convicted before God, 
to whom nothing is acceptable but 
righteousness, innocence, and purity. 

i And yet we are not bound in respect of 
another's fault; for where it is said that 
by the sin of Adam we are made sub- 
ject to the judgment of God, Rom. v. 
18. it is not so to be taken, as if Ave, 
innocent and undeserving, did bear the 
blame of his fault ; but as, in conse- 
quence of his offence, we are ultimatelv 
clothed with the curse, therefore it is 
said that he hath bound us. Never- 
theless from him not tlie punishment 
only came upon us, bnt also the infec- 
tion distilled from him abideth in us, 
to the which the punishment is justly 
due." 

The resolutions of the divines at Dort 
on this head, contain the following posi- 
tions. "Such as man was after the 
fall, such children did he beget — cor- 
ruption by the righteous judgment of 
God being derived from Adam to his 

' posterity — not by imitation, but by the 
propagation of a vicious nature. \y here- 
fore all men are conceived in sin, and 
are bom the children of wrath, unfit 
for every good connected with sal\-a- 
tion, jjrone to evil, dead b- sins, and the 



•I

servants of sin; and without the Holy 
Spirit regenerating them, they neither 
will nor can return to God, amend 
their depraved natures, nor dispose 
themselves for its amendment. 

In proof of this doctrine, the Calvin- 
ists tiUege, among other Scrii^ture pas- 
sages, the followmg: "By one man sin 
entered into the world, and death by 
sin ; and so death passed upon all men, 
for that all have sinned. — By one man's 
disobedience many Avere made sinners. 
— I was bom in sm, and shapen in ini- 
quity. — God saw that the wickedness of 
man was ^eat upon the earth, and 
that eveiy imagination of his heart was 
only evil continually. — God looked down 
from heaven upon the children of men, 
to see if there were any that did un- 
derstand, that did seek God. Every 
one of them is gone back ; they are al- 
together become filthy; there is none 
that doeth good, no not one. — And you 
hath he quickened who were dead in 
trespasses and sins. Wherein in time 
past ye walked according to the course 
of this world, among whom also ive all 
had our conversation in times past, in 
the lust of our flesfi, fulfilling the de- 
sires of the flesh and of the mind ; and 
were bij nature the children of wrath, 
even as others." Rom. v. 12 — 19. Ps. 
li. 5. Gen. vi. 5. Ps. liii. 2, 3. Rom. iii. 
Eph. ii. 1—3. 

4. They maintain that all whom God 
hath predestinated unto life, he is pleas- 
ed, in his appointed time, effectually to 
call by his word and S]))rit out of that 
state of sin and death in which they 
are by nature, to grace and salvation by 
Jesus Christ. 

They admit that the Holy Spirit, as 
calling men by the ministry of the Gos- 
pel, may be resisted : and that where 
this is the case, "the fault is not in the 
Gospel, nor in Christ offered by the 
Gospel, nor in God calling by the Gos- 
pel, and also conferring various gifts 
upon them ; but in the called them- 
selves. They contend, however, that 
"whei'e men come at the di\ine call, and 
are converted, it is not to be ascribed to 
themselves, as though by their own 
free will they made themselves to 
differ, but merely to him who delivers 
them from the power of darkness, and 
translates them into the kingdom of his 
dear Son, and whose regenerating in- 
fluence is certain and efficacious." 

In proof of this doctrine the Calvin- 
ists allege, among others, the following 
Scripture passages: "Whom he did 
predestinate, them he also called ; and 
whom he called, them he also glorified. 
— That Y^ may know what is the ex- 



ceeding greatness of his power to tis- 
ward who believe, according to the 
working of his mighty power, which he 
wrought in Christ when he raised hint 
from the dead. — Not of works, lest any 
man should boast. For we are his 
Tjorkmanship created in Christ Jesus 
unto good works. — God, that command- 
ed the light to shine out of darkness, 
hath shined into our hearts, &amp;c. — I wUl 
take away the stony heart out of their 
flesh, and will give them hearts of 
flesh." Rom. viii. 29. Eph. i. 19, 20. 
ii. 9, 10. 2 Cor. iv. 6. Ezek. xxxvi. 
26. 

5. Lastly : They maintain that those 
whom God has effectually called, and 
sanctified by his Spirit, shall never 
finally fall from a state of grace. They 
admit that true helieAers may fall par- 
tially, and would fall totally and finally 
but for the mercy and faithfulness of 
God, who keepeth the feet of his saints; 
also, that he who bestoweth the grace 
of perseverance, bestoweth it by means 
of reading and hearing the word, medi- 
tation, exhoitations, threateuings, and 
oromises; but that none of these things 
impl}' the possibility of a believer's fall- 
ing from a state of justification. 

In proof of this doctrine they allege 
the toUowing among other Scripture 
passages: — "I will put my fear in their 
hearts, and they shall not depart from 
me. — He that believeth, and is baptized, 
shall be saved. — The water that I shall 
give him shall be in him a well of water 
sfiringini^ up into everlasting- Ife. — 
This is the Father's will, that of all 
ivhich he hath given ?ne I should lose 
nothing. — This is life eterfial, to know 
thee, the only true God, and Jesus 
Christ whom thou hast sent. — Wnioso- 
ever is born of God doth not commit 
sin, for his seed remaineth in him ; and 
he cannot sin, because he is born of 
God. They went out from us, but 
they were not of us ; for if they had 
been of us, they would have continued 
with lis: but they went out, that they 
might be made manifest that they were 
not all of us. — Now unto him that is 
able to keep you from falling, and to 
present you faultless before the pre- 
sence of his glory with exceeding joy, 
to the only wise Gotl our Saviour, be 
glory and majesty, dominion and power, 
both ".ow and ever, Amen." Jer. xxxii. 
40. Mark xvi. 16. John iv. 14. vi. 40. 
■K\\\. 3. 1 John iii. 9. ii. 19. Jude 24, 
25. 

Such were the doctrines of the old 
Calvinists, and such in substance are 
those of the present times. In this, 
however, as in every other denomina- 



CAL 



75 



CAM 



tion, there are considerable shades of 
difference. 

Some think Calvin, though right in 
the main, yet carried things too far; 
these are commonly known bv the 
name of Moderate Calvinists. Others 
think he did not go far enough ; and 
these are known by the name of High 
Calvinists. 

It is proper to add, that the Calvin- 
istic system includes in it the dncti'ine 
of three co-ordinate persons in the 
Godhead, in one nature, and of two na- 
tures in Jesus Christ, forming one per- 
son. Justification by faith alone, or 
justification ijy the imputed righteous- 
ness of Christ, fonns also an essential 
part of this system. They suppose 
that on the one hand our sins are im- 
puted to Christ, and on the other, that 
we are justified by the imputation of 
Christ's righteousness to us ; that is, 
Christ, the innocent, was treated by 
God as if he were guilt}', that we, the 
g-uilty, might, out of regard to what he 
did and suftered, be treated as if we 
wei*e innocent and righteous. 

Calvinism originally subsisted in its 

?;reatest purity in the city of Geneva; 
rom which place it was fii-st propa- 
gated into Germany, France, the Uni- 
ted Provinces, and Britain. In France 
it was abolished by the revocation of 
the edict of Nantz. It has been the 
prevailing religion in the United Pro- 
vinces ever since 1571. The theologi- 
cal system of Calvin was adopted and 
made the public rule of faith in Eng- 
land vuider the reign of Edward VI. 
The church of Scotland also was mo- 
delled by John Knox, agreeably to the 
doctrine, rites, and form of ecclesias- 
tical government established at Ge- 
neva. In England, Calvinism had been 
on the decline from the time of queen 
Elizabeth until about sixty years ago, 
when it was again revived, and , has 
been On the increase ever since. The 
major part of the clergy, indeed, are 
not Calvinists, though the articles of 
the church of England are Calvinis- 
tical. It deserves to be remarked, 
however, that Calvinism is preached 
in a considerable number of the church- 
es in London; in nearly all the dis- 
senting meetings of the Presbyterians, 
Baptists, and Independents; arid in all 
tl\e chapel-s of Whitefield, Lady Hun- 
tingdon, and others of that class. In 
Scotland it continues also to exist as 
the established religion ; and within a 
few years it has much revived in that 
country, through the influence of Mr. 
Haldane and others; but as those 
among whom this revival has taken 



place are not of the established church, 
they have been treated. with indiffer- 
ence by the clergy, and called Halda- 
nists. 

Calvm considered every church as a 
separate and independent body, invest- 
ed with the power of legislation for 
itself. He proposed that it should be 
governed by presbyteries and synods 
composed of clergy and laity, without 
bishops, or any clerical subordination ; 
and maintained that the province of the 
civil magistrate extended only to its 
protection and outward accommoda- 
tion. He acknowledged a real, though 
spiritual presence of Christ in the eu- 
cnarist; and he confined the privilege 
of communion to pious and regenerate 
believers. These sentiments, however, 
are not imbibed by all who are called 
Calvinists. 

See Calvin's Institutes; Life of 
Calvin; Bririe's Tracts; Jonathan Ea- 
nvards' Works ; Gill's Cause of God 
and Truth ; Tofilady's Historic Proof

chism ; Fuller's Calvinistic and Soci- 
7iian Systems compared. 

CAMALDOLITES, an order found- 
ed by St. Romuald, an Italian fanatic, 
in the eleventh century. The manner 
of life he enjoined his disciples to ob- 
serve was this: — They dwelt in sepa- 
rate cells, and met together only at the 
time of prayer. Some of them, during 
the two Lents in the year, observed an 
inviolable silence, and others for the 
space of a hundred days. On Sundays 
and Thursdays they fed on herbs, and 
the rest of the week only on bread and 
water. 

CAMBRIDGE MANUSCRIPT, a 
copy of the Gospels and Acts of the 
Apostles, in Greek and Latin. Beza 
found it in the monastery of Irenasus, 
at Lyons, in 1562, and gave it to the 
university of Cambridge in 1582. It is 
a quarto, and written on vellum : sixty- 
six leaves of it are mucli torn and mu- 
tilated ; and ten of these are supplied 
by a later transcriber. From this and 
the Clermont copy of St. Paul's epis- 
tles, Beza published his larger annota- 
tions in 1582. See Dr. Kipling's edi- 
tion of it. 

CAMERONIANS, a sect in Scot- 
land, who separated from the Presby- 
I terians in 1666, and continued long to 
hold their religious assemblies in the 
fields. They took their name from 
Richard Cameron, a famous field- 
preacher, who, refusing to accept the 
mdulgence to tender consciences, 
granted by king Charles II. thinking 
such an acceptance an acknowledg-

iTient of the king's supremacy, made a

headed a i-ebelhon, in which he was 
killed. The Cameronians adhere ri- 
gidly to the form of government esta- 
blished in 1648. There are not, it is 
said, above foui'teen or fifteen congre- 
gations among them, and these not 
large. 

CAMERONIANS, or Cameron- 
ITES, the denomination of a party of 
Calvinists in France, who assorted that 
the will of man is only determined by 
the practical judgment of the mind ; 
that the cause of men's doing good or 
evil proceeds from the knowledge 
•vvhicli God infuses into them ; and that 
God docs not move the will physically, 
but only morally, in virtue of its de- 
pendence on the judgment. They had 
this name from John Cameron, who 
was born at Glasgow m 1580, and who 
was professor there, and afterwards at 
Bourdeaux, Sedan, and Saumur. The 
synod of Dort was severe upon them ; 
yet it seems the only diffei'ence was 
this: — The s\nod had defined that God 
not omy illuminates the understanding, 
but gives motion to the will, by making 
an internal change therein. Cameron 
only admitted the illumination whereby 
the mind is morally moved ; and cx- 

flained the senthnent of the Synod of 
)oi-t so as to make tlie two opinions 
consistent. 

CANDOUR is a disposition to form 
a fair and impartial judgment on the 
opinions and actions of others ; or a 
temper of mind unsoured by envy, un- 
niffled b)' malice, and unseduced by 
prejudice; sweet Vvithout weakness, 
and impartial wi^liout rigour. Can- 
dour is a word which, in the present 
day, is found exceedingly convenient. 
To the infidel it is a shelter for his 
scepticism, to the ignorant fiir his ig- 
norance, to the lukewarm for his indif- 
ference, and to the irreligious for their 
error. " True candour is different 
from that guarded, inoffensive lan- 
guage, and that studied openness of 
behaviour, which we so frequently 
naeet with among men of the world. 
It consists not in fairness of speech 
only, but in fairness of heart. It is not 
blind attacliment, external courtesy, or 
a time-serving principle. Exempt, on 
the one hand, from the dark jealousy of 
a suspicious mind, it is no less removed, 
on the other, from that easy credulity 
which is imposed on by every specious 
pretence. Its manners are unaffect- 
ed, and its professions sincere. 'It 
conceals faults, but it does not invent 
virtues.' In fine, it is the happy me- 



dium between undistinguishing credu- 
lity and universal suspicion." See 
Liberality. 

CANON, a word used to denote the 
authorised catalogue of the sacred wri- 
tings. "The Greek Avord icuvm," says 
Dr. Owen, " which gives rise to the 
term canonical, seems to be derived 
from the Hebrew n:p kaneh, which in 
general signifies any reed whatever, 
1 Kings xiv. 15. Isa. xliii. 3. and par- 
ticularly a reed made into an instni- 
ment, wherewith they measured their 
buildings, containing six cubits in length, 
Ezek. xl. 7. xliii. 16. and hence indefi- 
nitely it is taken for a rule or measure. 
Besides, it signifies the beam and tongue 
of a balance. Isa. xlvi. 6. 'They 
v/eighed silver on the cane j' that is, 
saith the Targiiw, 'in the balance.' 
This also is the primary and proper 
signification of the Cireek word. Hence 
its metaphorical use, which is most 
common, wherein it signifies a moral 
rule. Aristotle calls the law Kavif* 
T«c TToxnui.;, the rule of the administra- 
tion ; and hence it is that the Avritten 
word of God being in itself absolutely 
rii^ht, and appointed to be the rule of 
faith and obedience, is eminently called 
' canonical.' " 

The ancient canon of the books of 
the Old Testament, ordinarily attribu- 
ted to Ezra, v/as divided into' the law, 
the prophets, and the hagiographia, to 
which our Saviour refers, Luke xxiv. 
45. The same division is also men- 
tioned by Josephus. This is the canon 
allowed to have been followed by the 
primitive church till the council of 
Carthage ; and, according to Jerome, 
this consisted of no more than twenty- 
two books, answering to the number of 
the Hebrew alphabet, though at pre- 
sent they are classed into twenty-four 
divisions. That council enlarged the 
canon very considerably, taking into it 
the apocryphal books; which the coun- 
cil of Trent farther enforced, enjoining 
them to be received as books of holy 
Scripture, upon pain of anathema. 
The Romanists, m defence of this 
canon, say, that it is the same with that 
of the council of Hippo, held in 393 ; 
and with that of the third council of 
Carthage in 397, at which were pre- 
sent forty-six bishops, and among tlift 
rest St. Augustine. Their canon of 
the New Testament, however, perfect- 
ly agrees with ours. It consists of 
books that are well known, some of 
which have been universally acknow- 
ledged ; such are the four Gospels, the 
Acts of the Apostles, thirteen epistles 
of St. Paul, first of St. Peter, and first

CAN 



of St. John ; and others, coRceniing 
which doubts were entertained, but 
which were afterwards I'eceived as 
genuine ; such are the Epistle to the 
Hebrews, that of James, the second of 
Peter, the second and third of John, 
that of Jude, and the Revelation. 
These books were written at different 
times; and they are authenticated, not 
by the decrees of councils, or infallible 
authority, but by such evidence as is 
thought sufficient in the case of any 
other ancient writings. They were ex- 
tensively diffused, and read in every 
Christian society ; they were valuecl 
and preserved with care by the first 
Christians ; they were cited by Chris- 
tian writers of the second, third, and 
fourth centuries, as Ii'enxus, Clement 
the Alexandrian, Tertullian, Origen, 
Eusebius, £cc. ; and their genuineness 
is proved by tiie testimony of those who 
were contemporary Avith the apostles 
themselves. The four Gospels, and 
most of the other books of the New 
Testament, were collected either bv 
one of the apostles, or some of their 
disciples and successors, before the end 
of the first century. The catalogue of 
canonical books furnished by the more 
ancient Christian writers, as Origen, 
about A. D. 210, Eusebius and Athana- 
sius in 315, Epiphanius in 370, Jerome 
in 382, Austin in 394, and many others, 
agrees Avith that which is now received 
among Christians.

CANON, a person who possesses a 
prebend or revenue allotted for the 
performance of divine service in a ca- 
thedral or collegiate church. Canons 
are of no great antiquity. Paschier 
observes, that the name was not known 
before Charlemagne ; at least, the first 
we hear of are in Gregory de Tours, 
who mentions a college of canons in- 
stituted by Baldwin XVI, archbishop 
of that city, in the time of Clotharius I. 
The common opinion attributes the in- 
stitution of this order to Chrodcgangus, 
bishop of Mentz, about the middle of 
the eightli century. 

CANON, in ah ecclesiastical sense, 
is a rule either of doctrine or disci- 
pline, enacted especially by a council, 
and confirmed by the authority of the 
sovereign. Canons are properly deci- 
sions of matters of religion, or regula- 
tions of the policy and discipline of a I 



church made by councils, either gene^ 
ral, national, or provincial ; such are 
the canons of the council of Nice, of 
Trent, 8cc. 

CANONICAL HOURS are certain 
stated times of the day consigned more 
especially by the Romish church to 
the offices of prayer and devotion ; 
such are matins, lauds, &amp;c. In Eng- 
land the canonical hours are from eight 
to twelve in the forenoon ; before or 
after which marriage cannot be legally 
performed in anv church. 

CANONICAL LETTERS, in the 
ancient church, were testimonials of 
the orthodox faith which the bishops 
and clergy sent each other to keep up 
the catholic communion, and distin- 
guish orthodox Christians from here- 
tics. 

CANONICAL LIFE, the rule of 
li-\'ing prescribed by the ancient clergy 
who lived in community. The canoni- 
cal life was a kind of medium between 
the monastic and clerical lives. 

CANONICAL OBEDIENCE, is 
that submission which, by the ecclesias- 
tical laws, the inferior clergy are to pay 
to their bishops, and the religious to 
their superiors. 

CANONIZATION, a ceremony in 
the Romish church, t)v which j^ersons 
deceased are ranked In the catalogue 
of the saints. It succeeds beatification. 
Before a beatified person is canonized, 
the qualifications of the candidate are 
strictly examined into, in some consis- 
tories held for that puqjose ; after 
which one of the consistorial advocates, 
in the presence of the pope and cardi- 
nals, makes the paneg^Tic of the per- 
son who is to be proclaimed a saint, 
and gives a particular detail of his life 
and miracles; which being done, the 
holy father decrees his canonization, 
and appoints the day. 

On the day of canonization, the pope 
officiates in white, and their eminences 
are dressed in the same colour. St. 
Peter's church is hung with rich tapes- 
try, upon which the anns of the pojie. 
and of the prince or state requiring the 
canonization, are embroidered in gold 
and silver. A great number of lights 
blaze all round the church, which is 
crowded with pious souls, who wait 
with devout impatience till the new 
saint has made his public entry, as it 
were, into paradise, that they riiav of- 
fer up their petitions to liini without 
danger of being rejected. 

The following maxim with regard to 
canonization is now oliserved, though 
it has not been followed above a centu- 
ly, viz. not to ente;- into the inquiries

f)rioi' to canonization till fifty years, at 
east, aftei' the death of the person to 
be canonized. By the ceremony of 
canonization it appears that this rite of 
the modern Romans has something in 
it very lilce the apotheosis or deification 
of the ancient Romans, and in all pro- 
bability takes it rise from it ; at least, 
several ceremonies of the same nature 
are cons]")icnous in both. 

CAPUCHINS, religious, of the or- 
der of St. Francis. They are clothed 
with brown or grey; always bare- 
footed; never go m a coach, nor ever 
shave their beards. 

C APUTIATI, a denomination which 
appeared in the twelfth century, so call- 
ed from a smgular kind of cap which 
distinguished their party. They wore 
upon their caps a leaden image of the 
virgin Mary, and declared piJjlicly 
that their purpose was to level all dis- 
tinctions, to alnogate magistracy, and 
to remove all subordination among 
mankind, and to restore that primitive 
liberty, that natural eqiiality, which 
were the inestimable privilege of the 
first mortals. 

CARAITES, a Jewish sect, which 
adheres closely to the text and letter 
of the Scriptures, rejecting the fabbini- 
cal interpretations and the cabba,la. 
The Talmud appearing in the begin- 
nhig of the sixth century, those of the 
best sensje among the Jews were dis- 
gusted at the ridiculous fables with 
which it abounded. But a!)out the 
year 750, Anan, a Babylonish Jew, de- 
clared openly for the written word of 
God alone, exclusive of all tradition ; 
and this declaration produced a schism. 
Those who maintained the Talmud 
being almost all rabbins, were called 
rabbinists ; and the others, who reject- 
ed traditions, were called Caraites, or 
Scripturists, fi'om the word ca7'a, which 
in the Babylonish language signifies 
Scripture. 

CARDINAL, one of the chief go- 
vernors of the Romish church, by whom 
the pope is elected out of their own 
numbei", which contains six bishops, 
fifty priests, and fourteen deacons: 
these constitute the sacred college, and 
are chosen by the pope. See Pope. 

CARDINAL VIRTUES: justice, 
prudence, temperance, and fortitude, 
are called the four cardinal virtues, as 
being the basis of all the rest. See Jus- 
tice, &amp;c. 

CARE, concern, or anxiety of mind 
arising from the unceitai-aty of some- 
thing future, or the oppression of the 
present calamity. Caution, attention 
to a particular subject; regard and 



support, when followed with the par* 
tide of. Prudence signifies wisdom 
applied to practice ; discretion is the 
effect of prudence, and means a know- 
ledge to govern or direct one's self: 
by care we understand heed in order to 
preservation ; caution implies a greater 
degree of wariness. 

Care ts laivful when it consists in a 
serious thought and earnest endeavour 
to please God; to embrace his Son, 
obey his commands, submit to his pro- 
vidence, to promote our neighbours' 
temporal or spiritual advantage, and to 
gain the goods of this life so far as ne- 
cessary for our health, family, comfort, 
and usefulness. It is sinful, when it 
leads us to immoderate concern about 
earthly things, to be discontented with 
our lot, or to make use of unlawful 
means to Obtain worldly good ; or when 
exercised in a way of vain curiosity, 
John xxi. 22. 

CARE OF THE SOUL, a term 
used for religion, or that serious atten- 
tion we ought to pay to our best inte- 
rests. It imports repentance, faith, de- 
votion, and obedience. " It is consider- 
ed as the one thing needful : as 1. It is 
matter of unixersal concern. 2. Of the 
higliest importance. 3. Includes every 
thing worthy of our regard." 4. Essen- 
tial to our peace here. 5. Without it 
we cannot obtain e\erlasting life, Luke 
X. 42. Jer. vi. 16. Heb. xii. 14. 

CARE OF (iOD, is his attention to 
and concern for the promotion of the 
welfare of his creatures, 1 Pet. v. 7. 
1. That God does manifest this care is 
evident from the blessings we enjoy, 
the oi'dinances he has instituted, the 
promises he has given, and the pinvi- 
sion he has made, Ps. Ixxxiv. 11. Matt. 
vii. 12. — 2. This care is entirely free, 
and unmerited on our part. Gen. xxxii. 
10. Dent. vii. 6. Rom. iii. 23. — 3. It is 
every way extensive, reaching to all 
his creatures and to all cases. Ps. 
cxlv. — 4. It is superior to all hiunan 
care and attention. He cares for us 
when others cannot ; when others will 
not care for us ; or when we cannot or 
will not care for ourselves. Ps. cxli'. 
4, 5. Jer. xlix. 11. Ps. xli. 3.-5. It is 
not only great, but perpetual. Through 
all the scenes of life, \n death, and for 
ever. Heb. xiii. 5. John xvii. 9. See 
Providenck. 

CARMATHITES; the followers of 
a noted impostor in the ninth century, 
who endeavoured to overthrow all the 
foundations of Mussulmanism. Car- 
math their prophet was a person of 
great austenty of life ; and said that 
God had commanded him to pray not

^fix'e times, with the Mussulmans, but 
\fifty times a day. To comply with this, 
they often neglected their business ; 
they ate many things forbidden by the 
law of Mahomet, and believed that an- 
gels were their guides in all their ac- 
tions, and that the demons or ghosts 
are their enemies. 

CARMELITES, one of the four 
tribes of Mendicants, or begging friars ; 
so named from Mount Carmel, former- 
ly inhabited by Elias, Elisha, and the 
children of the prophets; from whom 
this order pretends to descend in unin- 
terrupted succession. Their habit was 
at first white ; but pope Honorius IV. 
commanded them to change it for that 
of the Minims. They wear no linen 
shirts, but, instead of them, linsey-wol- 
sev- 

CARPOCRATIANS, a branch of 
the ancient Gnostics, so called from 
Caipocrates, who in the second cen- 
tury revived and improved upon the 
en-'ors of Simon Magus, Menender, Sa- 
tumius, and other Gnostics. See Gnos- 
tics. 

CARTHUSIANS, a religious order 
founded A. D. 1080, by one Bi-udo; so 
called from the desert Chartreux, the 
l&gt;lace of their institution. Their rule 
is extremely severe. They must not 
go out of their cells, except to church, 
without leav^ of their superior; nor 
speak to any person Avithout leave. 
'Fhey must not keep any meat or 
drink till next day : their beds are of 
straw covered with a felt ; their cloth- 
ing, two hair cloths, two cowls, two 
fair of hose, and a cloak ; all coarse, 
n the refectory they must keep their 
eyes on the dish, their hands on the 
table, their attention to the reader, and 
their hearts fixed on God. Women 
must not come into their churches. 

CASUALTY, an event that is not 
foreseen or intended. See Contin- 
gency. 

CASUIST, one that studies and set- 
tles cases of conscience. It is said that 
Escobar has made a collection of the 
opinions of all the casuists before him. 
M. Le Feore, preceptor of Louis XIII. 
called the books of the casuists the art 
of quibbling with God ; which does not 
seem far from truth, by reason of the 
multitude of distinctions and subtleties 
they abound with. Mayer has publish- 
ed a bibliotheca of casuists, containing 
an account of all the writers on cases of 
conscience, ranged under three heads ; 
the first comprehending the Lutheran, 
the second the Calvinist, and the third 
the Romish casuists. 

CASUISTRY, the doctrine and sci- 



CAT 

ence of conscience and its cases, with 
the rules and principles of resolving 
the same; drawn partly from natural 
reason or equity, and partly from the 
authority of Scri])ture, the canon law, 
councils, fathers, &amp;c. To casuistry be- 
longs the decision of all difnculties ari- 
sing aliout what a man may lawfully do 
or not do ; what is sin or not sin ; what 
things a man is obliged to do in order to 
discharge his duty, and what he may 
let alone without breach of it. 

Some suppose that all books of casu- 
istry ai-e as useless as the}' are tiresome. 
One who is really anxious to do his duty 
must be veiy weali, it it said, if he can 
imagine that he has much occasion for 
them ; and with regard to one who is 
negligent of it, the st\le of those wri- 
tings is not such as is likely to awaken 
him to more attention. The frivolous 
accuracy which casuists attempt to in- 
troduce into subjects which do not ad- 
mit of it, almost necessarily betray them 
into dangerous errors; and at the same 
time render their works diy and dis- 
agreealjle, aljounding in abstruse and 
metaphysical distinctions, but incapable 
of exciting in the heart any of those 
emotions which it is the principal use 
of books of moi'ality to produce. 

On the other hand, I think it may be 
observed, that, though these remarks 
may apply to same, they cannot apply 
to all books of casuistry. It must be 
acknowledged that nice distinctions, 
metaphysical reasonings, and abstnise 
terms, cannot be of much service to the 
generality, because there are so few 
who can enter into them ; yet, when we 
consider how much light is thrown 
upon a subject by the force, of good 
reasoning, by viewing a case in all its 
bearings, by properly considering all 
the objections that may be made to it, 
and by examining it in every point of 
view; if we consider also how little 
some men are accustomed to think, and 
yet at the same time possess that ten- 
derness of conscience which makes 
them fearful of doing wrong ; we must 
conclude that such works as these, 
when properly executed, may certainly 
be of considerable advantage. The 
reader may consult Ames's Power and 
Cases of Conscience ; Bishop. Taylor^ s 
Ductor Dubitantium ; Dr. Saunder- 
son's De Obligatione Conscientipe; Pike 
and Hayit'ard''s Cases; and Saurin's 
Christian Casuistry, in 4th vol. of his 
Sermons, p. 265, English edition. 

CATECHISING, instructing by ask- 
ing questions and correcting the an- 
swers. Catechising is an excellent mean 
■ of informing the rnind, engaging the at- 



CAT 

tention, and affecting the heart, and is 
an important duty incumbent on all who 
have children under their care. Chil- 
dren should not be suffered to grow up 
without instruction, under the pretence 
that the choice of religion ought to be 
perfectly free, and not biassed by the 
influence and authority of parents, or 
the power of education. As they have 
capacities, and are more capable of 
knowledge by instruction than by the 
exercise of their own reasoning powers, 
they should certainly be taught. This 
agrees both with thevoice of nature and 
the dictates of revelation, Deut. vi. 7.' 
^'rov. xxii. 6. Eph. vi. 4. The proprie- 
ty of this being granted, it may next be 
-observed, that, in order to facilitate their 
knowledge, short summaries of religion 
extracted from the Bible, in the way of 

auestion and answer, may be of consi- 
erable use. 1. Herebv, says Dr. Watts, 
the principles of Christianity are redu- 
ced mto short sentences, and easier to 
be understood by children. — 2. Hereby 
these principles are not only tlirown in- 
to a just and easy method, but every 
part is naturally introduced by a proper 
question ; and the rehearsal of the an- 
swer is made far easier to a child than 
it would be if the child were required to 
repeat the whole scheme of religion. — 
3. This way of teaching hath something 
familiar and delightful in it because it 
looks more like conversation and dia- 
logue. — 4. The very curiosity of the 
young mind is awakened by the question 
to know what the answer will be ; and 
the child will take pleasure in learning 
the answer by heait, to improve its own 
knowledge. See next article. 

CATECHISM, a form of instniction 
by means of questions and answers. 
There have been various catechisms 
published by different authors, but ma- 
ny of them "have been but ill suited to 
convey instruction to juvenile minds. 
Catechisms for children should be so 
framed as not to puzzle and confound, 
but to let the beams of divine light into 
their minds by degrees. They should 
be accommodated as far as possible to 
the weakness of their understandings ; 
for mere learning sentences by rote, 
without comprehending the meaning, 
will be but of little use. In this way they 
will know nothing but words: it will 
prove a laborious task, and not a plea- 
sure ; confirm them in a bad habit of 
dealing in sounds instead of ideas ; and 
after all, perhaps create in them an 
aversion to religion itself. Dr. Watts 
advises that different catechisms should 
be composed for different ages and ca- 
pacities j the questions and answers 



80 



CAT 



should be shoi't, plain, and easy ; scho- 
lastic terms, and logical distinctions, 
should be avoided ; tlie most practical 
points of religion should be mserted; 
and one or more well chosen texts of 
I Scripture should be added to support 
I almost every answer, and to prove the 
several parts of it. The doctor has ad- 
[ mirably exemplified his own rules in 
j the catechism he has composed for 
j children at three or four years old ; that 
1 for children at seven or eight ; his as- 
sembly's catechism, proper for youth 
at twelve or fourteen ; his preservative 
from the sins and follies of childhood ; 
his catechism of Scripture names, and 
his historical catechism. These arc su- 
perior to any I know, and which I can- 
not but ardently recommend to parents, 
and all those who have the care and in- 
stniction of children. 

CATECHIST, one whose charge is 
to instruct by questions, or to question 
the uninstructed concerning religion. 

The catechists of the ancient churches 
were usually ministers, and distinct from 
the bishops and presbyters; and had 
their catechumena, or auditoi'ies, apart. 
But they did not constitute any distinct 
order of^the clergy, being chosen out of 
any order. The bishop himself some- 
times performed the office ; at other 
times, presbyters, readers, or deacons. 
It was his business to expose the folly 
of the pagan superstition, to remove 
prejudices, and answer objections ; to 
discourse on behalf of the Christian 
doctrines ; and to give instniction to 
those who had not sufficient knowledge 
to qualifv them for baptism. 

CATECHUMENS, the lowest order 
of Christians in the primitive church. 
They had some title to the common 
name of Christians, being a degree above 
pagans and heretics, though not consum- 
mated by baptism. They were admitted 
to the state of catechumens by the im- 
position of hands, and the sign of the 
cross. The children of believing pa- 
rents were admitted catechumens as 
soon as ever they were capable of in- 
stniction ; but at what age tliose of hea- 
then parents might be admitted is not 
so clear. As to the time of their con- 
tinuance in this state, there were no ge- 
neral rules fixed about it ; but the prac- 
tice varied according to the difference 
of times and places, and the readiness 
and proficiency of the catechumens 
themselves. There were four orders 
or degrees of catechumens. The first 
were those instructed privately without 
the church, and kept at a distance, for 
some time, from the privilege of enter- 
ing the church, to make them the more 



CAT 



CEL 



eager and desirous of it. The next de- 
gree were the audietites, so called from 
their being admitted to hear sermons 
and the Scriptures read in the church, 
but were not allowed to partake of the 
prayers. The third so;! of catechumens 
were the genu Jiectciites, so called be- 
cause they received imposition of hands 
kneeling. The fourth order was the 
competentes et electi ; denoting the im- 
mediate candidates for baptism, or such 
as were appointed to be baptized the 
next approaching festival; before which, 
strict examination was made into their 
proficiency, under the several stages of 
catechetical exercises. 

After examination, they were exer- 
cised for twenty da}s together, and were 
obliged to fasting and confession. Some 
days before baptism they went veiled ; 
and it was customary to touch their ears, 
saying, Kjihatha, i. e. Be opened ; as 
also to anoint their eye§ with clay : both 
ceremonies bemg in imitation of our Sa- 
vour's practice, and intended to signify 
to the catechumens their condition both 
before and after their admission into the 
Christian church. 

CATHARISTS, a sect that spread 
much in the Latin church in the twelfth 
century. Their religion resembled the 
doctrine of the Manichxans and Gnos- 
tics [see those articles.] They suppo- 
sed that matta- was the source of evil ; 
that Christ was not clothed with a real 
body; that baptism and the Lord's sup- 
per were useless institutions; with a 
variety of other strange notions. 

CATHEDRAL, tlie chief church of 
a diocese ; a church wherein is a bi- 
shop's see. The word comes from xjt6fefg* 
" chair :" the name seems to have taken 
its rise from the manner of sitting in the 
ancient churches or assemblies of pri- 
vate Christians. In these the council, 
i. e. the elders and priests, were called 
Presbyterium ; at their head was the 
bishop, who held the place of chairman, 
Cathedralis or Catlicdraticus ; and the 
presbyters, who sat on either side, also 
called by the ancient fathers ^sscssores 
Jifmcofiorum. The episcopal authority 
did not reside in the bishoj:) alone, but 
in all the presbyters, whereof the bishop 
was president. A cathedral, therefore, 
. originally was different from what it is 
now ; the Cliristians, till the time of 
Constantine, having no liberty to build 
any temple. By their churches they 
only meant assemblies; and by cathe- 
drals, nothing more than consistories. 

CATHOLIC, denotes anv thing that 
is universal or general. The rise of 
heresies induced the ]n'imitive Christian 
church to assume to itself the apjjcUa- 



tion of catholic, being a characteristic to 
distinguish itself from all sects, who, 
though they had party names, some- 
times sheltered themselves under the 
name of Christians. I'hc Romish church 
now distinguished itself by catholic in 
opposition to all who ha\ e separated 
from her communion, and Mhom she 
considers as heretics and schismatics, 
and herself only as the true and Chris- 
tian church. In the strict sense of the 
word, there is no catholic church in 
being ; that is, no taiiversdl Christian 
communion. 

CELESTINS, a religious order in 
the thirteenth century ; so called from 
their founder, Peter de Meuron, after- 
wards raised to tlie pontificate undei- 
the name of Celcstine V. The Celes- 
tins rose two hours after midnight to say 
matins ; ate no ficsli, except when sick ; 
and often fasted, 'ilieir habit consisted 
of a white gown, a capuche, a black 
scaijularv, and shirts of serge. 

CELIBACY, the state of unman-ied 
persons. Celibate, or celibacy, is a word 
chiefly used in speaking of the single 
life of the popish clergy, or the obliga- 
tion they are under to abstain from mar- 
riage. The church of Rome imposes au 
universal celibacy on all her clergy, 
from the pope to the lowest deacon and 
subdeacon. The advocates for tliis usage 
pretend that a vow of perpetual celiba- 
cy was required ia the ancient church 
as a condition of ordination, even fronL 
the earliest apostolic ages. But the con- 
trary is e\ident from numerous exam- 
ples of bishops and archbishops who 
lived in a state of matrimony, without 
any prejudice to their ordination or their 
function. Neither our Lord nor his apos- 
tles laid the least restraint upon the con- 
nubial union: on the contrary, the Scri])- 
tures speak of it as honourable in all, 
without the least restriction as to per- 
sons. Heb. ziii. 4. Matt. xix. 10, 12. 1 
Cor. vii. 2, 9. St. Paul even assigns for- 
bidding to many as characteristic of the 
apostacy of the' latter times, 1 Tim. iv. 
3. The fathers, without making any 
distinction between clergy and laity, 
asserted the lawfulness of the mar- 
riage of all Christians. IVIarriage was&gt; 
not forbidden to bishops in the Eastern 
church till the close ot the seventh cen- 
tury. Celibacy was not imposed on the 
Western clergy in general till tlie end 
of the ele\enth century, though at- 
tempts had been made long before. Su- 
perstitious zeal for a sanctimonious ap- 
pearance in the clergy seems to have 
promoted it at first ; lind crafty policy, 
armed with power, no doubt rivetted 
this clog on the sacerdotal order in later 



CER 



S'2 



periods of the church. Pope Gregory 
VII. appears in this business to have had 
a view to separate the clergy as much 
as possible trom all other interests, and 
to bring them into a total dependence 
upon his authority ; to the end that all 
temporal power might in a high degree 
be subjugated to the papal jurisdiction. 
Forbidding to marry, therefore, has 
evidently the mark of the beast upon 
it. See Marriage. 

CEMETERY, a place set apart for 
the burial of the dead. Anciently, none 
were buried in chui'ches or church- 
yards : it was even unlawful to inter in 
cities, and the cemeteries were without 
the walls. Among the primitive Chris- 
tians these were held in great venera- 
tion. It even appears from Eusebius 
and Tertullian, that in the early ages 
they assembled for divine worship in 
the cemeteries. Valerian seems to have 
confiscated the cemeteries and other 
places of divine worship ; but they were 
restored again i)y Gallienus. As the 
martyrs were buried in these places, 
the Christians chose them for building 
churches on, Avhen Constantine esta- 
blished their religion ; and hence some 
derive the rule which still obtains in the 
church of Rome, never to consecrate an 
altar without putting under it the relics 
of some saint. 

CENSURE, the act of judging and 
blaming others for their faults Faith- 
Julness in reproving another differs from 
censormusness : the former arises from 
love to truth, and respect for the per- 
son; the latter is a disposition that loves 
to find fault. However just censure may 
be where there is blame, yet a censo- 
rious spirit or rash judgmg must be 
avoided. It is usurjjing the authority 
and judgment of God. It is unjust, un- 
charitable, mischievous, productive of 
unhappiness to ourselves, and often the 
cause of disorder and confusion in so- 
cietv. See Rash Judging. 

CERDONIANS, a sect, in the first 
century, who espoused most of the opi- 
nions of Simon Magus and the iVIani- 
chxans. They asserted two principles, 
good and bad. The first they called 
the Father of Jesus Christ ; the latter 
the Creator of the world. They denied 
the incarnation and the resurrection, 
and rejected the books of the Old Tes- 
tament. 

CEREMONY, an assemblage of se- 
veral actions, forms, and circumstances, 
serving to render a thing magnificent 
and solemn. Applied to religious ser- 
vices, it signifies the external rites and 
manner wherein the ministers of reli- 
SJon perfonn their sacred functions. In 



CER 

1646, M. Ponce published a history of 
ancient ceremonies, tracing the risCy 
growth, and introduction of each rite 
mto the church, and its gradual ad- 
vancement to superstition. Many of 
them were borrowed from Judaism, but 
more from paganism. Dr. Middleton 
has given a fine discourse on the con- 
formitv between the pagan and popish 
ceremonies, which he exemplifies in the 
use of incense, holy water, lamps and 
candles before the shrines of saints, vo- 
tive gifts round the shrines of the de- 
ceased, Sec. In fact, tlie altars, images, 
crosses, processions, miracles, and le- 
gends, nay, even the veiy hierarchj-, 
pontificate, religious orders, Sec. of the 
present Romans, he shows, ai'e all co- 
pied from their heathen ancestors. An 
ample and magnificent representation 
in figures of the religious ceremonies 
and customs of all nations in the worlds 
designed by Picart, is added, with his- 
torical explanations, and many curious 
dissertations. 

It has been a question, whether we 
ought to use such rites and ceremonies 
which are merely of human appoint- 
ment. On one side it has been observed 
that we ought not. Christ alone is King 
in his church : he hath instituted such 
ordinances and forms of worship as he 
hath judged fit and necessary ; and to 
add to them seems, at least, to carry in 
it an imputation on his wisdom and au- 
thority, and hath this unanswerable ob- 
jection to it, that it opens the door to a 
thousand innovations (as the history of 
the church of Rome hath sufficiently 
shown,) which are not only indifferent 
in themselves, but highly absurd, and 
extremely detrimental to religion. That 
the ceremonies were numerous under 
the Old Testament dispensation is no 
argument; for, say they. 1. We respect 
Jewish ceremonies, because they were 
appointed of God ; and we reject human 
ceremonies, because God hath not ap- 
pointed them.— 2. The Jewish ceremo- 
nies were established by the universal 
consent of the nation ; human ceremo- 
nies are not so. — 3. The former were fit 
and proper for the purposes for which 
they Avere appointed ; but the latter are 
often the contraiy. — 4. The institutor of 
the Jewish ceremonies provided for the 
expense of it ; but no pri-ovision is made 
by God to support human ceremonies, 
or what he has not appointed. 

These arguments seem veiy power- 
fvil ; but on the other side it has been ob- 
served, that the desire of reducing reli- 
gious worship to the greatest possible 
simplicity, however rational it may ap- 
pear in itself» and abstractedly consider- 



CER

CHA 



ed, will be considerably moderated in 
such as bestow a mon^ent's attention 
upon the imperfection and infirmities of 
human nature in its present state. Man- 
kind, generally speaking, have too little 
elevation of niind to be much afl'ected 
with those forms and methods of wor- 
ship in which there is nothing striking 
to the outward senses. The great diffi- 
culty here lies in determining the length 
which it is pmdent to go in the accom- 
modation of religious ceremonies to hu- 
man mfirmity ; and the grand point is, 
to fix a medium in which a due regard 
mav be shown to the senses and imagi- 
nation, without violating the dictates of 
right reason, or tarnishing the purity of 
time religion. It has been said, that the 
Romish church has gene too far in its 
condescension to the infirmities of man- 
kind ; and this is what the ablest de- 
fenders of its -motley worship have alle- 
ged in its behalf. But this observation is 
not just ; the church of Rome has not so 
much accommodated itself to human 
iveak)iess, as it has abused that iveak- 
ness, by taking occasion from it to esta- 
blish an endless variety of ridiculous 
ceremonies, destructive of tine religion, 
and only adapted to promote the riches 
and despotism of the clergy, and to 
keep the nmltitude still hood-winked in 
their ignorance and superstition. Hovv^ 
far a just antipathy to the church pup- 
pet-shows of the Papists has unjustly 
driven some Protestant churches into 
the opposite extreme, is a matter that 
certauily deserves a serious considera- 
tion. See Dr. Sf.c?inett's Ser. on Con- 
formity to the World; Robinson's Ser- 
?non on Ceremonies ; Booth's Essay on 
the Kingdom of Christ ; Mosheim's Ec- 
clesiastical History ; tvith Mac Laine's

IVorks, vol. 4. p. 267. 

CERINTHIANS, ancient heretics, 
who denied the deity of Jesus Christ ; so 
named from Cerinthus. They believed 
that he was a mere man, the son of Jo- 
seph and Mary ; but that in his baptism 
a celestial virtue descended on him in 
the form of a dove ; by means whereof 
he was consecrated by the Holy Spirit, 
made Christ, and wrought so many mi- 
racles ; that, as he received it from hea- 
ven, it quitted him after his passion, and 
returned to the place whence it came ; 
so that Jesus, whom they called a fnire 
man, really died, and rose again ; but 
that Christ, who was distinguished from 
Jesus, did not suffer at all. ' It was part- 
ly to refute this sect that St. John wrote 
his Gospel. They received the Gospel 
of St. Matthew, to countenance their 
doctrine of ciroixcision j but they omit- 



ted the genealogy. They discarded the 
epistles of St. Paul, because that apos- 
tle held circumcision abolished. 

CHALDEE PARAPHRASE, in 
the rabbinical style, is called Targum. 
There are three Chaldee paraphrases 
in Walton's Polyglot: viz. 1. of On- 
kelos ; — 2. of Jonathan, son of Uziel ; — 3. 
of Jerusalem. See Bible, sect. 19, and 
Targum. 

CHALICE, the cup used to adminis- 
ter the wine in the sacrament, and by 
the Roman catholics in the mass. The 
use of the chalice, or communicating in 
both kinds, is by the chui'ch of Rome 
denied to the laity, who communicate 
only in one kind, the clergy alone being 
allowed the privilege of communicating 
in Ijoth kinds ; in direct opposition to our 
Saviour's words — "Drink ye all of it." 

CHANCE, a term we apply to events 
to denote that they happen without any 
necessary or foreknown cause. When 
we say a thing happens by chance, we 
mean no more than that its cause is un- 
known to us, and not, as some vainly 
imagine, that chance itself can be the 
cause of any thing. " The case of the 
painter," says Chambers, "who, unable 
to express the foam at the mouth of 
the horse he had painted, threw his 
sponge in despair at the piece, and by 
chance did that which he could not do 
before by design, is an eminent instance 
of what is called chance. Yet it is ob- 
yious all we here mean by chance, is, 
that the painter was not aware of the 
effect, or that he did not throw the 
sponge with such a view : not but. that 
he actually did every thing necessary to 
produce the effect ; insomuch that, con- 
sidering the direction wherein he threw 
the sponge, together ^vith its form and 
specific gravity, the colours wherewith 
it was smeared, and the distance of the 
hand from the piece, it was impossible, 
on the present system of things, that the 
effect should not follow." — ^The word, 
as it is often used by the unthinking, is 
vague and indeterminate — a mere name 
for nothing. 

CHANCELLOR, a lay officer under 
a bishop, who is judge of his court. In 
the first ages of the church the bishops 
had those officers, who were called 
church lav/yers, and were bred up in 
the knowledge of the civil and canon 
law : their business was to assist the 
bishop in his diocese. — We read of no 
chancellors till Henry the Second's 
time ; but that the king requiring the 
attendance of the'bishcps in his councils, 
it was thf^ught necessary to substitute 
chancellors in then* room for the des- 
patch of bubincss.

CHANT is used for the vocal music 
of churches. In church history we meet 
with divers kinds of these; as, 1. Chant 
Ambrosimi, estatflislied bv St. Ambrose ; 
— 2. Chant Gregorian, introduced by 
pope Gregory the Great, who establish- 
ed schools of chanters, and corrected 
the church music. This, at first, was 
called the Ro/ndn song; afterwards 
the/? /am song; as the choir and people 
sing in unison. 

CHAOS, the mass of matter sup- 
posed to l.&gt;e in confusion before it was 
divided by the Almighty into its proper 
classes and elements. It does not ap- 
pear who first asserted the notion of a 
chaos. Mcses, the earliest of all writers, 
derives the oi'igin of this world from 
a confusion of matter, dark, void, deep, 
■without form, which }ie calls TOHJ 
BOHU ; which is precisely the chaof} 
'of the Greek and barbarian philoso- 
'phers. Moses goes no farther than the 
chaos, nor tells us Avhence it took its 
origin, or whence its confused state ; 
and where Moses stops, there precisely 
do all the rest. 

CHAPEL, a place of worship. — 
There are various kinds of cha/ie/s in 
Britain. 1. Domestic chapels, built by 
noblemen or gentlemen foiMirivate wor- 
.ship in their families. — 2. Free chapels, 
such as are ffiunded by kings of England. 
They are free from all episcopal juris- 
diction, and only to be visited by the 
founder and his successors, which is 
done by the lord chancellor: yet the 
king may license any subject to build 
and endow a chapel, and by letters pa- 
tent exempt it frohi tlie visitation of the 
ordinary.— 3. Chapels in universities 
belonging to particular univei-sities. — 
4. Chapels of ease, built for the ease of 
one or more parishioners that dwell too 
far from the church, and are served by 
inferior curates, provided for at the 
charge of the rector, or of such as have 
benefit by it, as the composition or cus- 
tom is. — 5. Parochial chapels, which dif- 
fer from parish churches only in name : 
they are generally small, and the inhabi- 
tants within the district few. If there be 
a presCTitation ad ccclpsiam instead of 
ca/icllam, and un admission and institu- 
tion upon it, it is no longer a chapel, but 
a church for themselves and families. — 
6. Chapels whicli adjoin to and are part 
of the cliurch : sucli were formerly built 
by honourable persons as burying pla- 
ces. — 7. The places of worship belong- 
ing to ti\e Calvinistic and Arminian 
Methodists are also generally called 
cha];)els, though they are licensed in no 
rrther ''av than the meetings of the 
Protestant Dissenters, 



CHAPIj AIN, a person who peiforrns 
divine service in a chapel, or is retained 
in the service of some family to per- 
foiTTi divine service. 

As to the origin of chaplains, some 
say the shrines of relics were anciently 
covered with a kind of tent, cape, or 
cafiella, i. e. little cape ; and that hence 
the priests who had the care of them 
were called chaplains. In time, these 
relics were reposited in a little church, 
either contiguous to a larger, or sepa- 
rate from it ; and the name capella, 
which v/as gi\fen to the cover, was 
also given to tlie place where it was 
lodged ; and hence the priest who su- 
perintended it came to be called capel- 
j lamis, or chaplain. 

According to a statute of Henry VIII. 
the persons vested with a power of re- 
taining chaplains, together with the 
number each is allowed to qualify, are 
as follow : an archbishop eight ; a duke 
or bishop six ; marquis or earl five ; vis- 
count four ; baron, knight of the garter, 
or lord chancellor, three : a duchess, 
marchioness, countess, baroness, the 
treasurer or comptroller of the king's 
house, clerk of the closet, the king's se- 
cretary, dean of the chapel, almoner, 
and master of the rolls, eacli of them two; 
chief justice of the king's bench, and 
ward of the cinque ports, each one. All 
these chaplains may purchase a license 
Or dispensation, and take two benefices, 
with cure of souls. A chaplain must be 
retained by letters testimonial undei' 
hand and seal, for it is not sufficient that 
he serve as chaplain in the family. 

In Engla'hd there are foi-ty-eight 
chaplains to the king, who wait four 
each month, preach in the chapqj, read 
the service to the family, and to the king 
in his private oratory, and say grace in 
the absence of the clerk of the closet. 
While in waiting, thev li^ve a table and 
attendance, bxit no salary. In Scotland, 
the king has six chaplains with a salary 
of 50/. each ; three of them having in 
addition tlie deanery of the chapel royal 
divided betv^een them, making up above 
100/. to each. Their only duty at pre- 
sent is to say prayers at the election of 
peers for Scotland to sit in parliament. 

CHAPLET, a certain instrument of 
piety made use of by the papists. It is a 
string of beads, by which tliey measure 
or count tlie number of their'prayers. 

CHAPTER, a comnumity of eccle- 
siastics l^elonging to a cathedral or col- 
legiate church. The chief or head of 
the chapter is the dean ; the body con- 
sists of canons or prebendaries. The 
chapter has now no longer a place in

the bishop to his clergj- ; — 2. Among

CHARITY, one of the three grand ' 
theological graces, consisting in the lo\'e 
of God and our neighbour, or the haliit 
or disposition of loving God Avith all our 
heart, and our neighbour as ourselves. 
" Charity" says an able writer, " con- 
sists not in speculative ideas of general 
benevolence floating in the head, and 
leaving the heart, as speculations often 
do, untouched and cold : neither is it 
confined to that indolent good naaire 
whicli makes us rest satisfied with being 
free from inveterate malice, or ill will to 
our fellow creatiires, without prompting 
us to be of service to any. True charit)' 
is an active principle. It is not proper- 
ly a single virtue; but a disposition resi- 
ding in the heart as a fountain; whence 
all tlie virtues of benigniity, candour, for- 
bearance, generosity, compassion, and li- 
beralitj' flow as so many native streams. 
From general good will' to all, it extends 
its hiflucnce particularly to those with 
Avhom we stand in nearest connexion, 
and who are directly within the sphere 
of our good offices. From tlie country 
or community to which we belong, it 
descends to the smaller associates of 
neighbourhood, relations, and friends ; 
and spreads itself over the whole circle 
of social and domestic life. I mean not 
that it imports a promiscuous undistin- 
guishing affection which gives every 
man an equal title to our love. Charity, 
if we should endeavour to cany it so far, 
would !)e rendered an impracticable vir- 
tue, and would resolve itself into mere 
words, without affecting the heart. True 
charity attempts not to shut our e-\'es to 
the distinction between good and bad 
men ; nor to vrarm our hearts equally 
to those who befriend and those who 
injure us. It reserves our esteem for 
ijood men, and our complacency for our 
triends. Towards our enemies, it in- 
spires forgiveness and humanit)'. It 
breathes universal candour and liberali- 
ty of sentiment. It forms gentleness of 
temper, find dict.ates affability of man- 
ners. It prompts con-esponding sym- 
pathies with them who rejoice, and them 
Avho weep. It teaches us to slight and 
despise no man. Charity is the com- 
forter of the afflicted, the protector of 
the oppressed, the reconciler of differ- 
ences, the intercessor for offenders. It 
is faithfulness in the friend, public spirit 



in the magistrate, equity and patience 
in the judge, moderation in the sove- 
reign, and loyalty in the subject. In 
parents it is care and attention ; in chil- 
dren it is reverence and submission. In 
a word, it is the soul of social life. It is 
the sun that enlivens and cheers the 
abodes of men ; not a meteor which oc- 
casionally glares, but a luminary, which 
in its orderly and regular course dispen- 
ses a benignant influence." See Bar- 
I'oiv's JVorks, vol. i. ser. 27, 28. Blair's

CHARM, a kind of spell, supposed 
hv the ignorant to have an irresistible 
influence, by m.eans of the concun-ence 
of some infernal powei', both on the 
minds, lives, and properties of those 
whom it has for its'oljject. 

"Certain vain ceremonies," says Dr. 
Doddridge, " which are commonly call- 
ed charms, and seem to have no efficacy 
at all for producing the effects proposed 
by them, are to be aA^oided ; seeing if 
there be indeed vcnj veal efficacy in them, 
it is gcneralh- probable they owe it to 
some bad cause ; for one can hardly 
imagine that God ' should permit gooci 
angels in any extraordinary manner to 
interpose, or should immediately exert 
his own miraculous power on trifling- 
occasions, and upon the performance ot 
such idle trick-s as are generally made 
the condition of receiving such benefits." 

CHASTITY,purity A-om fleshly lust. 
In men it is termed continence. See 
Continence. There is a chastity of 
speech, behaviour, and imagination, as 
well as of body. Grove gives us the fol- 
lowing niles for the consen^ation of 
chastity. — 1. To keep ourselves fully 
employed in labours either of the body 
or the mind: idleness is frequently the 
introduction to sensuality, — 2. I'o guard 
the senses, and avoid every thing which 
may be an inceMti\'e to lust. Dots the 
free use of some meats and drinks make 
the body ungovernable i* Does reading 
certain books deliauch the imagination 
and inflame the passions? Do tempta- 
tions often enter by the sight ? Have 
public ])lays, dancings, effeminate nni- 
sic, idle songs, loose hal^its, and the like, 
the same effect ? He who resohes iipou 
chastity cannot \w it^norant what his du- 
ty is in" all these and such like cases. — 
3. To implore the Divine Spirit, which 
is a spirit of purity ; and by the utmost 
regai-d to his presence and operations 
to' endeavour to retain him with us.

CHEATS ai-e deceitM practices, in 
defrauding, or endeavouring to defraud, 
another ot liis known right, by means of 
some artful device contrary to honesty. 
See Honesty, Justice. 

CHEERFULNESS, a disposition of 
mind free from dejection. Opposed to 
gloominess. If we consider cheerfulness, 
says Addison, in thi-ee lights, with re- 
gard to ourselves, to those we convei-se 
Avith, and to the Great Author of our 
being, it will not a little recommend it- 
self on each of these accounts. The man 
who is possessed of this excellent frame 
of mind is not only easy in his thoughts, 
but a perfect master of all the powers 
and faculties of his soul ; his imagination 
is always clear, and his judgment undis- 
turbed ; his temper is even and unniffled, 
whether in action or in solitude. He 
comes with a relish to all those goods 
which Nature has provided for him, 
tastes all the pleasures of the creation 
■which are poured about him, and does 
not feel the full v/eight of those evils 
which may befall him. See Happiness, 
Joy. 

CHILDREN, duties of, to parents. 
Dr. Doddi'idge observes, " 1. That as 
children have received important fa- 
vours from their parents, gratitude, and 
therefore virtue, requires that they 
should love them. — 2. Considering the 
superiority of age, and the probable su- 
periority of wisdom, wliich there is on 
the side of parents, and also how much 
the satisfaction and comfort of a parent 
depend on the res])cct shown him by his 
children, it is fit that children should 
reverence their parer.ts. — 3. It is fit that, 
while the parents arc living, and the use 
of their understanding continued, their 
children should not ordinarily under- 
take any matter of great importance, 
without advising with them, or without 
vtvy cogent reasons pursue it contrary 
to their consent. — i. As young people 
need some guidance and govenmient in 
their minority, and as there is some pe- 
culiar reason to trust the prudence, care, 
and affection of a parent, preferable to 
any other person, it is reasonable that 
children, especiallv while in their mino- 
rity, should obey their parents ; without 
which neither the order of families, nor 
the happiness of the rising generation 
could be secured: nevertheless, still sup- 
posing that the commands of the parent 
are not inconsistent w'th the will of 
God. — 5. Virtue reqviires that, if parents 



come to want, children should take care 
to furnish them with the necessaries of 
life, and, so far as their ability will per- 
mit, with the conveniences of it." Dod-

CHOREPISCOPI (xflf xw?&lt;" wisKojToi, 
bishops of the country.) In the ancient 
church, when the dioceses became en- 
larged by the conversions of pagans in 
the country, and villages at a great dis- 
tance from the city church, the bishops 
appointed themselves certain assistants, 
whom they called Cho7-e/iisco/ii,hec2Mse. 
by their office they were bishops of the 
country. There have been great dis- 
putes among the leaiTied concerning 
this order, some thinking that they 
were mere presbyters ; others that 
there were two sorts, some that had re- 
ceived episcopal ordination, and some 
that were presbyters only ; others think 
that thev were all bishops. 

CHRISM, oil consecrated by the 
bishop, and used in the Romish and 
Greek churches in the administration 
of baptism, confirmation, ordination, and 
extreme imction. 

CHRIST, the Lord and Saviour of 
mankind. He is called Christ, or Mes- 
siah, because he is anointed, sent, and 
furnished by God to execute his media- 
torial office. See Jesus Christ. 

CHRISTIAN, by Dr. Johnson, is 
defined, " a professor of the religion of 
Christ ;" but in reality a Christian is 
more than a professor of Christianity. 
He is one who imbibes the spint, parti- 
cipates the grace, and is obedient to the 
will of Christ. 

The disciples and followers of Christ 
were first denominated Christians at 
Antioch, A. D. 42. The first Christians 
distinguished themselves in the most 
remarkable manner, by their conduct 
and their virtues. The faithful, whom 
the preaching of St. Peter had convert- 
ed, hearkened attentively to the exhor- 
tations, of the apostles, who failed not 
carefully to instruct them as persons 
who were entering upon an entire new 
life. They attended the temple daily, 
doing nothing different from the other 
Jews, because it was yet not time to se- 
parate from them. But they made a still 
greater progress in virtue; for they sold 
all that they possessed, and distributed 
their goods to the wants of their breth- 
ren. Tlie primitive Christians were not 
onlv remarkable for the consistency of 
their conduct, but were also very emi- 
nently distinguished by the many mira- 
culous gifts and gi-aces bestowed by 
God upon them. 

The Jews were the first and the most

inveterate enemies the Christians had. 
'I'hev put them to death as often as they 
had it in their power ; and when they 
revolted against the Romans, in the time 
of the emperor Adrian, Barchochebas, 
who was at the head of that revolt, em- 
ployed against the Christians the most 
rigorous punislinients to compel them 
to'blaspheme and renounce Jesus Clirist. 
And we find that even in the third cen- 
tury thev endeavoured to get into their 
hands Christian women, in order to 
scourge and stone them in their syna- 
gogues. They cursed the Christians 
three times a day in their sjmagogues; 
and their iiibbins would not sufler them 
to converse with Chiistians upon any 
occasion ; nor were they contented to 
hate and detest them, but they dispatch- 
ed emissaries all over the world to de- 
fame the Christians and spread all sorts 
of calumnies against them. They ac- 
cused them among other things, of wor- 
shipping the sun, and the head of an 
ass; they reproached them with idle- 
ness, and being a useless set of people. 
Tliey charged them with treason, and 
endeavouring to erect a new monarchy 
ngainst that of the Romans. They af- 
firmed that in celebrating their myste- 
ries, they used to kill a child, and eat 
his flesh. They accused them of the 
most shocking incests, and of intempe- 
rance in their feasts of charity. But the 
lives and behaviour of the first Chris- 
tians were sufficient to refute all that 
was said against them, and evidently de- 
monstrated that these accusations were 
mere calumny, and the effect of invete- 
rate malice. Pliny the Younger, who 
was governor of Pontus and Bith}'nia 
between the years 103 and 105, gives a 
very particular account of the Chris- 
tians m that province, in a letter which 
lie wrote to the emperor Trajan, of 
which the following is an extract: "I 
take the liberty. Sir, to give you an ac- 
count of every difficulty which arises to 
me: I had never been present at the 
examinations of the Christians; for 
which reason I knOAV not what questions 
have been put to them, nor in what 
manner they have been punished. My 
behaviour towards those who have been 
accused to me has been this ; I have 
interrogated them, in order to know 
■whether they were really Christians. 
When they have confessed it, I have re- 
peated the same question two or tliree 
times, threatening them with death if 
they did not renounce this religion. 
Those who have persisted in their con- 
fession have been by my order led to 
punishment. I have even met with some 
Roman citizens guilty of this phrenzy, 



whom, in regard to their quality, I have 
set apart from the rest, in order to send 
them to Rome. These persons declare 
that their whole crime, if they are guil- 
ty, consists in this : That on certain days 
they assemble before sun-rise, to sin^ 
alternately the praises of Christ, as ot 
God ; and to oblige themselves, by the 
performance of their religious rites, not 
to be guiltv of theft or adulteiy, to ob- 
serve inviolably flieir word, and to be 
true to tlieir trust. Th is disposition has 
obliged me to endeavour to inform my- 
self still farther of this matter, by put- 
ting to the torture two of tlieir women 
servants, whom they called deaconesses; 
but I could learn nothing move from 
tliem than that the superstition of these 
people is as ridiculous as their attach- 
ment to it is astonishing." 

It is easy to tliscover the cause of the 
many persecutions to which the Chris- 
tians' were exposed during the first three 
centuries. The purity of the Christian 
morality, directly opposite to the cor- 
ruption of the pagans, was doubtless one 
of the most powerful motives of the pub- 
lic aversion. To this may be added the 
many calumnies unjustly spread about 
concerning them by their enemies, par- 
ticularly the Jews ; and this occasioned 
so strong a prejudice against them, that 
the pagans condemned them without en- 
quiring into their doctrine, or permitting 
them to defend themselves. Besides, 
their worshipping Jesus Christ as God, 
was contrary to one of the most ancient 
laws of the Roman empire, which ex- 
pressly forbade the acknowledging of 
any God which had not been approved 
of "by the senate. But, notwithstanding 
the violent opposition made to the esta- 
blishment ot the Christian religion, it 
gained ground daily and verv soon made 
surprising progress in the Roman em- 
pire. In the third century there were 
Christians in the senate, in the camp, in 
the palace ; in short every where but in 
the temple and the theatres; they filled 
the towns, the country, the islands. Men 
and women of all ages and conditions, and 
even those of the first dignities, embra- 
ced the faith ; insomuch that the pagans 
complained that the revenues of their 
temples were mined. They were in such 
great numbers in the empire, that (as^ 
TertuUian expresses it) were they to 
have retired into another countrj', they 
would have left the Romans only a fright- 
ful solitude. For persecutions of the 
Christians, see article Persecution. 

Christians mav be considered as nomi- 
nal and rea/. There are vast numbers 
who are called Christians, not because 
they possess any love for Christ, h-j*.

becnuse they happen to he born in a 
Christian country, educated Ijy Chris- 
tian parents, aiid sometimes attend 
Christian worship. Tliere are also 
many whose minds are well informed 
respecting the Cliristian system, who 
prefer it to every other, and who make 
an open profession of it ; and yet, after 
all, teel but little of the real power of 
Christianity. A ?•«// Christian is one 
whose understanding is enlightened by 
the influences of divine grace, who is 
convinced of the depravity of his nature, 
who sees his own inability to help him- 
self, who is taught to behold God as the 
chief good, the Lord Jesus as the only 
way to obtain felicity, and that the Holy 
Spirit is tlie grand agent in apjjlying the 
blessings of the Gospel to. his sovd. His 
heait is renovated, and inclined to re- 
, vere, honour, worship, trust in, and live to 
God. His affections are ele\'ated above 
the world, and centre in God alone. He 
embraces him as his portion, loves him 
sujiremely, and is zealous in tlie defence 
and support of his cause. His temper 
is regulated, liis powers I'oused to vigo- 
rous action, his thoughts si;ii-itual, and 
his general deportment amialile and 
uniform. In fine, the true Christian 
chai'acter exceeds all others as much as 
the blaze of the meridian sun outshines 
the feeble light of the glow-worm. 

CHRISTIANS of' ST. JOHN, a 
sect of Christians very numerous in Bal- 
fara, and the neighbouring towns : they 
formerly inhabited along the river Jor- 
dan, where St. John ba]itized, and it was 
from thence they had their name. They 
hold an anniversary feast of five days, 
during which they all go to the bishop, 
who baptizes them with the baptism of 
St. John. Their bajjtism is also per- 
formed in rivers, and that only on Sun- 
days: they have no notion of the third 
person in the Trinity; nor have they 
any canonical book, but abundance full 
of charms, &amp;c. Their bishoprics de- 
scend by inheritance as our estates do, 
though they have the ceremony of an 
election. 

CHRISTIANS OF ST. THOMAS, 
a sort of Christians in a peninsula of 
India on this side the gulf; they inhabit 
chiefly at Cranganor, and the neigh- 
boui'ing country; these admit of no 
images, and receive only the cross, to 
which they pay a great veneration. 
They affirm, that the souls of the saints 
do not see God till after the day of judg- 
ment ; they acknowledge but three sa- 
craments, viz. baptism, orders, and the 
eucharist ; they make no use of holy 
oils in the administration of Ijaptism, but 
after the ceremonv, anoint the infant 



with an unction composed of oil and 
walnuts, without any benediction. In 
the eucharist they consecrate with little 
cakes made of oil and salt, and instead 
of wine nuike use of water in which 
raishis have been infused.

! I. Christianity, foundation of. 
Most, if not all Christians, whate^'er 
their particular tenets may be, acknow- 
ledge the Scriptures of the Old and 
New Testaments as the sole foundation 
of their faith and pi'actice. But as these 
books, or at least particular passages hi 
them, have frojii the ambiguity of lan- 
guage been variousl)- interpreted by dif- 
ferent commentators, these diversities 
have given birth to a multiplicity of dif-» 
ferent sects. These, however, or at 
least the greatest number of them, ap- 
peal to the Scriptures of the Old and 
New Testaments as the ultimate stan- 
dard, the only infallible rule of faith and 
manners. If asked by what authority 
these books claim an absolute right to 
detersnine the consciences and under- 
standings of men with regard to what 
they should believe, and what they 
should do, they answer, that all Scrip- 
ture, whether for doctrine, correction 
or T'cjiroof, was given by immediate in- 
spiration from God. If again interroga- 
ted how those books which they call 
Scripture are authenticated, they reply, 
that the Old and New I'estaments are 
proved to be the word of God, by evi- 
dences Ijoth external and internal. See 
§ 2. and article Revelation. 

II. Christianity, evidences of the 
truth of. The exteinal evidences of the 
authenticity and divine authority of the 
Scriptures have been divided into direct 
and collateral. The direct evidences 
are such as arise from the nature, con- 
sistency, and probability of the facts; 
and from the simplicity, vuiiformity, 
competency, and fidelity of the testimo- 
nies by which they are supported. The 
collateral evidences are either the same 
occui-rences supported by heathen tes- 
timonies, or others which concur with 
and corroborate the history of Chris- 
tianity. Its internal evidences arise 
either fi'om its exact confoi-mity with

the character of God, from its aptitude 
to the frame and circumstances of man, 
or from those supernatural convictions 
and assistances which are impressed on 
the mind by the immediate operation of 
the Divine Spirit. We shall here chiefly 
follow Dr. Doddridge, and endeavour to 
give some of the chief evidences which 
have been brought forward, and which 
every unprejudiced mind must confess 
are unanswerable. 

First. Taking the matter merely in 
theory, it will appear highly probable 
that such a system as the Gospel should 
be, indeed, a divine revelation. 

1. The case of mankind is naturally 
such as to need a divine revelation, 1 
John V. 19. Rom. i. Eph. iv. — 2. Thei-e 
is from the light of nature considerable 
encouragement to hope that God would 
favour his creatures with so needful a 
blessing as a revelation appears. — 3. 
We may easily conclude, that if a re- 
velation were given, it would be intro- 
duced and transmitted in such a man- 
ner as Christianity is said to have been. 
— 4. That the main doctrines of the 
Gospel are of such a nature as we might 
in general suppose those of a divine re- 
velation would be ; rational, practical, 
and sublime, Heb. xi. 6. Mark xii. 20. 
1 Tim. ii. 5. Matt. v. 48. Matt. x. 29, 
30. Philippians iv. 8. Romans ii. 6, 40. 

Secondly. It is, in fact, certain that 
Christianity is indeed, a divine revela- 
tion; for, I. The books of the A''ew Tes- 
tament, now in our hands, were written 
di/ the /irst preachers and publishers of 
Christianity. In proof of this, observe, 

I. That it is certain that Christianity is 
not a new religion, but that it was main- 
tained by great multitudes quickly after 
the time in which Jesus is said to have 
appeared. — 2. That there was certainly 
such a person as Jesus of Nazareth, who 
was cmcified at Jerusalem, when Pon- 
tius Pilate was governor there. — 3. The 
first publishers of this religion wrote 
books which contained an account of 
the life and doctrine of Jesus, their mas- 
ter, and which went by the name of those 
that now make up our New Testament. 
— 4. That the books of the New Tes- 
tament have been presen-ed, in the 
main, uncorrupted to the present time, 
in the original language in which they 
were written. — 5. That the translation 
of them now in our hands may be de- 
pended upon as, in all things most ma- 
terial, agreeable to the original. Now, 

II. From allowing the J^ew Testament to 
be genuine, according to the abox&gt;e proof, 
it will certainly follow that Christiariity 
is a divine revelation ; for, in the first 
place, it is exceedingly evident that the 



writers of the New Testament certainly 
knew whether the facts were true oV 
false. John i. 3. John xix. 27, 35. Acts 
xxvii. 7, 9.-2. That the character of 
these writers, so far as we can judge by 
their works, seems to render them wor- 
tliy of regard, and leaves no room to 
imagine they intended to deceive us. 
The manner in which they tell their 
story is most happily adapted to gain 
our belief. There is no air of declama- 
tion and harangue ; nothing that looks 
like artifice and design: no apologies, 
no encomiums, no characters, no re- 
flections, no digressions ; but the facts 
are recounted with great simplicity, just 
as thev seem to have happened ; and 
those facts are left to speak for them- 
selves. — Their integrity likewise evi- 
dently appears in the freedom with 
wliich they mention those circumstances 
which m.ight have exposed their Master 
and themselves to the gi'eatest contempt 
amongst prejudiced and inconsiderate 
men, such as they knew they must ge- 
nerally expect to meet with. John i. 45, 
46. John vii. 52. Luke ii. 4, 7. Mark 
vi. 3. Matt. viii. 20. John vii. 48. " It is 
certain that there are in their writings 
the most genuine traces not only of a 
plain and honest, but a most pious and 
devout, a most benevolent and generous 
disposition, as every one must acknow- 
ledge who reads their writings. — 3. The 
apostles were under no temptation to 
forge a story of this kind, or to publish 
it to the world knowing it to be talse. — 
4. Had they done so, humanly speaking, 
they must quickly have perished in it, 
and their foolish cause must have died 
with them, without ever gaining any 
credit in the world. Reflect more par- 
ticularly on the nature of those grand 
facts, the death, resurrection, and exal- 
tation of Christ, which formed the great 
foundation of the Christian scheme, as 
first exhibited by the apostles. The 
resun-ection of a dead man, and his as- 
cension into an abode in the upper 
world, were such strange things, that a 
thousand objections would immediately 
have been raised against them ; and 
some extraordinary proof would have 
been justly required as a balance to 
them. Consider the manner in which 
the apostles undertook to prove the 
trath of their testimony to these facts ; 
and it will evidently appear, that, iii- 
stead of confirming' then- scheme, it 
must have been sufficient utterly to have 
overthrown it, had it been itself the 
most probable imposture that the wit of 
man could ever have contrived. See 
Acts iii. ix. xiv. xix. Sec. They did not 
merely assert that tl;ev had seen mira- 
M

CHK 



cks wrought by Jesus, but th;it he had 
endowed them with a variety of mii'a- 
culous powers ; and these tliey under- 
took to display not in such idle and use- 
less tricks as slight of hand miglit per- 
form, but in such solid and important 
works as appeared worthy of divine 
interposition, and entirely "superior to 
human power. Nor were these things 
undertaken in a corner, in a circle of 
friends or dependants ; nor were they 
said to be Avrought, as miglit be sus- 
pected, by any confedei'ates in the 
fraud ; but they were done often in the 
most public manner. Would impostors 
have made such pretensions as these .'' 
or, if they had, must they not imme- 
diately have been exposed and ruined ? 
Now, if the New Testament be genuine, 
then it is certain that the apostles pre- 
tend to have wrouglit miracles in the 
very presence of those to Avhom their 
writings were addressed ; nay, more, 
they profess likewise to have conferred 
those miraculous gifts in some consi- 
derable degrees on others, even on the 
very persons to whom they write, and 
they 'appeal to their consciences as to 
the truth of it. And could there possiblv 
be room for delusion here ? — 5. It is 
likewise certain that the apostles did 
gain early credit, and succeeded in a 
most wonderful manner. This is abim- 
dantly proved by the vast number of 
churches established in early ages at 
Rome, Corinth, Ephesus, Collosse, Sec. 
&amp;c. &amp;c. — 6. That, admitting the facts 
which they testified concerning Christ 
to be true, then it was reasonable for 
their contemporaries, and is reasonable 
for us, to receive the Gospel which tiiey 
liaye transmitted to us as a divine reve- 
lation. The great thing they asserted 
was, that Jesus was the Christ, and that 
he was proved to be so by prophecies 
accomplished in him, and by miracles 
wrought by him, and by others in his 
name. If we attend to these, we shall 
find them to be no contemptible argu- 
ments ; but must be forced to acknow- 
ledge, that, the premises being esta- 
blished, the conclusion most easily and 
necessarily follows; and this conclusion, 
that Jesus is the Christ, taken in all its 
extent, is an abstract of the Gospel re- 
velation, and therefore is sometimes put 
for the whole of it, Acts viii. 2,7. Acts 
xvii. 18. See Articles Miracle and 
Prophecy.— 7. The truth of the Gos- 
pel has also received farther and very 
considerable confirmation from what has 
happened in the Avorld since it was first 
published. And here we must desire 
eveiy one to consider what God has 
been doing to coi\firm the Gospel since 



its first publication, and he will find it a 
farther evidence of its Divine original. 
We might argue at large fi'om its sur- 
prising propagation in the world ; from 
the miraculous powers with which not 
only the apostles, but succeeding preach- 
ers of the Gospel, and other converts, 
were endowed ; from the accomplish- 
ment of prophecies recorded in the New 
Testament ; and from the preser\'ation 
of the Jews as a distinct people, not with- 
standing the various difnculties and 
persecutions through which tliey have 
passed. We must not, however, forget 
to mention the confirmation it receives 
from the methods which its enemies 
have taken to destroy it; and these have 
generally been either persecution of 
falsehood, or cavilling at som.e ])articu- 
lars in revelation, without entering into 
the grand argument on which it is built, 
and fairly debating what is offered in its 
defence. The cause has gained con- 
siderably by the opposition made to. it: 
the more it has been tried, the more it 
has been a])proved : and we are bold to 
sa)^ no honest man, unfettered by preju- 
dice, can examine this system in all its 
parts, without being convinced that its 
origin is divine. 

ill. Christiaxity, general doc- 
trines of. "It must be obvious," says an 
ingenious authoi-, "to every refleJcting 
mind, that, whether we attempt to form 
the idea of any religion a firiori, or con- 
template those which have already been 
exhibited, certain facts, principles, or 
data, must oe pre-established ; from 
whence will I'esult a particular frame 
of mind and course of action suitable to 
the character and dignity of that Being 
by whom the religion is enjoined, and 
adapted to the nature and situation of 
those agents, who are commanded to 
observe it. Ilence Christiaiiitu may be 
divided into credenda or doctrines, and 
agenda or precepts. As the great foun- 
dation of his i-eligion, therefore, the 
Christian believes the existence and 
government of one eternal and infinite 
Essence, which for ever retains in itself 
the cause of its own existence, and in- 
herently possesses all those perfections 
which are compatible with its nature ; 
such are its almighty power, omniscient 
wisdom, infinite justice, boundless good- 
ness, and universal presence. In this 
indivisible essence the Christian recog- 
nises three distinct subsistences, yet dis- 
tinguished in such a manner as not to be 
incompatible either with essential unity, 
or simplicity of being, or with their 
personal distinction ; each of them pos- 
sesses the same nature and properties 
to the same extent. This infinite Being 



CHR 



91 



CHR 



was graciously pleased to ci'cate an uni- 
verse replete with intelligences, who 
might enjoy his glory, participate his 
happiness, and imitate his perfections. 
But as these beings were not immutable, 
but left to the freedom of their own 
will, degeneracy took place, and that in 
a rank of intelligence superior to man. 
But guilt is never stationary. Impatient 
of itself, and cursed with its own feel- 
ings, it proceeds from bad to worse, 
whilst the poignancy of its torments in- 
creases with the number of its perpe- 
trations. Such was the situation of Sa- 
tan and his apostate angels, Tliey at- 
tempted to transfer their tuipitude and 
misery to man, and were, alas, but too 
successful ! Hence the heterogeneous 
and irreconcilable principles which ope- 
rate in his nature ; hence that inexpli- 
cable medley of wisdom and folly, of 
rectitude and eiTor, of benevolence and 
malignity, of sincerity and fraud, exhi- 
bited through his whole conduct; hence 
the darkness of his understanding, the 
depi-avity of his will, the pollution of 
his heart, the irregularity of his affec- 
tions, and the absolute subversion of his 
whole internal economy. The seeds of 
perdition soon ripened into overt acts 
of guilt and hoiTor. All the hostilities of 
nature were confronted, and the whole 
sublunary creation became a theatre of 
disorder and mischief. Here the Chris- 
tian once more appeals to fact and ex- 
perience. If these things are so; if man 
be the vessel of guilt, and the victinti of 
misery, he demands how this constitu- 
tion of things can be accounted for? how 
can it be supposed that a being so wicked 
and unliappy should be the production 
of an infinitely good and infinitely per- 
fect Creator ? He therefore insists that 
human nature must have been disar- 
ranged and contaminated by some vio- 
lent shock ; and that, of consequence, 
without the light diffused over tlie face 
of things by Christianity, all nature must 
remain in inscrutable and inexplicable 
mysterv. To redress these evils, to re- 
establish the empire of rectitude and 
happiness, to restore the nature of man 
to its primitive dignity, to satisfy the re- 
monstrances of infinite justice, to purify 
every original or contracted stain, to 
expiate the guilt and destroy the power 
of vice, the eternal Son of God, from 
whom Christianity takes its name, and 
to whom it owes its origin, descended 
from the bosom of his Father, assumed 
the human nature, became the repre- 
sentative of man ; endured a severe pro- 
bation in that character; exhibited a 
pattern of perfect righteousness, and 
«t last ratified his doctrine, and fully ac- 



complished all the ends of his mission, 
by a cruel, unmerited, and ignominious 
death. Before he left the world, he 
delivered the doctrines of salvation, and 
the rules of human conduct, to his apos- 
tles, whom he empowered to instruct 
the world in all that concerned their 
eternal felicit}', and whom he invested 
with miraculous gifts to ascertain the 
I'eality of what they taught. To them 
he likewise promised another comfort- 
er, even the Divine Spirit, who should 
remove the darkness, console the woes, 
and purify the stains of human nature. 
Having remained for a part of three 
days under the power of death, he rose 
again from the grave ; appeared to his 
disciples, and many others; conversed 
with them for some time, then re-as- 
cended to heaven; from whence the 
Christian expects him, according to his 
]:)i*omise, to appear as the Sovereign 
Judge of the living and the dead, from 
whose awards there is no appeal, and 
by whose sentence the destiny of the 
i-ighteous and the wicked shall be eter- 
nally fixed. Soon after his departure 
to the right hand of his Father (where 
in his human nature he sits supreme of 
all created beings, and invested with the 
absolute administration of heaven and 
earth,) the Spirit of grace and consola- 
tion descended on his apostles with visi- 
ble signatures of divine power and pre- 
sence. Nor were his salutary opera- 
tions confined to them, but extended to 
all who did not Ijy obstinate guilt repel 
his influences. These, mdeed, wei'e less 
conspicuous than at the glorious 2cra 
when they were visibly exhibited in the 
persons of the apostles. But, though 
his energy be less observable, it is by 
no means less effectual to all the pur- 
poses of grace and mercy. The Chris- 
tian is convinced that there is and shall 
continue to be a society upon earth, 
who worship God as revealed in Jesus 
Christ, who believe his doctrines, who 
observe his precepts, and who shall be 
saved by the merits of his death, in the 
use of these external means of salvation 
whicli he hath appointed. He also be- 
lieves that the sacraments of baptism 
and the Lord's supper, the interpreta- 
tion and application of Scripture, the 
habitual exercise of public and private 
devotion, are obviously calculated to dif- 
fuse and promote the interests of truth 
and religion by superinducing the salu- 
tary habits of faith, love, and repentance. 
He is firmly persuaded, that, at the con- 
summation" of all things, when tlie pur- 
poses of Providence in the various revo- 
lutions of progressive nature are ac- 
complished, the whole human race shall

once more issue from their graves; 
some to immortal felicity in the actual 
perception and enjoyment of their 
Creator's presence, and others to ever- 
lasting shame and misery." 

IV. Christianity, morality aiid su- 
periority of. It has been well observed, 
" that the two gi-and principles of ac- 
tion, according to the Christian, are the 
love of God, which is the sovereign pas- 
sion in every gracious mind ; and the 
love of man, which regulates our ac- 
tions accoi'ding to the various relations 
in which we stand, whether to commu- 
nities or individuals. This sacred con- 
nection ought never to be totally extin- 
guished by any temporary injury. It 
ought to subsist in some degree even 
amongst enemies. It requires that we 
should pardon the offences of others, 
as we expect pardon for our own ; 
and that we should no farther resist 
evil than is necessary for the preser- 
vation of personal rights and social 
happiness. It dictates every relative 
and reciprocal duty between parents 
and children, masters and servants, 
eovemors and subjects, friends and 
friends, men and men : nor does it mere- 
ly enjoin the observation of equity, but 
likewise inspires the most sublime and 
extensive charity ; a boundless and dis- 
interested effusion of tenderness for the 
whole species, which feels their dis- 
tress, and operates for their relief and 
improvement." 

"Christianity," it has also been obser- 
ved (and with the greatest propriety,) 
** is superior to all other religions. The 
disciple of Jesus not only contends that 
no system of religion has ever yet been 
exhibited so consistent with itself, so 
congruous J:o philosophy and the com- 
mon sense of mankind, as Christianity : 
he likewise avers that it is infinitely 
more productive of real consolation than 
all other religious or philosophical te- 
nets which have ever entered into the 
soul, or been applied to the heart of 
man. For what is death to that mind 
•which considers eternity as the career 
of its existence ? Wliat are the frowns 
of men to him who claims an eternal 
world as his inheritance ? What is the 
loss of friends to that heart which feels, 
with more than natural conviction, that 
it shall quickly rejoin them in a more 
tender, intimate, and permanent inter- 
course, than any of which the present 
life is susceptible ? What are the vicis- 
situdes of external things to a mind 
which strongly and uniformly anticipates 
a state of endless and immutable felici- 
ty? What are mortifications, disap- 
pointments, and insults, to a spirit which 



is conscious of being the original off- 
spring and adopted child of God : which 
knows that its omnipotent Father will 
in proper time effectually assert the 
dignity and privileges of its nature ? In 
a word, as this earth is but a speck in 
the creation, as time is not an instant 
in proportion to eternity, such are the 
hopes and prospects of the Christian m 
comparison of eveiy sublunary misfor- 
tune or difficulty. It is therefore, in his 
judgment, the eternal wonder of angels, 
and indelible opprobrium of man, that 
a religion so worthy of God, so suitable 
to the frame and circumstances of our 
nature, so consonant to all the dictates 
of reason, so friendly to the dignity and 
improvement of intelligent beings, so 
pregnant with genuine comfort and de- 
light, should be rejected and despised 
by any of the human race." 

V. Christianity, /2ro/?a§-fl?ion and 
success of. Despised as Christianity has 
been by many, yet it has had an exten- 
sive progress through the world, and still 
remains to be professed by great num- 
bers of mankind ; though it is to be la- 
mented many are unacquainted with its 
genuine influence. It was early and 
rapidly propagated through the whole 
Roman empire, which then contained 
almost the whole known world : and 
herein we cannot but admire both the 
wisdom and the power of God. "Des- 
titute of all human advantages," says a 
good writer, "protected by no authority, 
assisted by no art ; not recommended 
by the reputation of its author, not en- 
forced by eloquence in its advocates, the 
word of God grew mightily and pre- 
■vailed. Twelve men, poor, artless, and 
illiterate, we behold triumphing over 
the fiercest and most determined oppo- 
sition ; over the tyranny of the ma- 
gistrate, and the subtleties of the philo- 
sopher ; over the prejudices of the Gen- 
tile, and the bigotry of the Jew. They 
established a rehgion which held forth 
high and venerable mysteries, such as 
the pride of man would induce him to 
suspect, because he could not perfectly 
comprehend them ; which preached 
doctrines pure and spiritual, such as 
corrupt nature was prone to oppose, be- 
cause it shrunk from the severity of their 
discipline ; which required its followers 
to renounce almost every opinion they 
had embraced as sacred, and every in- 
terest' they had pursued as important ; 
which even exposed them to every spe- 
cies of danger and infamy ; to perse- 
cution unmerited and unpitied; to the 
gloom of a prison, and to the pangs of 
death. Hopeless as this prospect might 
appear to the view of short-sighteid man,

the Gospel yet emerged from the obscu- 
rity in which it was likely to be over- 
whelmed by the complicated distresses 
of its friends, and the unrelenting cru- 
elty of its foes. It succeeded in a pe- 
culiar degree, and in a peculiar man- 
ner ; it derived that success from tmth, 
and obtained it under circumstances 
where falsehood must have been de- 
tected and crushed." 

"Although," says the elegant Porteus, 
"Christianity has not always been so 
well understood, or so honestly practi- 
sed, as it ought to have been ; although 
its spirit has been often mistaken, and 
its precepts misapplied, yet, under all 
these disadvantages, it has gradually 
produced a visible change in those points 
which most materially concern the peace 
and quiet of the world. Its beneficent 
spirit has spread itself through all the 
different relations and modifications of 
life, and communicated its kindly in- 
fluence to almost e\ery public and pri- 
vate concern of mankind. It has insensi- 
bly worked itself into the inmost frame 
and constitution of civil states. It has 
given a tinge to t!\e complexion of their 
governments, to the temper and admi- 
nistration of their laws. It has restrained 
the spirit of the prince and the madness 
of the people. It has softened the rigour 
of despotism, and tamed the insolence of 
conquest. It has in some degree taken 
away the edge of the sword, and thrown 
even over, the horrors of war a veil of 
mei'cy. It has descended into families, 
has diminished the pressure of private 
tyranny ; improved every domestic en- 
deannent ; given tenderness to the pa- 
rent, humanity to the master, respect 
to superiors, to inferiors ease ; so that 
mankind are, upon the whole, even in a 
temporal view, under infinite obligations 
to the mild and pacific temper of the 
Gospel, and have reaped from it more 
substantial worldly benefits than from 
any other institution upon earth. As one 
proof of this (among many others,) con- 
sider only the shocking carnage made 
in the human species by the exposure 
of infants, the gladiatorial shows, which 
sometimes cost Europe twenty or thirty 
thousand Ihes in a month ; and the ex- 
ceedingly cniel usage of slaves, allowed 
and practised by the ancient pagans. 
These were not the accidental and tem- 
porary excesses of a sudden fury, but 
were legal and established, and con- 
stant methods of murdering and tor- 
menting mankind. Had Christianity 
done nothing more than brought ijito 
disuse (as it confessedly has done) the 
two former of these human customs, 
entirely, and the latter to a very great 



degree, it had justly merited the title 
of the benevolent religion: but this is 
far from being all. 'Throughout the 
more enlightened parts of Christendom 
there prevails a gentleness of manners 
widely different from the ferocity of the 
most civilized nations of antiquity ; and 
that liberality with which every species 
of distress is relieved, is a virtue pecu- 
liar to, the Christian name." 

But we may ask farther, what success 
has it had on the mind of man, as it re- 
spects his eternal welfare ? How many- 
thousands have felt its power, rejoiced 
in its benign influence, and under its dic- 
tates been constrained to devote them- 
selves to the glory and praise of God ? 
Burdened with guilt, incapable of find- 
ino; relief from human resources, the 
mmd has here found peace imspeakable, 
in beholding that sacrifice which alone 
could atone for transgression. Here the 
hard and impenitent heart has been 
softened, the impetuous passions re- 
strained, the fei'ocious temper subduecj, 
powerful prejudices conquered, igno- 
rance dispelled, and the obstacles to real 
happiness removed. Here the Chris- 
tian, looking round on the glories and 
blandishments of this world, has been 
enabled with a noble contempt to de- 
spise all. Here death itself, the king of 
terrors, has lost its sting ; and the soul, 
with an holy magnanimity, has borne up 
in the agonies of a dying hour, and sweet- 
1)' sung itself away to everlasting bliss. 

In respect to its future spread, we 
have reason to believe that all nations 
shall feel its happy effects. The pro- 
phecies are pregnant with matter as to 
this belief. It seems that not only a na- 
tion or a country, but the whole habitable 
globe, shall become the kingdom of our 
Lord and of his Christ : and who is there 
that has ever known the excellency of 
this sj'stem ; who is there that has ever 
expei'ienced its happy efficacy ; who is 
there that has ever been convinced of 
its divine origin, its delightful nature, 
and peaceful tendency, but what must 
join the benevolent and royal poet in 
saying, "Let the whole earth be filled 
with its glory, amen, and amen."

CHRISTMAS, the day on which the 
nativity of oui* blessed Saviour is cele- 
brated. 

The first footsteps we find of the ob- 
servation of this day are in the second 
century, about the time of the Emperor 
Commodus. The decretal epistles, in- 
deed, carry it up a little higher, ajid say 
that Telesphoriis, who lived in the reitjn 
of Antoninus Pius, ordered divine ser- 
vice to be celebrated, and an angelic 
hymn to be sung the night before the 
nativity of our Saviour. That it was 
kept before the time of Constantine we 
have a melancholy proof; for whilst the 
persecution raged under Dioclesian, 
who then kept his court at Nicomedia, 
that t}a'ant, among other acts of cruelty, 
finding multitudes of Christians assem- 
bled together to celebrate Christ's na- 
tivity, commanded the church doors 
where they were met to be shut, and 
fire to be put to it, which scon reduced 
them and the church to ashes. Sec

CHRONOLOGY, the science of 
computing and adjusting the periods of 
time, referring each event to the proper 
year. We have not room here to pre- 
sent the reader with a system of chro- 
nology ; but should he be desirous of 
studying this science, he may consult 
the systems of Cliiviar, Calvisius, Ush- 
er, Sinison, Bedford, 3Ia7-shman, Blair, 
Plan fair, and Dr. Hales. 

CHURCH. 1. The Greek word 
Exx^TKTia denotes an assembly met about 
business, whether lawful or unlawful. 
Acts xix. 32, 39. — 2. It is understood 
of the collective body of Christians, or 
all those over the face of the earth who 
profess to believe in Christ, and ac- 
knowledge him to he the Saviour of 
mankind : this is called the visible 
church, Eph. iii. 21. 1 Tim. iii. 15. 
Eph. iv. 11, 12. — 3. By the word church, 
also, we are to understand the whole 
body of God's chosen people, in every 
period of time : this is the invisibie 
church. Those on earth are also called 
the militant, and those in heaven the 
triumphant church, Heb. xii. 23. Acts 
XX. 28. Eph. i. 22. Matt. xvi. 28. — 4. 
By a particular cluirch we understand 
an assembly of Christians united to- 
gether, and mcefing in one place for the 
solemn worship of God. To this agree 
the definition given by the compilers of 
the thirty-nine articles : — "A congrega- 
tion of faithful men, in which the true 
word of God is preached, and the sacra- 
ments duly administered according to 
Christ's ordinance's, in all those things 



that of necessity are requisite to the 
same," Acts ix. 31. Gal. i. 2, 22. 1 Cor. 
xiv. 34. Acts XX. 17. Col. iv. 15.— 5. 
The word is now used also to denote any 
particular denomination of Christians 
distinguished by particular doctrines, 
ceremonies, &amp;c. ; as the Romish church, 
Greek church, English church, &amp;c. 

Congregational church is so called 
from their maintaining that each con- 
gregation of Christians which meet in 
one place for religious worship is a com- 
plete church, and has sufficient power 
to act and perform every thing relative 
to religious government within itself, 
and is in no respect subject or ac- 
countable to any other church. It does 
not appear, say they, that the primitive 
churches were national ; they were not 
even provincial ; for, though there were 
many believers and protessing Chris- 
tians in Judea, in Galilee, in Samaria, in 
Macedonia, in Galatia, and other pro- 
vinces, yet we never read of a provin- 
cial church in any of those places. The 
particular societies of Christians in 
these districts are mentioned in the plu- 
ral number, 2 Cor. viii. 1. Gal. i. 2. Acts 
ix. 31. According to them, we find 
no mention made of diocesan churches 
in the New Testament. In the days of 
the apostles, bishops were so far from 
presiding over more churches than one, 
that sometimes a plurality of bishops 
presided over the same church. See 
Phil. i. 1. Nor do we find any mention 
made of parochial churches. Some of 
the inhabitants of a parish may l^e Infi- 
dels, Mahometans, or Jews; but Gos- 
pel churches consist of such as make an 
open profession of their faith in Christ, 
and subjection to the Gospel, Rom. i. 7. 
1 Cor. xiv. 33. It seems plain, then, that 
the primitive churches of Christ were 
properly congregational. The first 
church at Jerusalem met together in 
one place at the same time. Acts i. 14, 
15. The church of Antioch did the 
same. Acts xiv. 27. The church of 
Corinth the same, 1 Cor. xiv. 23. The 
same did the church at Troas, Acts xx. 
7. There was a church at Cenchrea, 
a port of Corinth, distinct from the 
church in that city, Rom. xvi. He that 
was a member of one church was not a 
member of another. The apostle Paul, 
writing to the Colossian society, says — 
" Epaphras, who is one of you, saluteth 
you," Col. iv. 12. 

Such a church is a body distinguished 
from the civil societies of the world by 
the spiritual nature and design of its 
govenuTient ; for, though Christ Avould 
have order .kept in his church, yet with- 
out any coercive force j a thing incon-

siiitent with the veiy nature of such a 
society, whose end is instiiiction ; and 
a practice suitable to it, which can 
never in the nature of things be accom- 
plished by penal laws or external coer- 
cion, Isa. xxxiii. 22. Matt, xxiii. 8, 10. 
John xviii. 36. Ps. ii. 6. 2 Cor. x. 4, 5. 
Zech. iv. 6, &amp;c. 

1. Church members are those who 
compose or belong to the church. As to 
the visible church, it may be observed 
that real saintship is not the distinguish- 
ing criterion of the members of it. None, 
indeed, can without it honestly offer 
themselves to church fellowship ; but 
they cannot be refused admission for the 
mere want of it ; for 1. God alone can 
judge the heart. Deceivers can counter- 
feit saintsliip, 1 Sam. xvi. 1, 7. — 2. God 
himself admitted many members of the 
Jewish church whose hearts were un- 
sanctified, Deut. xxix. 3, 4, 13. John vi. 
70. — 3. John the Baptist and the apostles 
required no more than outward afijiear- 
ances of faith and repentance in order 
to baptism, Matt. iii. 5, 7. Acts ii. 28. 
viii. 13, 23. — 4. Many that were admit- 
ted members in the churches of Judea, 
Corinth, Philippi, Laodicea, Sardis, &amp;c. 
were unregenerated, Acts v. 1, 10. viii. 
13, 23. 1 Cor. i. 11. v. 11. Phil. iii. 18, 
19. Rev. iii. 5, 15, 17. — 5. Christ com- 
pares the Gospel church to a floor on 
which com and chaff are mingled to- 
gether ; to a net in which good and bad 
are gathered, See. See Matt. xiii. 

As to the real church, 1. The tnie 
members of it are such as are born 
again. — 2. They come out from tl\e 
world, 1 Cor. vi. 17. — 3. They openly 

Krofess love to Christ, James ii. 14, 26. 
lark viii. 34, &amp;c. — 4. They walk in all 
the ordinances of the Lord blameless. 
None but such are proper members of 
the true church ; nor should any be ad- 
mitted to any Jiarticular church without 
some appearance of these, at least. 

2. Church fellowship is the commu- 
nion that the members enjoy one with 
another. 

The end of church fellowship is, 1. 
The maintenance and exhibition of a 
system of sound principles, 2 Tim. i. 13. 

1 Tim. vi. 3, 4. 1 Cor. viii. 5, 6. Heb. ii. 
1. Eph. iv. 21.— 2. The support of the 
ordijiances of Gospel worship in their 

Eurity and simplicity, Deut. xii. 31, 32. 
.om. XV. 6. — 3. The impartial exercise 
of church government and discipline, 
Heb. xii. 15. Gal. vi. 1. 2 Tim. ii. 24, 26. 
Tit. iii. 10. 1 Cor. v. James iii. 17. — 4. 
The promotion of holiness in all man- 
ner of conversation, Phil. i. 27. ii. 15, 16. 

2 Pet. iii. 11. Phil. iv. 8. 

The more particular duties are. 1. 



Earnest study to keep peace and unity, 
Eph. iv. 3. Phil. ii. 2, 3. Phil. iii. 15, 
16. — 2. Bearing of one another's bur- 
thens. Gal. vi. 1, 2. — 3. Earnest endea- 
vours to prevent each other's stumbling, 

1 Cor. x. 2, 3. Heb. x. 24, 27. Rom. xiv. 
13. — 4. Stedfast continuance in the 
faith and worship of the Gospel, Acts 
ii. 42. — 5. Praying for and sympathizing 
with each other, 1 Sam. xii. 23. Eph. 
vi. 18. 

The advantages are, 1. Peculiar in- 
citements to holiness, Eccl. iv. 11. — . 
2. There are some promises applicable 
to none but those wlio attend the ordi- 
nances of God, and hold communion 
with the saints, Ps. xcii. 13. Isa. xxv. 6. 
Ps. cxxxii. 13, 16. Ps. xxzvi. 8. Jer. 
xxxi. 12. — 3. Such are under the watch- 
ful eye and care of their pastor, Heb. 
xiii. 7. — 4'. Su1)ject to the fi-iendly re- 
proof or kind advice of the saints, 1 Cor. 
xii. 25. — 5. Their zeal and love are ani- 
mated by reciprocal conversation, Mai. 
iii. 16. Prov. xxvii. 17. — 6. They may 
restore each other if they fall, Eccl. iv. 

10. Gal. vi. 1. — 7. More easily promote 
the cause, and spread the Gospel else- 
where. 

3. Church ordinances are, 1. Reading 
of the Scriptures, Neh. ix. 3. Acts xvii. 

11. Neh. viii. 3, 4. Luke iv. 16;— 2. 
Preaching and expounding, 1 Tim. iii. 2. 

2 Tim. ii. 24. Eph. iv. 8. Rom. x. 15. 
Heb. v. 4. — 3. Hearing, Is. Iv. 1. James 
i. 21. 1 Pet. ii. 2. 1 Tim. iv. 13.-4. 
Praver, Ps. v. 1, 2. Ps. xcv. 6. Ps. cxxi. 
1. Ps. xxviii. 2. Acts xii. 12. i. 14.-5. 
Singing of psalms, Ps. xlvii. 1 to 6. Col. 
iii. 16. 1 Cor. xiv. 15. Eph. v. 19.-6. 
Thanksgiving, Ps. 1. 14. Ps. c. James v. 
13. — 7. The Lord's supper, 1 Cor. xi. 
23, 8cc. Acts XX. 7. 

Baptism is not properly a church or- 
dinance, since it ought to be adminis- 
tered before a person be admitted into 
church fellowship. See Baptism. 

4. Church officers are those appointed 
by Christ for preaching the word, and 
the superintendence of church affairs : 
such are bishops and deacons, to which 
some add, elders. See these articles. 

5. As to church order and discipline, 
it may be observed, that every Christian 
society formed on the congregational 
plan is strictly independent of all other 
religious societies. No other church, 
however numerous or respectable ; no 
person or persons, however eminent for 
authority, abilities, or influence, have 
any right to assume arbitrary jurisdic- 
tion over such a society. They have 
but one master, who is Christ. See Matt, 
xviii. 15, 19. Even the ofl[icers which 
Christ has appointed in his church have 



CHU

CHU 



no pow'er to give new laws to it; but 
only, in conjunction with the other mem- 
bers of the society, to execute the com- 
mands of Christ. The}' have no do- 
minion over any man's' faith, nor any 
compulsive power over the consciences 
of any. Every particular church has a 
riglit to judge of the fitness of those 
who offer themselves as members. Acts 
jx. 26. If they are found to be proper 
pei'sons, they must then be admitted ; 
and this should always be followed with 
prayer, and with a solemn exhortation 
to the persons received. If any mem- 
ber walk disorderly, and continue to do 
so, the church is empowered to exclude 
him, 1 Cor. v. 7. 2 Thess. iii. 6. Rom. 
xvi. 17. which should be done with the 
greatest tenderness; but if evident signs 
of repentance should be discovered, 
such must be received again. Gal. vi. 1. 
This and other church business is gene- 
rally done on some day preceding the 
sabbath on which the ordinance is ad- 
ministered.

CHURCH OF ENGLAND, is the 
church established by law in this king- 
dom. 

When and by whom Christianity was 
first introduced into Britain cannot per- 
haps be exactly ascertained. Eusebius, 
indeed, positively declares that it was 
by the apostles and their disciples. It is 
also said that numbers of persons pro- 
fessed the Christian faith here about the 
year 150 ; and according to Usher, there 
was in the year 182 a school of learn- 
ing, to provide the British churches 
with proper teacliers. Popery, how- 
ever, was established in England by 
Austin the monk ; and the errors of it 
we find every where prevalent, until 
WickliflPe was raised up by Divine Pro- 
vidence to refute them. The church of 
England remained in subjection to the 
pope until the time of Heniy VIII. 
Henry, indeed, in early life, and during 
the former part of his reign, was a 
bigotted papist: he burnt the famous 
Tyndal (who made one of the first and 
best translations of the New Testa- 
ment;) and wrote in defence of the 
seven sacraments against Luther, for 
which the pope gave him the title of 



"The Defender of the Faith." But, 
falling out with the pope about his mar- 
riage, he took the government of eccle- 
siastical affairs into his own hand ; and, 
having reformed many abuses, entitled 
himself supreme head of the church. 
See Reformation. 

The doctrines of the church of Eng- 
land, which are contained in the thirty- 
nine articles, are certainly Calvinistical, 
j though this has been denied by some 
modem writers, especially by Dr. Kip- 
ling, in a tract entitled, " The Articles 
of the Church of England proved not 
to be Calvinistic." These articles were 
founded, for the most part, upon a body 
of articles compiled and published in 
the reign of Edward VI. They were 
first passed in the convocation, and con- 
firmed by royal authority in 1562. They 
were . afterwards ratified anew in the 
year 1571, and again by Charles I. The 
law requires a subscription to these ar- 
ticles of all persons who are admitted 
into holy orders. In the course of the 
last century disputes arose among the 
clergy respecting the propriety of sub- 
scribing to any human formulary of re- 
ligious sentiments. An application for 
its removal was made to parliament, in 
1772, by the petitioning clergy ; and 
received the most public discussion in 
the house of commons, but was rejected 
in the house of lords. 

The govermnent of the church of 
England is episcopal. The king is the 
supreme head. There are two arch- 
bishops, and twenty-four bishops. The 
benefices of the bishops were converted 
by William the Conqueror into tempo- 
ral baronies ; so that every prelate has 
a seat and a vote in the house of peers. 
Di*. Hoadley, however, in a sermon 
preached from this text — "My king- 
dom is not of this world," insisted that 
the clergy had no pretensions to tempo- 
ral jurisdiction ; which gave rise to va- 
rious publications, termed by way of 
eminence, the Bangorian Controversy, 
because Hoadley was then bishop of 
Bangor. Dr. Wake, archbishop of Can- 
terbury, formed a project of peace and 
union between the English and Gallican 
churches, founded upon this condition, 
that each of the two communities should 
retain the greatest part of their respec- 
tive and peculiar doctrines ; but this 
project came to nothing. In the church 
of England there are deans, archdea- 
cons, rectors, vicars. Sec. ; for an account 
of which, see the respective articles 

The church of England has a public 
form read, called a Liturgy. It was 
composed in 1547, and has undergone 
several alterations, the last of which

was in 1661. Since that time, several 
attempts have been made to amend the 
liturgy, articles, and some other things 
relating to the internal govei-nment, but 
without effect. There are many excel- 
lencies in the liturgy ; and, in the opinion 
of the most impartial Grotius (who was 
no member of this church,) " it comes 
so near the primitive pattern, that none 
of the reformed churches can compare 
with it." See Liturgy. 

The gi-eatest part of the inhabitants 
of England are professedly members of 
this church ; but, perhaps, very few 
either of her ministers or members 
strictly adhere to the articles in their 
true sense. Those who are called me- 
thodistic or evangelical preachers in the 
establishment are allowed to come the 
nearest.

CHURCHGALLICAN, denotes the 
ci-devant church of France under the 
government of its respective bishops and 
pastors. This church always enjoyed 
certain franchises and immunities, not 
as grants from popes, but as derived to 
her from her first original, and which 
she took care never to relinquish. These 
liberties depended iipon two maxims; 
the first, that the pope had no right to 
order any thing in which the temporali- 
ties and civil rights of the kingdom were 
concerned ; the second, that, notwith- 
standing the pope's supremacy Avas ad- 
mitted m cases purely spiritual, yet in 
France his power was limited by the 
decrees of ancient councils received in 
that realm. 

In the established church the Jansen- 
ists were veiy numerous. The bishop- 
rics and prebends were entirely in the 
gift of the king ; and no other "catholic 
state, except Italy, had so numerous a 
clergy as France. There were in this 
kingdom eighteen archbishops, one hun- 
dred and eleven bishops, one hundred 
and sixty-six thousand clergymen, and 
three thousand four hundred convents, 
containing two thousand persons devo- 
ted to a monastic life. 

Since the repeal of the edict of Nantz, 



the protestants have suffered much fromi 
persecution. A solemn law, which did 
much honour to Louis XVI. late king 
of France, gave to his non-Roman Ca- 
tholic subjects, as they were called, all 
the civil advantages and pri\ilcges of 
their Roman Catholic brethren. 

The above statement was made pre- 
viously to the French revolution : great 
alterations have taken place since that 
period. And it may be interesting to 
those who have not the means of fuller 
information, to give a sketch of the 
causes which gave rise to those impor- 
tant events- 
It has been asserted, that about the 
middle of the last century a conspiracy 
w^as formed to OA'crthrow Christianity, 
without distinction of worsliip, whether 
Protestant or Catholic. Voltaire, D'- 
Alembert, Frederick II. king of Prus- 
sia, and Diderot, were at the head of 
this conspiracy. Numerous other adepts 
and secondary agents were induced to 
join them. These pretended philoso- 
phers used every artifice that impiety 
could invent, by union and secret cor- 
respondence, to attack, to debase, and 
annihilate Christianity. They not only 
acted in concert, sparing no political or 
impious art co effect the destiniction of 
the Christian religion, but they were 
the instigators and conductors o'f those 
secondary agents, whom they had se- 
duced, and pursued tlieir plan with all 
the ardour and constancy which de- 
notes the most finished conspirators. 

The French clergy amounted to one 
hundred and thirty thousand, the higher 
orders of whom enjoyed immense re- 
venues ; but the cures, or great body of 
acting clergy, seldom possessed rnore 
than twenty-eight pounds sterling a 
year, and the vicars about half the sum 
The clergy as a body, independent of 
their titles, possessed a revenue ai'ising 
from their property in land, amounting 
to five millions sterling annually ; at the 
same time they were exempt from tax- 
ation. Before t]ie levelling system had 
taken place, the clergy signified to the 
commons the instructions of their con- 
stituents, to contribute to the exigencies 
of the state in equal proportion with, 
the other citizens. Not contented with 
this offer, the tithes and revenues of the 
clergy were taken away; in lieu of 
which, it was proposed to grant a cer-^ 
tain stipend to the different ministers 
of religion, to be payable bv the nation. 
The possessions ot the church were 
then considered as national property by 
a decree of the constituent assembly. 
The religious orders, viz. the commu- 
nities of monks and nuns, possessed 
N 



CHU 



98 



immense landed estates; and, after 
having abolished tl\e orders, the assem- 
bly seized the estates for the use of tlie 
nation : the gates of tlie cloisters were 
now thrown open. The next step of 
the assembly was to establish what is 
called the civil consliiution of the clergy. 
This, the Roman (Catholics assert, was 
in direct opposition to their religion. 
But though opposed with energetic elo- 
fjuence, the decree passed, and Avas soon 
after followed by another, obliging the 
clergy to swear to maintain their civil 
constitution. Every artifice which cun- 
ning, and every menace which cruelty 
could invent, were used to induce them 
to take the oath ; great numbers, how- 
ever, refused. One hundred and thirty- 
eight bishops and arch-bishops, sixty- 
eight curates or vicars, v/ere on this 
account driven from their sees and pa- 
rishes. Three hundred of the priests 
were massacred in one day in one city. 
All the other pastors who adhered to 
their religion were either sacrificed, or 
banished from their country, seeking 
through a thousand dangers a refuge 
among foreign nations. A peiiisal of tlie 
horrid massacres of the priests who re- 
fused to take the oaths, and the various 
forms of persecution employed by those 
who were attached to the Catholic re- 
ligion, niust deeply wound the feelings 
of humanity. Those readers who are 
desirous of farther information, are re- 
fen*ed to Abbe Barrul's History of the 
Clergy. 

Some think that there was another 
cause of the revolution, and which may 
be traced as far back at least as the 
revocation of the edict of Nantz in the 
seventeenth century, when the gi'eat 
body of French Protestants who were 
men of principle, were either murdered 
or banished, and the rest in a manner 
silenced. The effect of this sanguinary 
measure (say they) must needs be the 
general prevalence of infidelity. Let 
the religious part of any nation be ba- 
nished, and a general spread of irreli- 
gion must necessarily follow : such were 
the effects in France. Through the 
whole of the eighteenth century infide- 
lity has been the fashion, and that not 
only among the princes and noblesse, 
but even among the greater part of the 
bishops and clergy. And as they had 
united their iniluence in banishing true 
i-eligion, and cherishing the monster 
which succeeded it, so have they been 
united in sustaining the calamitous ef- 
fects which that monster has produced. 
However unprincipled and cruel the 
French revolutionists have been, and 
howerver much the sufferers, as fellow- 



CHU 

creatures, are entitled to our pity ; yet, 
considering the event as the just retri- 
bution of God, we are constrained to 
say, " Thou art righteous, O liOrd, who 
art, and wast, and shalt be, because 
thou hast judged thus; for they have 
shed tlie blood of saints and pi-ophets, 
and thou hast given them blood to 
drink ; for they are worthy." 

The Catholic religion is now again 
established, but with a toleration of the 
Protestants, under some restriction. —

levy a shilling forfeiture on all such as 
do not go to church on Sundays, and to

CHURCH- YARD, a piece of ground 
adjoining to the church, set apart for 
the interment of the dead. In the church 
of Rome, church-yards are consecrated 
with great solemnity. If a church-yard 
which has been thus consecrated shall 
afterwards be polluted by any indecent 
action, or profaned by the burial of an 
infidel, an heretic, an excommunicated 
or unbaptized person, it must be recon- 
ciled ; and the ceremony of the recon- 
ciliation is performed with the same 
solemnity as that of the consecration ! 
See Consecration. 

CIRCONCELLIONES, a species of 
fanatics ; so called because they were 
continually rambling round the houses 
in the country. They took their rise 
among the Donatists, in the reign of 
the emperor Constantine. It is mcre- 
dible what ravages and cruelties they 
committed in Africa, through a long 
series of years. They were illiterate 
savage peasants, who understood only 
the Punic language. Intoxicated with 
a barbarous zeal, they renounced agri- 
culture, professed continence, and as- 
sumed the title of " Vindicators of jus- 
tice, and protectors of the oppressed." 
To accomplish their mission, they en- 
franchized slaves, scoured the roads, 
forced masters to alight from their cha- 
riots, and run before their slaves, whom 
they obliged to mount in their place ; 
and discharged debtors, killing the cre- 
ditors if they refused to cancel their 
bonds. But the chief objects of their 
cnielty were the Catholics, and espe- 
cially those who had renounced Dona- 
tism. At first they used no swords, 
because God had forbidden the use of 
one to Peter: but they were armed 
with clubs, which they called the clubs 
of Israel, and which they handled in such 
a manner as to break a man's bones 
without killing him immediately, so that 
he languished a long time, and then 
died. When they took away a man's 
life at once, they looked upon it as a 
favour. They became less scrupulous 
afterwards, and made use of all sorts 
of arms. Their shout was Praise be to 



God. These words in their months 
were the signal of slaughter more ter- 
rible than the roaring of a lion. They 
had invented an unheai-d-of punishment, 
which was to cover with lime, diluted 
with vinegar, the eyes of those unhappy 
wretches whom they had crushed with 
blows and covered with wounds, and 
to abandon them in that condition. 
Never was a stronger proof what hor- 
rors superstition can beget in minds 
destitute of knowledge and humanity. 
These brutes, who had made a vow of 
chastity, gave themselves up to wine, 
and all sorts of impurities; running 
about with women and young girls as 
drunk as themselves, whom they called 
sacred x'irgi?7s, and who often canned 
proof of their incontinence. Their 
chief took the name of chief of the 
saints. After having glutted themselves 
with blood, they turned their rage upon 
themselves, and sought death with the 
same fury with which they gave it to 
others. Some scrambled up to the tops 
of rocks, and cast themselves down 
headlong in multitudes ; others burned 
themselve's, or threw themselves into 
the sea. Those who proposed to ac- 
quire the title of martyrs, published it 
long before; upon which they were 
feasted and fattened like oxen for the 
slaughter; after these preparations they 
set out to be destroyed. Sometimes 
they gave money to those whom they 
met, and threatened to murder them if 
they did not make them martyrs. Theo- 
doret gives an account of a stout young 
man, who meeting with a troop of^ these 
fanatics, consented to kill them, pro- 
vided he might bind them first; and 
having by this means put it out of their 
power to defend themselves, whipped 
them as long as he was able, and then 
left them tied in that manner. Their 
bishops pretended to blame them, but 
in reality made use of them to intimi- 
date such as might be tempted to for- 
sake their sect; they even honoured 
them as saints. They were not, how- 
ever, able to govern those furious mon- 
I sters ; and more than once found them- 
j selves under a necessity of abandoning 
I them, and even of imploring the assist- 
I ance of the secular power against them. 
The counts Ursacius and Taurinus were 
I employed to quell them ; they destroy- 
I ed a great number of tliem, of whom 
the Donatists made as many martyrs. 
I Ursacius, who was a Catholic, and a 
religious man, having lost his life in an 
engagement with the barbarians, the 
Donatists did not fail to tr'.mph in his 
death, as an effect of the vengeance of 
heaven. Africa was the theatre of the-se

bloody scenes during a great part of 
Constantine's life. 

CISTERCIANS, a religious order 
fouiided by St. Robeit, a Benedictine, 
in the eleventh century. They became 
so powerful, that they governed almost 
all Europe both in spirituals and tem- 
porals. Cardinal de Vetri, describing 
their observances, says, they neither 
•wore skintinor shirts, nor ever ate flesh, 
except in sickness ; and abstained from 
fish, eggs, milk and cheese : they lay 
upon straw beds in tunics and cowls ; 
they rose at midnight to prayers ; they 
spent the day in labour, reading, and 
prayers ; and in all their exercises ob- 
served a continual silence, 

CLEMENCY denotes much the 
same as mercy. It is most generally 
used in speaking of the forgiveness ex- 
ercised by princes. It is the result, in- 
deed, of a disposition which ought to 
be cultivated Ijy all ranks, though its 
effects cannot be equally conspicuous. 

Clcviency is not only the privilege, 
the honour, and the duty of a prince, 
but it is also his security, and better 
than all his garrisons, forts, and guards, 
to preserve himself and his dominions 
in safety. That prince is truly royal 
•who masters himself, looks upon all in- 
iuries as l^elow him, and governs by 
equity and reason, not by passion- or 
caprice. Da^id, king of Israel, appears 
in no instance greater or more amiable 
than hi sparing the life of his persecu- 
tor Saul, whan it was in his power. 

CLERGY (from the Greek word 
yXxfi^ai, heritage,^ .i the general sense 
of the word, as used by us, signifies the 
body of ecclesiastics of the Christian 
church, in contradistinction to the laity : 
but strictly speaking, and according to 
Scripture, it means the church. — 
*' When Joshua," as one observes, " di- 
vided the Holy Land by lot among the 
Israelites, it pleased God to provide for 
a thirteenth part of them, called Le- 
vites, by assigning them a personal 
estate equivalent to that provision made 
by real estate, which was allotted to 
each of the other twelve parts. In con- 
formity to tlie style of the transaction, 
the Levites were called God's lot, in- 
heritance, or clergy. This style, how- 
ever, is not always used by the Old 
Testament writers. Sometimes they call 
all the nations God's lot, Deut. xxxii. 9. 
Ps. Ixxviii. 71. Ps. xxviii. 9, &amp;c. The 
New Testament v/riters pdopt this term, 
and apply it to the whole Christian 
church, 1 Pet. v. 3. Thus it is the 
church distinguished from the world, 
and not one pai't of the church as dis- 
tinguished froni another part." The 



word clergy, however, among us, al- 
ways refers to ecclesiastics. 

The clergy originally consisted of 
bishops, priests, and deacons; but in 
the third centuiy many inferior orders 
were appointed ; such as sub-deacons, 
acoluthists, readers, 8cc. The clergy of 
the church of Rome are divided into 
regular and secular. The regular con- 
sists of those monks or religious who 
have taken upon them holy orders of 
the priesthood in their respective mo- 
nasteries. The secular clergy are those 
who are not of any religious order, and 
have the care and direction of parishes. 
The Protestant clergy are all secular. 
For archbishops, bishops, deans, Sec. &amp;c. 
see tliose aiticles. 

The clergy have large privileges al- 
lowed them by our municipal laws, and 
had formerly much greater, which were 
abridged at the reformation, on account 
of the ill use which the popish clergy 
had endeavoured to make of them ; for 
the laws having exempted them from 
almost every personal duty, they at- 
tempted a total exemption from every 
secular tie. The personal exemptions, 
indeed, for the most part, continue. A 
clergyman cannot be compelled to serve 
on a jury, nor to appear at a court leet, 
which almost every other person is 
obliged to do ; but if a layman be sum- 
moned on a jury, and before the trial 
takes orders, he shall notwithstanding 
appear, and be sworn. Neitlier can he 
be chosen to any temporal office ; as 
bailiff, reeve, constable, or the like, in 
regard to his own continual attendance 
on the sacred function. During his at- 
tendance on divine service, he is privi- 
leged from arrests in ci\'il suits. In 
cases of felony also, a clerk in orders 
shall have the benefit of clergy, without 
being branded in the hand, and may 
likewise have it more than once ; in both 
which cases he is distinguished from a 
layman. 

Benefit of Clergy was a privilege 
whereby a clergyman claimed to be 
delivered to his ordinary to purge him- 
self of felony, and which anciently was 
allowed 07ily to those who were in or- 
ders ; but, by the statute of 18th Eliz., 
eveiy man to whom the benefit of cler- 
gy is granted, though not in orders, is 
put to read at the bar, after he is found 
guilty, and convicted of felony, and so 
burnt in the hand; and set free for 
the first time, if the ordinary or deputy 
standing by do say, Legit ut clericus : 
otherwise he shall suffer death. As 
the clergy have their privileges, so they 
have also their disabilities, on account 
of their spiritual avocations. Cler-

g\Tnen are incapable of sitting in the 
house of commons ; and by statute 21 
Henry V^III. c. 13, are not in general 
allowed to take any lands or tenements 
to farm, upon pain of 10/. per month, 
and total avoidance of the lease ; nor 
upon like pain to keep any tap-house or 
brewhouse ; nor engage in any trade, 
nor sell any merchandise, under foi-- 
feiture of the treble value ; which pro- 
hibition is consonant to the canon law. 

The number of clergy in England 
and Wales amount, according to the 
best calculation, to 18,000. The reve- 
nues of the clergy were formerly con- 
siderable, but since the reformation 
they are comparatively small, at least 
those of the niferior clcrg}'. See the 
Jiisho/i of Landaff^s Valuation of the 
Church and Univemity Revenues ; or, 
Cove on the Revenues of the Church, 
1797, 2d edition ; Burnett's Hist, of his 
own Times, conclusion. See article Mi- 
nister. 

CLERK: 1. A word originally used 
to denote a learned man, or man of 
letters; but now is the common appel- 
lation by which clergymen distinguish 
themselves in signing any deed or in- 
strument. — 2. Also the person who reads 
the responses of the congregation in the 
church, or gives out the hymns at a 
meeting. 

COCCEIANS, a denomination which 
arose in the seventeenth century ; so 
called from John Cocceius, professor of 
divinity in the University of Leyden. 
He represented the whole history of the 
Old Testament as a mirror, which held 
forth an accurate view of the transac- 
tions and events that were to happen in 
the church under the dispensation of 
the New Testament, and vmto the end 
of the world. He maintained that by 
far the gi-eatest pait of the ancient pro- 
phecies foretold Christ's ministry and 
mediation, and the rise, progress, and 
revolutions of the church, not only 
under the figure of persons and trans- 
actions, but m a literal manner, and by 
the very sense of the words used in 
these predictions ; and laid it down as a 
fundamental rule of intei-pretation, that 
the words and phrases of Scripture are 
to be understood in every sense of which 
they are susceptible, or, in other words, 
that they signify in effect every thing 
that they can possibly signify. 

Cocceius also taught, that the cove- 
nant made between God and the Jewish 
nation, by the ministry of Moses, was of 
the same nature as the new covenant, 
obtained by the mediation of Jesus 
(.'hrist. In consecjuence of this general 
principle, he maintained that the ten 



commandments were promulgated by 
Moses, not as a rule of obedience, but 
as a representation of the covenant of 
grace — that when the Jews had pro- 
voked the Deity by their \arious trans- 
gressions, particularl}' by the worship 
of the golden calf, the severe and ser- 
vile yoke of the ceremonial law was 
added to the decalogue, as a punishment 
inflicted on them by the Supreme Being 
in his righteous displeasure — that this 
yoke, which was painful in itself, be- 
came doubly so on account of its typical 
signification ; since it admonished the 
Israelites from day to day of the imper- 
fection and uncertainty of their state, 
filled them with anxiety, and was a 
perpetual proof that they had merited 
the righteous displeasure of God, and 
could not expect before the coming of 
the Messiah the entire remission of their 
iniquities — that indeed good men, even 
under the Mosaic dispensation, were 
immediately after death made parta- 
kers of everlasting glory ; but that they 
were nevertheless, during the whole 
course of their lives, far removed from 
that firm hope and assurance of salva- 
tion, which rejoices the faithful under 
the dispensation of the Gospel — and 
that their anxiety flowed naturally from 
this consideration, that tlieir sins, though 
they remained unpiuiished, were not 
pardoned ; because Christ had not as 
yet offered himself up a sacrifice to the 
Father, to make an entire atonement 
for them. 

CCENOBITE, one who lives in a 
convent, or in community, under a cer- 
tain male ; in opposition to a hermit, who 
lives in solitude. Cassian makes this 
difference between a convent and a mo- 
nastery, that the latter may be applied 
to the residence of a single religious or 
recluse ; whereas the convent implies 
coenobites, or numbers of religious living 
in common. Fleury speaks of three 
kinds of monks in Egypt ; anachorets, 
who live in solitude; ccenobites, who 
continue to live in community ; and sa- 
rabaites, vv^ho are a kind of monks- 
eiTant, that stroll from place to place.. 
He refers the institution of coenobites 
to the time of the apostles, and makes 
it a kind of imitation of the oi-dinary 
lives of the faithful at Jerusalem ; 
though St. Pachomius is ordinarily own- 
ed to be the institutor of the coenobite 
life, as being the first who gav e a rule 
to anv community.

the mass of the Romanists, it denotes a 
prayer accommodated to any particular 
I day, occasion, or the like. In general.

all the prayers in each office are called 
collects, either because the priest speaks 
in the name of the whwe assembly, 
whose sentiments and desires he sums 
up by the word "Oremus." "Let us 
pray," or because those prayers are of- 
fered when the people are assembled 
together. The popes Gelasius and Gre- 
gory are said to have been the first who 
established collects. Dr. Despence, of 
Paris, wrote a treatise on collects, their 
origin, antiqiiity, &amp;c. 

COLLEGIANS, or Collegiants, 
a sect formed among the Arminians and 
Anabaptists in Holland, about the be- 
ginning of the seventeenth century ; so 
called because of their colleges or 
meetings twice every week, where 
eveiy one, females excepted, has the 
same liberty of expounding the Scrip- 
ture, praying. See. They are said to be 
all either Arians or Socinians: they 
never communicate in the college, but 
meet twice a year, from all parts of 
Holland, at Rhinsberg (whence they 
are also called Rhinsberghers,') a village 
two miles from Leyden, where they 
communicate together; admitting every 
one that presents himself, professing 
his faith in the divinity of the Holy 
Scriptures, and resolution to live suita- 
bly to their precepts and doctrines, 
without regard to his sect or opinion. 
They have no particular ministers, but 
each officiates as he is disposed. They 
baptize bv immersion. 

COMMENTARY, an exposition, 
book of annotations or remarks. There 
are some people so wise in their own 
conceit, and think human helps of so 
little worth, that they despise commen- 
taries on the Scriptures altogether ; but 
every student or preacher whose busi- 
ness is to explain the sacred oracles, to 
make known the mind of God to others, 
to settle cases of conscience, to oppose 
the sophistry of sceptics, and to con- 
found the arguments of infidels, would 
do well to avail himself of the most 
judicious, clear, copious, critical, and 
sound commentaries on the Bible. Nor 
can I suppose that commentaries can 
be useless to the common people, for 
though a spirit of serious enquirv, with 
a little good sense, will go a great way 
in understariding the Bible, yet as the 
language is often figurative, as allusions 
are made to ancient customs, and some 
parts require more investigation than 
many common Christians have time 
for, a plain exposition certain! v must be 
useful. Expositions of the Bible, how- 
ever, may be made a bad use of. He 
who takes the ifise dixit of a commen- 
tator, without ever examming whether 



the meaning given comport with the 
text ? he who gives himsell no trouble 
to investigate the Scripture for himself, 
but takes occasion to be indolent, be- 
cause others have laboured for him, 
surely does wrong. Nor can it be sai(l 
that those preachers use them properly, 
who, in making their sermons, form 
their plans from the commentator be- 
fore they have thought upon the text. 
Perhaps the best way is to follow our 
o^vn talents ; first, by prayer, study, and 
attention to form our scheme, and then 
to examine the opinions of others con- 
cerning it. We will here present the 
reader with a view of some of those 
commentaries which are the most ge- 
nerally approved. And, 1st. in m„y 
opinion, rfenry takes the lead for com- 
mon utilit3^ The sprightly notes, the 
just inferences, the original thoughts, 
and the warm applications to the con- 
science, makes this work justly admired. 
It is true that there are some expres- 
sions which do not agree with the evan- 
gelic system ; but, as the late Mr. Ry- 
land observes, " 'Tis impossible for a 
person of piety and taste to read him 
without wishing to be shut out from all 
the world to read him through without 
one moment's interrufition" Mr. Heniy 
did not live to complete this work. He

great masters of solid sense, elegant 
expression, just and lively painting, and 
masculine eloquence, to the neglect of

vate, dissolute, and puerile manner of

sign so many of its productions to speedy 
oblivion. See also books recommendecl

COMMINATION, an office in the 
church of England «.ppointed to be read 
on Ash Wednesday. It is substituted in 
the I'oom of that godly discifiline in the 
primitive church, by which (as the in- 
troduction to the office expresses it) 
" such persons as stood convicted of 
notorious sins were put to open penance, 
and punished in this world, that theiv 
souls might be saved in the day of the 
Lord ; and that others, admonished by 
their example, might be the more 
afraid to offend." This discipline, in af- 
ter ages, degenerated in the church of 
Rome into a foiTnal confession of sins 
upon Ash Wednesday, and the empty 
ceremony of sprinkling ashes upon the 
head of the per.ole. Our reformers 
wisely rejected this ceremonv as mere 
shadow and show ; and substituted this 
office in its room, which is A denu7icia~ 
tion of God's anger and judgment 
against sinners ; that the people, being 
apprised of God's wrath and indignation 
against their sins, might not, through 
want of discipline to the church, be en- 
couraged to pursue them. 

COMMISSARY, an" officer of the 
bishop, who exercises spiritual juris- 
diction in places of a diocese so far from 
the episcopal see, that the chancellor 
cannot call the people to the bishop's 
principal consistory court without great 
inconvenience. 

COMMUNICATING, a term made 
use of to denote the act of receiving the 
Lord's supper. Those of the reformed 
and of the Greek church communicate 
under both kinds ; those of the Romish 
only under one. The oriental commu- 
nicants receive the species of wine by a 
spoon ; and anciently they sucked it 
through a pipe, as has been observed 
by Beat Rheanus on Tertullian. 

COMMUNION, in its strict and pro-

jper sense signifies holding something in 
common with another, Acts ii. 42. — 
2. In a more general sense, it denotes 
conformity or agreement, 2 Cor. vi. 14. 
Eph. V. 11. — 3. It signii'.es con-verse, or 
friendly intercourse, wherein men con- 
trive or consult together about matters 
of common concern, Luke vi. 11. Ps. 
iv. 4. — 4. Communion is also used for 
the Lord's supper, because we herein 
make a public profession of our con- 
formity to Christ and his laws ; and of 
our agreement with other Christians hi 
the spirit and faith of the Gospel. See 
Lord's Supper. 

The fourth council of Lateran de- 
crees, that every believer shall receive 
the communion, at least, at Easter ; 
which seems to import a tacit desire 
that they should do it oftener, as in 
effect they did it much oftener in the 
primitive days. Gratian and the master 
of the sentences, prescribe it as a rule 
for the laity to coniiiiunicatc three times 
a year; at Easter, Whitsuntide, and 
Christmas: but in the thirteenth centu- 
ry the practice prevailed of never ap- 
jjroacliHig the eucharist at Easter ; and 
the council thought fit to enjoin it then 
by a lav.-, lest their coldness and remiss- 
ness should go farther still : and the 
council of Trent renewed the same in- 
junction, and recommended frequent 
communion v/ithout enforcing it by an 
express decree. In the ninth century 
the communion was still received by 
the laity in both kinds, or rather the 
species of bread was dmped in the wine, 
as is owned by the Romanists them- 
selves. M. de Marca observes, that 
they received it at first in their hands ; 
and believes the communion under one 
kind alone to have had its rise in the 
West, under pope Urban II. in 1096, at 
the time of the conquest of the Holy 
Land. It was more solemnly enjoined 
b\r the council of Constance, hi 1414. 
The twenty-eighth canon of the coun- 
cil of Clermont enjoins the communion 
to be received under both kinds dis- 
tinctly ; adding, however, two excep- 
tions, — the one of necessity, the other 
of caution ; the first in favour of the 
sick, and the second of the abstemious, 
or those who had an aversion for wine. 
It was formerly a kind of canonical pu- 
nishment for clerks guilty of any crime 
to be reduced to lay com.munion ; i. e. 
only to recei\'-e it as the laity did, viz. 
vmder one kind. They had another 
punishment of the same nature, though 
imder a different name, called foreign 
communion, to which the canons fre- 
quently condemned their bishops and 
other clerks. This punishment was not 



any excommunication or deposition, but 
a kind of suspension from the function 
of the order, and a degradation from 
the rank they held in the church. It 
had its name because the communion 
was only granted to the criminal on the 
foot of a foreign clerk ; i. e. being 
reduced to the lowest of his order, he 
took his place after all those of his 
rank, as all clerks, &amp;c. did in the 
churches to which they did not belong. 
The second council of Agda orders 
every clerk that absents himself from 
the church to be reduced to foreign 
communion. 

Church communion is fellowship with 
any particular church. See Church 
Fkllowship. It is sometimes applied 
to different churches united in doctrine 
and discii^line. The three grand com- 
munions into which the Christian church 
ir, divided is that of the church of Rome, 
the Greek church, and the Protestant 
church ; liut originally all Christians 
were in communion with each other, 
having one communion, faith, and dis- 
cipline. 

Free Communion, a term made use 
of in relation to the Lord's supper, by 
which it is understood that all those 
who have Ijeen baptized, whether in 
infancy or adult age, may, on profession 
of their faith, sit down at the Lord's 
table with others of different denomina- 
tions. Some of the Baptists object to 
tree or mixed communion, and do not 
allow of persons wiio have been bap- 
tized in their infancy to join in the cele- 
bration of the Lord's supper with them : 
liecause they look upon such as not 
having been baptized at all, and conse- 

Juently cannot be admitted to the table. 
)thers, however, suppose that this 
ought to be no objection ; and that such 
who believe themselves to be really 
baptized (though in infancy,) are par- 
takers of orace, belong to the true 
church of Christ, and are traly devoted 
to God, ought not to be rejected on 
account of a different opinion about a 
mere ordinance. Mr. Killingworth and 
Mr. Booth haxG written against free 
communion ; John Bunvan, Dr. Foster, 
Mr. Bulkley, Mr. Wiclie, and Mr. Ro- 
binson, for it. 

COMMUNION, s/iiritual or divine, 
is that delightful fellowship and inter- 
course which a believer enjoys with 
God. It is founded upon union with 
him, and consists in a conmnunication of 
divine graces from him, and a return of 
devout affections to him. The believer 
holds communion witli God in his works, 
in his word, and in his ordinances. 
There can be no communion without

likeness, nor without Christ as the me- 
diator. Some distinguished commvmion 
with God from the sense and feeling of 
it; that is, that we may hold commu- 
nion with him without raptures of joy ; 
and that a saint, even under desertion, 
may have communion with God as 
really, though not so feeli?i^ly, as at any 
other time. This communion cannot be 
interrupted by any local mutations; it 
is far superior to all outward services 
and ordinances whatsoever ; it concerns 
the whole soul, all the affections, facul- 
ties, and motions of it being under its 
influence : it is only imperfect in this 
life, and will be unspeakably enlarged 
in a better world. — In order to keep up 
communion with God, we should inform 
ourselves of his will, John v. 39. be often 
in prayer, Luke viii. 1. embrace oppor- 
tunities of retirement, Ps. iv. 4. contem- 
Slate on the divine perfections, provi- 
ences, and promises, Ps. civ. 34. watch 
against a vain, trifling, and volatile 
spirit, Eph. iv. 30. and be found in the

COMPASSION is that species of 
affection which is excited either by the 
actual distress of its object, or by some 
impending calamity v/hich appears in- 
evitable. It is a benevolent soitow for 
the suiferings or approaching misery of 
another. The etymology oi the word 
expresses this idea with strict proprie- 
ty, as it signifies suffering ivith the ob- 
ject. Hobbes makes this a mere selfish 
f)assion, and defines it as "being fear 
or ourselves." Hutcheson resolves it 
into instinct; but Dr. Butler much more 
properly considers it as an original dis- 
tinct particular affection in human na- 
ture. It may be considered as a generic 
name, comprehending several other 
affections; as jnercy, commiseration, 
pity. This affection, (as well as every 
other of our nature,) no doubt, was 
wisely given us by our Creator. " Ideas 
of fitness," as Saurin observes, " sel- 
dom make much impression on the bulk 
of mankind; it was necessary therefore 
to make sensibility supply the want of 
reflection ; and by a counter-blow with 



which the miseries of a neighbour 
strike our feelings, to produce a dispo- 
sition in us to relieve him." 

COMPASSION OF (iOD is the in- 
finite greatness of his mercy and love, 
whereby he relieves the miseries of his 
people. This perfection of Jehovah is 
conspicuously displayed in the gift of 
his Son, John iii. 16. the revelation of 
his will, Hos. viii. 12. the bounties of 
his providence, Ps. cxlv. 9. the exercise 
of his patience, Rom. ii. 4. the promise 
of his mercy, Ps. Ixxviii. 38. the mani- 
festation of his presence, Matt, xviii. 
20. and the provision of eternal glory, 
1 Pet. i. 4. See Mercy.

COMPREHENSION, in English 
church history, denotes a scheme pro- 
posed by Sir Orlando Bridgman, in 
1667-8, for relaxing the temis of con- 
formity on behalf of the Protestant Dis- 
senters, and admitting them into the 
communion of the church. A bill for 
this purpose was drawn ir[) by Judge 
Hale, but disallowed. The attempt was 
renewed by Tillotson and Stillingfleet, 
in 16r4, and the terms were settled, to 
the satisfaction of the non-conformists ; 
but the bishops refused their assent. 
The scheme was likewise revived again 
immediately after the revolution. The 
king and queen expressed their desire 
of an union : however, the design failed, 
after two attempts, and the act of tole- 
ration was obtained. 

CONCEPTION OF CHRIST, the 
supernatural and miraculous formation 
of the human nature of Jesus Christ. 
"It were not difficult to shov&gt;'," says 
a divine, " that the miraculous concep- 
tion, once admitted, naturally brings up 
after it the great doctrines of the atone- 
ment and the incarnation. The mira- 
culous conception of our Lord evidently 
implies some higher purpose of his 
coming thai' the mere business of a 
teacher. The business of a teacher 
might have been performed by a mere 
man, enlightened by the prophetic spi- 
rit. For whatever instruction men have 
the capacity to receive, a man might 
have been made the instiiiment to con- 
vey. Had teaching, therefore, been the 
sole purpose of our Saviour's coming, a 
mere man might have done the whole 
business, and the supernatural concep- 
tion had been an unnecessary miracle. 
He, therefore, who came in this mira- 
culous way, came upon some higher 
business, to which a mere man was un- 
equal. He came to be made a sin 
offering for us, that we might be made 
the righteousness of God in him." See

between the Scotists and Thomists; the 
former maintaining and the latter im- 
pugning it. Peter D'Alva has published 
48 huge folio volumes on the mysteries 
of the conception. 

CONCLAVE, the assembly or meet- 
ing of the cardinals shut up for the 
election of a Pope. Conclave also sig- 
nifies the place in which the cardinals 
of the Romish church meet for the 
above-mentioned purpose. The con- 
clave is a range of small cells, ten feet 
square, made of wainscot : these are 
numbered, and drawn by lot. They 
stand in a line along the galleries and 
hall of the Vatican, with a small space 
between each. Every cell has the aiTns 
of the cardinal over it. The conclave is 
not fixed to any one determinate place, 
for the constitutions of the church al- 
low the cardinals to make choice of 
such a place for the conclave as they 
think most convenient : yet it is gene- 
rally held in the Vatican. — The con- 
clave is very strictly guarded by troops : 
neither the cardinals, nor any person 
shut up in the conclave, are spoken to, 
but at the hours allowed of, and then in 
Italian or Latin : even the provisions 
for the conclave are examined, that no 
letters be conveyed by that means from 
the ministers of foreign powers, or 
other persons, who may have an inte- 
rest in the election of the pontiff. 

CONCORD,/orw o/.— Form of con- 
cord, in ecclesiastical history, a stan- 
dard-book among the Lutherans, com- 
posed at Torgaw in 1576, and thence 
called the book of Torgaw, and review- 
ed at Berg by six Lutheran doctors of 
Germany, the principal of whom was 
James Anderse. This book contains, in 
two parts, a system of doctrine, the sub- 
scription of which v/as a condition of 
comrtiunion, and a formal and very se- 
vere condemnation of all who differed 
from the compilers of it; particularly 
with respect to the majesty and omni- 
presence of Christ's body, and the real 
manducation of his flesh and blood in the 
eucharist. It was first imposed upon the 
Saxons by Augustus, and occasioned 
great opposition and disturbance. The 
dispute about it was revived in Switzer- 
land in 1718, when the magistrates of 



Bern published an oixler for adopting it 
as a rule of faith ; the consequence of 
which was a contest that reduced its 
credit and authority. 

CONCORDANCE, a dictionary or 
index to the Bible, whereui all the lead- 
ing words are i-anged alphabetically, 
and the books, chapters, and verses 
wherein they occur referred to, to as- 
sist in finding out passages, and compa- 
ring with the several significations of 
the same word. Cardinal Hugo de St. 
Charo seems to have been the first who 
compiled a concordance to the Holy 
Scriptures ; and for caiTying on this 
work, it is said, he employed 500 monks 
to assist him. Rabbi Mo'rdecai Nathan 
published a Hebrew concordance, print- 
ed at Venice in 1523, containing all the 
Hebrew roots, branched into their va- 
rious significations, and under each sig- 
nification all the places in Scripture 
wherein it occurs; but the best and 
most useful Hebrew concordance is that 
of Buxtorf, printed at Basil in 1632. 
Calasius, an Italian cordelier, has given 
us concordances of the Hebrew, Latin, 
and Greek, in two columns : the first, 
which is Hebrew, is that of rabbi Mor- 
decai Nathan verbatim, and accordmg 
to the order of the books and chapters : 
in the other column is a Latin interpre- 
tation of each passage of Scripture 
quoted by R. Mordecai : this interpre- 
tation is Calasius's own; but in the 
margin he adds that of the LXX and 
the Vulgate, when different from his. 
The work is in 4 vols, folio, printed at 
Rome in 1521. A new edition of this 
work was published by subscription in 
London, in 1747, 8, 9, by Mr. Roraaine, 
to which he obtained the signature of 
every crowned head in Europe, his Ho- 
liness not excepted. Dr. Taylor pub- 
lished, in 1754, a Hebrew concordance, 
in 2 vols, folio, adapted to the English 
Bible, and disposed after the same man- 
ner as Buxtorf. This is perhaps the 
best for English readers. 

The Greek concordances are only 
for the New Testament, except one by 
Conrad Kircher on the Old, containing 
all the Hebrew words hi alphabetical 
order ; and underneath, all the inter- 
pretations of them in the LXX, and in 
each inteipretation all the places where 
they occur in that version. In 1718, 
Trommius published his Greek concor- 
dance for the LXX, at Amsterdam, in 
2 vols, folio ; and Schmidius, improving 
on a similar work of H. Stephen, has 
given an excellent Greek concord.mce 
for the New Testament, the best "fli- 
tion of which is that of Leipsic, anno 
1717. Williams's concordance to the

CONCUBINAGE, the act of living 
with a" woman to whom the man is not 
legally married. It is also used for a 
marriage with a woman of inferior con- 
dition (performed with less solemnity 
than the formal marriage,) and to whom 
the husband does not convey his rank. 
As polygamy Avas sometimes practised 
by the patriarchs, it was a common 
thing to see one, two, or many wives in 
a family, and besides these several con- 
cubines, 2 Sam. iii. 3, &amp;c. 1 Kings xi. 3. 
2 Chron. xi. 21 ; but ever since the 
abrogation of polygamy by Jesus Christ, 
and the reduction of marriage to its 
&lt;? primitive institution, concubinage has 
been forbidden and condemned among 
Christians. 

CONDESCENSION is that species 
of benevolence which designedlv waves 
the supposed advantages of birth, title, 
or station, in order to accommodate 
ourselves to the state of an inferior, and 
diminish that restraint wiiich the appa- 
rent distance is calculated to produce 
in him. It is enjoined on the Christian, 
and is peculiarly omam.ental to the 
Christian character, Rom. xii. 16. The 
condescension of God appears every 
•way gi'eat, when we consider his infinite 
perfection, his absolute independence of 
his creatures, his pui'poses of mercy to- 
ward them, and his continual care over 
them. 

CONDITION, a term of a bargain 
to be performed. It has been debated 
■whether /a/rA should be called the co7i- 
dition of our salvation. If by it we 
mean a valuable equivalent 'for the 
benefit received, or something to be 
performed in our OAvn strength, or that 
S\ill be meritorious, it is certainly in- 
applicable ; but if by it be meant, that 
it IS only a mean, without which we 
cannot be saved, in that sense it is not 
impi-oper. Yet as the term is often 



made use of improperly by those who 
are mere legalists, pei'haps it would be 
as well to decline the use of it. 

CONFERENCE, the act of discour- 
sing with another in order to treat upon 
some subject, or to settle some point of 
dispute. Conference Meetings, in a re- 
ligious sense, are meetings assembled 
for the puipose of relating experience, 
discoursing on some religious subject, 
or for transacting religious business. 
"Religious conference," says a divine, 
"is one v/ay of teaching religion. We 
all have leisure time, and it is well spent 
when it is employed in set conferences 
on religion. There the doubting inan 
may open all his suspicions, and con- 
firmed Christians will strengthen his 
belief; there the fearful may learn to be 
valiant for the truth ; there the liberal 
may learn to devise liberal things ; 
there the tongue of the stammerer 
may leani to speak plainly ; there 
Paul may withstand Peter to the face, 
because he deser\es to be blamed; 
there the Gospel may be communi- 
cated se\ei-aliy to them of reputation ; 
there, in one word, ^'e mav all prop'nesy 
one by one, that all may' learn, and all 
may be comforted. One hour in a week 
spent thus will contribute much to our 
edification, provided we abstain from 
the disorders that have often disgraced, 
and sometimes destroved, this excellent 
Christian practice. Time should be 
kept, order should be preserved, no 
idle qu.^^stion should be askecl; freedom 
of inquiry should be nourished ; immo- 
dest forwardness should be restrained ; 
practical, experimental, and substan- 
tial subjects should be examined ; 
Charity with all its'gentle train should 
be there, for slie openeth her mouth 
with wisdom, and in her tongue is the 
law of kindness." See Experience 
Meetings. 

CONFESSION, the verbal acknow- 
ledgment which a Christian makes of 
his sins. Among the Jews, it was the 
custom, on the annual fe:ist of expiation, 
for the high priest to make confession 
of sins to God, in the name of the whole 
people : besides this general confession, 
the Jews were enjoined, if tiieir sins 
were a breach of the first table of the 
law, to make confession of them to God ; 
but violations of the second table were 
to be acknowledged to their brethren. 
Confession, according to Dr. \'\'atts, is 
the third part of prayer, and includes, 
1. A confession of the meanness of our 
original, our distance from God, our 
subjection to him, and constant depen- 
dence on him. — 2. A confession ot our 
sins, both original and actual, m thought,

life, omission and commission.-— 3. A 
confession of our deseit of punishment, 
and our unworthiness of mercy- — 4. A 
confession or humble representation of 
our wants and sorrows of e\ery kind. 
Confession also may be considered as a 
relative duty, or the acknowledgment of 
any offence we have been i^uilty of against 
a fellow- creature. The Romish church 
requires confession not only as a duty, 
but has advanced it to the dignity of a 
sacrament. These confessions are made 
to the priest, and are private and auri- 
cular ; and the priest is not to i-e\'eal 
them under pam of the highest punish- 
ment. This, however, is both unneces- 
sary and unscriptural ; for, in the first 
place, there is no proof that the power 
of remitting and retaining sins (the 
pretended ground of sacramental con- 
fession) was impa.rted to any but the 
apostles, or at the most to those to whom 
a discernment of spirits were commu- 
nicated. — 2. If our Saviour had designed 
this to have been a duty, he would most 
probably have delivered us an express 
command to this purpose. — 3. This au- 
thority of pardoning sins immediately 
in relation to (iod (the foundation of the 
pretended duty of secret confession,) 
without any reference to church cen- 
sures, was never claimed for many ages 
after Christ. 

Notwithstanding, howe\'er, private 
auricular confession is not of divme au- 
thority, yet, as one observes, "there are 
many cases wherein men under the guilt 
and trouble of their sins can neither ap- 
pease their own minds, nor sufficiently 
direct themsch^es without recourse to 
some pious and prudent guide: in these 
cases men certainly do vei-y well, and 
many times prevent a great deal of trou- 
l)le and perplexity to themselves by a 
timely discoveiy of their condition to 
some faitliful minister; and to this pur- 
pose a general confession is for the most 
part sufficient : and where there is oc- 
casion for a more particular discovery, 
there is no need of raking into the par- 
ticular circumstances of men's sins to 
}^ive that advice which is necessary for 
the ease and comfort of the penitent."

Tillotson^s Ser., ser. 160, 161 ; Smith's 
Errors of the Church of Rome. 

CONFESSION OF FAITH, a list 
of the several articles of the belief of 
any church. There is some difference 
between creeds and confessions. Creeds 
in their commencement were simply 
expressions of faith in a few of the 
leading and undisputed doctrines of the 
Gospel. Confessions were on the con- 
trary the result of many an hazardous 



and laborious effort, at the dawn of re- 
viving literature to recover these doc- 
trines, and to separate them from the 
enormous mass of erroneous and cor- 
rupted tenets, which the negligence or 
ignorance of some, and the artifices of 

i avarice and ambition in others, had con- 

I duced to accumulate for a space of 1000 
years, under an implicit obedience to 

I the arrogant pretensions of an absolute 
and infallible authority in the church of 
Rome. Objections have been formed 
against all creeds or confessions of faith, 
as it is said they infringe Christian li- 
berty, supersede the Scriptures, ex- 
clude such as ought not to be excluded, 
and admit such as ought not to be ad- 
mitted; are often too particular and 
long ; are liable to be abused ; tempt 
men to hvpocrisy; preclude improve- 
ment; and have been employed as 
means of persecution. On the other 
hand, the advocates for them observe, 
that all the arts and sciences have been 
reduced to a system ; and why should 
not the ti-uths of religion, which are of 
greater importance ? That a compen- 
dious view of the chief and most neces- 
sarv points of the Christian religion, 
which lie scattered up and down in the 
Scripture, must be useful to inform the 
mind, as well also to hold forth to the 
world what are in general the senti- 
ments of such a pai'ticular church or 
churches; they tend to discover the 
common friends of the same faith to one 
anotlier, and to unite tliem ; that the 
Scriptures seem to authorize and coun- 
tenance them ;' such as the moral law, 
the Lord's prayer, the form of doctrine 
mentioned by Paul, Rom. vi. 17; and 
again, "the form of sound words," in 
2 Tim. i. 13, SvC. ; that their becoming 
the occasion of hypoo'isy is no fault of 
the articles, but of those who subscribe 
them ; that persecution has been i'aised 
more by the turbulent tempers of meii 
than from the nature of confessions. 
Some think that all articles and confes- 
sions of faith should be expressed in the 
bare words of Scripture ; but it is re- 
plied, that tliis would destroy all expo- 
sition and interpretation of Scripture ; 
that it would have a tendency to make 
the ministry of the word useless ; in a 
great measure cramp all religious con- 
versation ; and that the sentiments ot 

I one man could not be disting;uis]ied 
from another in some ])oints of impor- 
tance. Some of the most noted confes- 
sions are, the 39 Articles, and the con- 
stitutions and canons of the church of 
England; the IVestmiuster Assembly's 
Confession of Faith ; the Savoy Con- 
fession, or a declaration of the faith

CONFESSOR, a Christian who has 
made a solemn and resolute profession 
of the faith, and has endured torments 
in its defence. A mere saint is called 
a confessor, to distinguish him from the 
roll of dignified saints, such as apostles, 
martjrs. Sec. In ecclesiastical history, 
the word confessor is sometimes used 
for martyr ; in after times it was con- 
fined to those who, after having been 
tormented by the tyrants, were per- 
mitted to live and die in peace ; and at 
last it was also used for those who, after | 
haying lived a good life, died under an 
opinion of sanctity. According to St. 
Cyprian, he who presented himself to 
torture, or even to martyrdom, without 
being called to it, was not called a con- 
fessor h^^iX. a professor; and if any out 
of want of courage abandoned his coun- 
tiy, and became a voluntary exile for 
the sake of the faith, he was called ex- 
terras. 

Confessor is also a priest in the Ro- 
mish church, who has a power to hear 
sinnei-s in the sacrament, of penance, 
and to give them absolution. The con- 
fessors of the kings of France, from the 
time of Henry IV. have been constantlv 
Jesuits; before him, the Dominicans 
and Cordeliers shared the office ht- 
tween them. The confessors of the 
house of Austria, have also ordinarily 
been Dominicans and Cordeliers, but 
the latter emperors have all taken 
Jesuits. 

CONFIRMATION, the act of esta- 
blishing any thing or person. — 1. Divine 
confirmation is a work of the Spirit of 
God, strengthening, comforting, and 
establishing believers in faith and obe- 
dience, 1st. Pet. V. 10. 1st. Cor. i. 8. — 2. 
Ecclesiastical covfrmation is a rite 
■whereby a person, arrived to years of 
discretion, undertalics the performance 
of every part of the baptismal vow 
made for him by his godfathers and 
godmothers. 

In the pi'imitive church it was done 
immediately after baptism, if the bishop 



happened to be present at the solem- 
nity. Throughout the East it still ac- 
companies baptism ; but the Romanists 
make it a distinct independent sacra- 
ment. Seven years is the stated time 
for confirmation; however, they are 
sometimes after that age. The person 
to be confirmed has a godfather and 
godmother appointed him, as in bap- 
tism. In the chui'ch of England, the 
age of the persons to be confirmed is 
not fixed. Clark's Essay on Confir- 
mation; Wood on ditto; How's Epis- 
copacy, p. 167, 174. 

CONFLAGRATION, GENERAL, 
a term used to denote that gi'and period 
or catastrophe of our world, when the 
face of nature is to be changed by fire, 
as formerly it was by water. 

1. Scripture assures us in the general, 
that this earth in its present form will 
not be perpetual, but shall come to an 
end. — 2. It farther tells us, that this dis- 
solution of the world shall be by a gene- 
ral conflagration, in which all things 
upon the face of the earth shall be de- 
stroyed, by wliich the atmosphere shall 
also be sensibly affected, as in such a 
case it necessarily must be, 2 Pet. iii. 
5 — 7. 10. 12. where, from the connec- 
tion of the words, the opposition be- 
tv/ecn the conflagration and the deluge, 
as well as the most literal and apparent 
import of the phrases themselves, it is 
plain they cannot, as Dr. Hammond 
strangely supposes, refer to the desola- 
tion brought on Judea when destroyed 
by the Rom.ans, but must refer to "the 
dissolution of the whole earth. — 3. The 
Scripture represents this great burn- 
ing as a circumstance nearly connected 
with the day of judgment, 2 Pet. iii. 7. 
compared with 2 Thess. i. 7, 8. Heb. 
x. 27. 1 Cor. iii. 12, 13 ; and it is proba- 
ble that there may be an allusion to this 
in several passages of the Old Testa- 
ment, such as Ps. xi. 6. Ps. 1. 3. Ps. 
xcvi. 3. Is. xxxiv. 4. 8. 10. Is. Ixvi. 15. 
Dan. vii. 9, 10. Mai. iv. 1. Zeph. iii. 8. 
Deut. xxxii. 22. to which many parallel 
expressions might be added, fi'om t':e 
canonical and apocryphal books. — 4. It 
is not expressly declared how this burn- 
ing shall be kindled, nor how it shall 
end ; which has given occasion to va- 
rious conjectures about it, which see 
below. 

The ancient Pythagoreans, Platonists, 
Epicureans, and Stoics, appear to have 
had a notion of the conflagration ; though 
whence they should derive it, unless 
from the sacred books, is difficult to 
conceive ; except, perhaps, from the 
Phoenicians, who themselves had it from 
the Jews. Mention of the conflagration 



CON 



111 



CON 



is made in the books of the Sibyls, So- 
phocles, Hystaspes, Ovid, Lucan, &amp;c. 
Dr. ijurnet, after J. Tachard and others, 
relates that the Siamese believe that 
the earth will at last be parched up 
with heat, the mountains melted down, 
the earth's whole surface reduced to a 
level, and then consumed with fire. 
And the Bramins of Siam do not only 
hold that the world shall be destroyed 
by fire, but also that a new eaith shall 
be made out of the cinders of the old. 

Divines ordinarily account for the 
conflagration metaphysically, and will 
have it take its rise from a miracle, as 
a fire from heaven. Philosophers con- 
tend for its being produced from natural 
causes, and will have it effected accor- 
ding to the laws of mechanics. Some 
think an eruption of the central fire 
sufficient for the pui-pose ; and add, that 
this may be occasioned several ways, 
viz. either by having its intention in- 
creased, which again may be effected 
either by being driven into less space 
by the encroachments of the superfi- 
cial cold, or by an increase of the in- 
flammability of the fiiel whereon it is 
fed ; or by having the resistance of the 
imprisoning earth weakened, which may 
happen either from the diminution of 
its matter, by the consumption of its 
central parts, or by weakening the co- 
hesion of the constituent parts of the 
mass by the excess of the defect of 
moisture. Others look for the cause of 
the conflagration in the atmosphere, and 
suppose that some of the meteors there 
engeiidered in unusual quantities, and 
exploded with unusual vehemence, from 
the concurrence of various circumstan- 
ces, may effect it without seeking any 
farther. — Lastly, others have I'ecourse 
to a still more effectual and flaming 
machine, and conclude the world is to 
undergo its conflagration from the near 
approach of a comet in its return from 
the sun. 

Various opinions also are entertained 
as to the renovation of the earth after 
the conflagration. — 1. Some suppose that 
the earth will not be entirely consumed, 
but that the matter of which it consists 
will be fixed, purified, and refined, 
which they say will be the natural con- 
sequence of the action of fire upon it ; 
though it is hai-d to say what such a 
purification can do towards fitting it for 
its intended purpose, for it is certain a 
mass of crystal or glass would very ill 
answer the following parts of this "hy- 
pothejiis. — 2. They suppose that from 
these 'materials thus refined, as from a 
second chaos, there will by the power 
of God arise a new creation; and then 



the face of the earth, and likewise the 
atmosphere, will then be so restored, 
as to resemble what it originally was in 
the'paradisaical state ; and consequently 
to render it a more desirable abode for 
human creatures tiian it at present is t 
and they urge for this purpose the fol- 
lowing texts, viz. 2 Pet. lii. 13. (com- 
pare Is. Ixv. 17. Ixvi. 22.) Matt. xix. 
28, 29. (compare Mark x. 29, 30. Luke 
xviii. 29, 30.) Ps. cii. 25,26. Acts iii. 21, 
1 Cor. vii. 31. Rom. viii. 21. — 3. They 
agree in supposing, that in this new 
state of things there will be no sea. 
Rev. xxi. 1. — 4. They suppose that the 
earth, thus beautified and improved, 
shall be inhabited by those who shall 
inherit the first resurrection, and shall 
here enjoy a very considerable degree 
of happiness, though not equal to that 
v/hich is to succeed the general judg- 
ment ; which judgment shall, according 
to them, open when those thousand 
years are expired, mentioned in Rev. 
XX. 4, &amp;c. 1 Thess. iv. 17. compare 
ver. 15., which passage is thought by 
some to contain an insinuation that Paiil 
expected to be alive at the appearance . 
of Christ, which must imply an ex- 
pectation of being thus raised from the 
dead before it : but it is answered that 
the expression we that are alive may 
only signify "that of us that are so,'' 
speaking of all Christians as one body, 
1st Cor. XV. 49—52. Dr. Hartley de- 
clared it as his opinion, that the m.illen- 
nium will consist of a thousand prophe- 
tical years, wliere each day is a year, 
i. e. 360,000 ; pleading that this is the 
language used in other parts of the 
Revelation. But it seems an invincible 
objection against this hypothesis, which 
places the millennium after the confla- 
gration, that the saints inhabiting the 
earth after the first resurrection are 
represented as distressed by the inva- 
sion of some v/icked enemies. Rev. xx. 
7 — 9. Ezekiel xxxviii. xxxix. See 
Millennium. 

After all, little can be said with cer- 
tainty as to this subject. It is probable 
that the earth will survive its fiery trial, 
and become the everlasting abode of 
righteousness, as part of the holy em- 
pire of God; but, seeing the language 
used in Scripture, and especially in the 
book of Revelation, is often to be con- 
sidered as figurative rather than literal, 
it becomes us to be cautious in our con- 
clusions. Burnet's Theory of the Earth;

CONFUSION OF TONGUES, a 

memorable event which happened in 
the one hundred and first year, accord- 
ing to the Hebrew chronology, and the 
four hundred and first year by the Sa- 
maritan, after the flood, at the over- 
throw of Babel, Gen. xi. Until this pe- 
riod there had been but one common 
language, which formed a bond of union 
that prevented the separation of man- 
kind into distinct nations. Writers have 
differed much as to the nature of this 
confusion, and the manner in which it 
was effected. Some think that no new 
languages were foi-med; but that this 
event was accompli slied by creating a 
misunderstanding and variance among 
the builders without any immediate in- 
fluence on their language ; and that a 
distinction is to be made between coii- 
Jbifnding- a language and forming new 
ones. Others account for this event by 
the privation of all langojage, and by 
supposing that mankind were under a 
necessity of associating together, and of 
imposing new names on things by com- 
mon consent. Some, again, ascribe the 
confusion to such an indistinct remem- 
brance of the original language which 
they spoke before, as made them speak 
it very differently : but the most com- 
mon opinion is, that God caused the 
builders actually to forget their former 
language, and each family to speak a 
new tongue; whence originated the va- 
rious languages at present in the world. 
It is, however, but of little consequence 
to know precisely how this was effected, 
as the Scriptures are silent as to the 
manner of it ; and after all that can be 
said, it is but conjecture still. There 
are some truths, however, we may learn 
from this part of sacred writ. — 1. It 
teaches us God's sovereignty and pow- 
er, by which he can easily blast the 
greatest attempts of men to aggrandize 
themselves. Gen. xi. 7, 8.-2. God's 
justice in punishing of those who, in ido- 
lizing their own fame, forget him to 
whom praise is duc.ver. 4. — 3. God's 
wisdom m overruling evil for good ; for 
by this confusion he facilitated the dis- 
persion of mankind, in order to execute 
his own purposes, ver. 8, 9. See Henry 
and Gill in loc. St illin,;:^ fleets Orig. Sac.

CONGREGATION, anassembly of 
people met together for religious wor- 
ship. The term has been also used for 
assemblies of cardinals appointed by 
the pope for the discharge of certain 



functions, after the manner of our office? 
and courts ; such as tlie congregation 
of the i?ic/uis/tion, the congregation of 
rites of aijns, &amp;c. &amp;c. — It also signifies 
a company or society of i-eligious per- 
sons cantoned out .of this or that order, 
and making an inferior o)'der, &amp;c. Such 
are the congregations of the Oratory ; 
those of Cluny, Sec. among the Bene- 
dictines. 

CONGREGATIONALISTS, a de- 
nomination of Protestants Avho reject all 
church government, except that of a 
single congregation under the direction 
of one pastor, with their elders, assis- 
tants, or m.anagers. See Church. 

C( )NONITES, a denomination which 
appeared in the sixth century. They de- 
rived their name from Conon, bishop of 
Tarsus. He t.iught that the body never 
lost its form ; that its matter alone was 
subject to corruption and decay, and 
was to be restored when this mortal 
shall ytnt on immortality. 

CONSCIENCE signifies knowledge 
in conjunction ; that is, in conjunction 
with the fact to which it is a witness, 
as the eye is to the action done before 
it ; or, as South observes, it is a double 
or Joint knowledge, namely, one of a 
divine law or nile, and the other of a 
man's own action. It may be defined to 
be the judgment which a man passes on 
the morality of his actions as to their 
purity or turpitude ; or the secret tes- 
timony of the soul, whereby it approves 
things that are good, and condemns 
those that arc evil. Some object to its 
being called an act, habit, or facult\% 
An act, say they, would be represented 
as an agent, whereas conscience is a tes- 
timony. To say it is a habit, is to speak 
of it as a disposition acting, which is 
scarce more accurate than ascribing 
one act to another; and, besides, it 
would be strange language to say that 
conscience itself is a habit. Against de- 
fining it by the name of a power or fa- 
culty, it is objected, that it occasions a 
false notion of it, as a distinct power 
from reason. 

The rules of co?iscience. We must 
distinguish between a rule that of itself 
and immediately binds the conscience, 
and a rule that is occasionally of use to 
direct and satisfy the conscience. Novf 
in the first sense the will of God is the 
only rule immediately binding the con- 
science. No one has authority over the 
conscience but God. All penal laws, 
therefore, in matters of mere conscience, 
or things that do not evidently affect the . 
civil state, are certainly unlawful ; yet, 
secondly, the commands of superiors, 
not only natural parents, but civil, as 



CON 



ii: 



magistrates or masters, and eveiy man's 
private engagements, are rules of con- 
science in things indifferent. — 3. The 
examples of wise and good men may 
become rules of conscience : but here it 
must be observed, that no example or 
judgment is of any authority against 
law : where the law is doubtful, and 
even where there is no doubt, the side 
of example cannot be taken till enquiry 
has been first made concerning what 
the law directs. 

Conscience has been considered, as, 
1. natural, or that com.mon principle 
which instructs men of all countries and 
religions in the duties to which they are 
all alike obliged. There seems to be 
something of this in the minds of all 
men. Even in the darkest regions of 
the earth, and among the inidest tribes 
of men, a distinction has ever been 
made between just and unjust, a duty, 
and a crime. 

2. A right conscience is that which 
decides aright, or, according to the only 
rule of rectitude, the law of God. This 
is also called a iv ell-informed conscience, 
which in all its decisions proceeds upon 
the most evident principles of tiiith. 

o. A probable conscience is that which, 
in cases which admit of the brightest and 
fullest light, contents itself with bare 
probabilities. The consciences of many 
are of no higher character; and though 
we must not say a man cannot be saved 
with such a conscience, yet such a con- 
science is not so perfect as it might be. 

4. An ignorant conscience is that 
which may declare right, but, as it 
were, by chance, and without any just 
ground to build on. 

5. An erroneous conscience is a con- 
science mistaken in its decisions about 
the nature of actions. 

6. A doubting conscience is a con- 
science unresolved about tlie nature of 
actions ; on account of the equal or near- 
ly equal probabilities which appear for 
and against each side of the question. 

7. Of an evil conscience there are se- 
veral kinds. Conscience, in regard to 
actions in general, is evil when it has 
lost more or less the sense it ought to 
have of the natural distinctions of moral 
good and evil : this is a polluted or de- 
hied conscience. Conscience is evil in 
itself when it gives either none or a false 
testimony as to past actions ; when re- 
flecting upon wickedness it feels no 
pains, it is evil, and said to be seared or 
hardened, 1 Tim. iv. 2. It is also evil 
when during the commission of sin it 
lies quiet. In regard to future actions, 
conscience is evil if it does not startle at 
the proposal of sin, or connives at the 
commission of A. 



CON 

For the right management of con- 
science, we should, 1. Endeavour to ob- 
tain acquaintance with the law of God, 
and with our own tempers and lives, and 
frequently compare tiiem together. 

2. Furnish conscience with general 
principles of the most extensive nature 
and strongest influence ; such as the su- 
preme love of God ; love to our neigh- 
bours as ourselves ; and that tlic care of 
our souls is of the greatest importance. 

3. Preserve the purity of conscience. 

4. Maintain the freedom of conscience, 
particularly against interest, passion, 
temper, example, and the authority of 
great names. 

5. We should accustom ourselves to 
cool reflections on our past actions. See 
Gro-ve's and Palei/s Moral Philoso- 
phy ; South^s Sermons, vol. ii. sermon 
12 ; and books under Casuistry. 

CONSCIOUSNESS, the perception 
of what passes in a man's own mind. 
We mu.st not confound the terms con- 
scioifsness and conscience ; for though 
the Latin be ignorant of any such dis- 
tinction, including both in the word cou" 
scientia, yet there is a great deal of dif- 
ference between them in our language. 
Consciousness is confined to the actions 
of the mind, being nothing else but that 
knowledge of itself which is insepara- 
ble from even'^ thought and voluntary 
motion of the soul. Conscience extends 
to all human actions, bodily as well as 
mental. Consciousness is the knowledge 
of the existence ; conscience of the mo- 
ral nature of actions. Consciousness is 
a province of metaphysics ; conscience 
of moralitv. 

CONSECRATION, a rite or cere- 
mony of dedicating things or persons to 
the service of God. It is used for the 
benediction of the elements at the 
eucharist : the ordination of bishops is 
also called consecration. 

The Mosaical law ordained that all 
the first-born, both of man and beast, 
should be sanctified or consecrated to 
God. We find also, that Joshua conse- 
crated the Gibeonites, as David and So- 
lomon did the Nethinims, to the service 
of the temple ; and that the Hebrews 
sometimes consecrated their fields and 
cattle to the Lord, after which tlicy 
were no longer in their power. Among 
the ancient Christians, tlie consecratioa 
of churches was performed with a great 
deal of pious solemnity. In what manner 
it was done for tlie first three ages is un- 
certain, the authentic accounts reach" 
mg no higher than the fourth century, 
when, in the peaceable reign of Con- 
stantine. churches were e\eiy where 
built and dedicated v.-ith great solemoi-

tv. The Romanists have a great deal of 
foppery in the ceremonies of consecra- 
tion, which they bestow on almost every 
thing ; as bells, candles, books, Avater, 
oil, ashes, palms, swords, banners, pic- 
tnrcs, crosses, agnus deis, roses, 8cc. In 
England, churches have been always 
consecrated with particular ceremonies, 
the form of which was left to the discre- 
tion of the bishop. That observed by 
Abp. Land, in conseci-ating Saint Cathe- 
rine Cree church in London, gave gi-cat 
offence, and well it might. It was enough, 
as one observes, to have made even a 
popish cardinal blush, and which no 
Protestant can read but with indignant 
concern. "The bishoji came attended 
Avith several of the high commission, 
and some civihans. At his approach to 
the west door of the church, which was 
shut, and guarded by halberdeers, some 
that were appointed for that purpose 
cried with a loud voice — Open, ofieii, ije 
everlasting doors, that the King of Glo- 
ry may coine in! Presently the dooi's 
were opened, and the bishop, Avith some 
doctors and principal men, entered. As 
soon as they Avere Avithin the place, his 
lordship fell doAvn upon his knees ; and, 
Avith his eyes lifted up, and his arms 
spread abroad, said. This place is holy ; 
the ground is holy : in the name of the 
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, r pro- 
nounce it holy. . Then, Avalking up the 
middle aisle tOAvards the chancel, he 
took up some of the dust, and threAV it 
into the air sevei*al times. \\'hen he ap- 
proached near the rail of the commu- 
nion table, he boAved towards it five or 
six times; and, returning, Avent round the 
church, Avith his attendants in proces- 
sion ; saying first the hundredth and then 
the nineteenth Psalm, as prescribed in 
the Roinan Pontifical. He then read 
several collects, in one of Avhich he prays 
God to accept of that beautiful building, 
and concludes thus: JVe consecrate this 
church, u)id separate it unto thee as 
Holy Ground, not to be profaned any 
more to common use. In another he 
prays — That ALL voho should hereaf- 
ter be buried within the circuit of this 
holy and sacred place, may rest in their 
sepulchres in peace, till Christ's coming 
to Judgment, and nicy then rise to eter- 
nal life and happiness. Then the bishop, 
sitting under a cloth of state in the aisle 
of the chancel, near the communion ta- 
ble, took a written book in his hand, and 
pronounced ctascs upon those Avho 
should hereafter profane that holi/ place 
by musters of soldiers, or keeping pro- 
fane laAV courts, or carrying burdens 
through it; and at the end of every 
curse he bowed to the east, and saidi, 



Let all the people say. .iincn. When 
the curses Avere ended, Avhich Avere 
about tAventy, he pronounced a like 
number of blessings upon ALL that had 
any hand in framnig and building that 
sacred and beautiful church ; and on 
those that had given, or should hereafter 
give, any chalices, plate, ornaments, or 
other utensils ; and, at the end of every 
blessing, he bowed to the east, and said. 
Let all the people say, Amen. After this 
came the sermon, then the sacrament, 
Avhich the bishop consecrated and ad- 
ministered in the following manner : — 
As he approached the altar, lie made 
five or SIX Ioav boAvs ; and coming up to 
the side of it, Avhere the bread and wine 
were covered, he bowed seven times. 
Then, after reading many prayers, he 
came near the bread, and, gently lifting 
up the corner of the napkin, beheld it ; 
and immediately letting fall tlie napkin, 
he retreated hastily a step or tAvo, and 
made three Ioav obeisances: his lordship 
then advanced, and, having uncovered 
the bread, boAved three times as before. 
Then he laid his hand on the cup, Avhich 
Avas full of Avine, Avith a cover upon it ; 
Avhicii haA'ing let go, he stepped back, 
and boAved three times tOAvai'ds it; then 
he came near again, and lifting up the 
cover of the cup, looked in it ; and see- 
ing the wine, let fall the cover again, re- 
tired l)ack, and bowed as before. Then 
the elements Avere consecrated ; and 
the bishop, having first received, gave 
it to some principal men in their sur- 
plices, hoods, and tippets ; after Avhich, 
many prayers l)eing said, the solemnity 
of the consecration ended." 

CONSISTENTES, a kind of peni- 
tents, Avho were alloAved to assist at 
prayers, Ijut who could not be admitted 
to receive tlie sacrament. 

CONSISTORY, a Avord commonly 
used for a council house of ecclesiastical 
persons, or j)lace of justice in the spi- 
ritual court : a session or assembly of 
prelates. Every archbishop and bishop 
of every diocese hath a consistory court, 
held before his chancellor or commis- 
sar)', in his cathedral church, or other 
convenient place of his diocese for ec- 
clesiastical causes. The bishop's chan- 
cellor is the judge of this court, suppo- 
sed to be skilled in the civil and canon 
law ; and in places of tlie diocese far 
remote from the bishop's consistorj^, the 
bishop appoints a commissary to judge 
in all causes within a certain district, 
and a register to enter his decrees, &amp;c. 
Consistory at Rome, denotes the college 
of cardinals, or the pope's senate and 
council, before Avhom judiciaiy causes 
are pleaded. Consistoiy is also used

among the reformed for a council or as- 
sembly of ministers and elders to regu- 
late their affairs, discipline, &amp;:c. 

CONSTANCY, in a general sense, 
denotes immutability, or invariableness. 
When applied to the human mind, it is 
a steady adherence to those schemes 
and resolutions which have been ma- 
turely formed ; the effect of which is, 
that a man nc\ er drops a good design 
out of fear, and is consistent with him- 
self in all his words and actions. 

Constancy is more particularly requi- 
red of us. — 1. In our devotions, Luke 
xviii. 1. 1 Thess. v. 17, 18. — 2. Under 
our sufferings, Matt. v. 1 2, 13. 1 Pet. iv. 
12, 13. — 3. In our profession and cha- 
racter, Heb. X. 23. — 4. In our benefi- 
cence, Gal. vi. 9. — 5. In our friendships, 
Prov. xxvii. 10. 

CONSUBSTANTIAL, a term of 
like import with co-essential, denoting 
something of the same substance witli 
another. Thus we say that Christ is 
consubstantial with the Father. The 
term oM-»crioi, consubstantial, was first 
adopted by the fathers of the councils of 
Antioch and Nice, to express the ortho- 
dox doctrine the more precisely, and to 
serve as a barrier and precaution against 
the errors and subtleties of the Arians, 
who owned every thing except the con- 
substantiality. The Arians allowed that 
the word was God, as having been made 
God ; but they denied that he was the 
same God, and of the same substance 
with the Father : accordingly they ex- 
erted themselves to the utmost to abo- 
lish the use of the word. The emperor 
Constantine used all his authoritv- with 
the bishops to have it expunged out of 
the symbols; but it was retained, and 
is at this day, as it was then, the distin- 
guishing criterion between an Athana- 
sian and an Arian. See articles Arians, 
and Jesus Christ. 

CONSUBSTANTIATION, a tenet 
of the Lutheran church, with regard to 
the manner of the change made in the 
bread and wine in the eucharist. The 
divines of that profession maintain that, 
after consecration, the body and blood 
of our Saviour are substantially ]:&gt; resent, 
together with the substance of the bread I 
and wine, which is called consubstantia- I 
tion, or impanation. See Transub- j 

STANTIATION. 

CONTEMPLATION, studious 
thought on any subject; continued at- 
tention. " Monks and mystics consider 
contemfilation as the highest degree of 
moral excellence ; and with them a si- 
lent spectator is a divine man :" but it is 
evident we are not placed here only to 
think. There is something to be done 



as well as to contemplate. There are 
duties to be performed, offices to be dis- 
charged : and if we wish to be happy 
in ourselves, and useful to others, we 
must be active as well as thoughtful. 

CONTENTMENT is a disposition 
of mind in which our desires are confi- 
ned to what we enjoy, without murmur- 
ing at our lot, or wishing ardently for 
more. It stands opposed to envy, James 
iii. 16. to avarice, Heb. xiii. 5. to pride 
and ambition, Prov. xiii. 10. to anxiety 
of mind, Matt. vi. 25, 34. to murmur- 
ings and rcpinings, 1 Cor. x. 10. Con- 
tentment does not imply unconcern 
abovit our welfare, or that we should not 
have a sense of any thing uneasy or dis- 
tressing; nor does it give any counte- 
nance to idleness, or prevent diligent 
endeavours to improve our circumstan- 
ces. It implies, however, that our de- 
sires of worldly good be moderate ; that 
we do not indulge unnecessary care, or 
use unlawful efforts to better ourselves ; 
but that we acquiesce with and make 
the best of our condition, whatever it be. 
Contentment arises not from a man's 
outward condition, but from his inwaid 
disposition, and is the genuine offspring 
of humility, attended with a fixed ha- 
bitual sense of God's particular provi- 
dence, the recollection of past mercies, 
and a just estimate of the true nature of 
all earthly things. Motives to content- 
ment arise from the consideration of the 
rectitude of the Divine government, Ps. 
xcvii. 1, 2. the benignity of the Divine 
providence, Ps. cxlv. the greatness of 
the Divine promises, 2 Pet. i. 4. our own 
unworthiness, Gen. xxxii. 10. the pun- 
ishments we deserve. Lam. iii. 39, 40. 
the reward which contentment itself 
brings with it, 1 Tim. vi. 6. the speedy 
termination of ail our troubles here, and 
the prospect of eternal felicity in a fu- 
ture state, Rom. v. 2. Barrow's Works, 
vol. iii. ser. 5, 6, 7,8,9; Burroughs on 
Contentment; WatsOTi's ./irt of ditto i 
Hale's Co/1, p. 59; Mason's Christian. 
Morals, vol. i. ser. 2. 

CONTINENCY is that moral virtue 
by which we resti-ain concupiscence. 
There is this distinction betv/een chas- 
tity and continence : — Chastity requires 
no' effort, because it may result from 
constitution ; whereas continency ap- 
pears to be the consequence of a \'ictor3'" 
gained over ourselves. The term is 
most usually applied to men ; as chas- 
tity is to wfimen. See Chastity. 

CONTINGENT, any thing that 
happens without a fore-known cause ; 
commonly called accidental. An event 
not come to pass is said to be contingent, 
which either may or may not be : what 



CON 



116 



CON 



is already" done, is said to liave been 
contingent, if it might or might not have 
been. What is contingent or casual to 
us is not so with God. As effects stand 
related to a second cause, they are 
many times contingent ; but as they 
stand related to the first cause, they are 
acts of God's counsel, and directed by 
his wisdom. 

CONTRITE: this word signifies beat- 
en or bruised, as with hard blows, or an 
heavy burden ; and so in Scripture lan- 
guage imports one whose heart is bro- 
ken and wounded for sin, in opposition 
to the heart of stone, Is. Ixvi. 2. Ps. li. 
17. Ps. Ivii. 15. 

The evidences of a broken and con- 
trite spirit are, 1. Deep conviction of the 
evil ofsin. — 2. Humiliation under a sense 
of it. Job xlii. 5, 6. — 3. Pungent sorrow 
for it, Zech. xii. 10. — 4. Ingenuous con- 
fession of it, 1 John i. 9. — 5. Prayer for 
deliverance from it, Ps. li. 10. Luke

CONVENT. See Abbey, Moicas- 
TERY, Monk. 

CONVENTICLE, a diminutive of 
convent, denoting properly a cabal, or 
seci'et assembly of a part of the monks 
of a convent, to make a party in the 
election of an abbot. The term conven- 
ticle is said by some to have been first 
applied in England to the schools of 
Wickliffe, and has been since used in a 
%vay of reproach for those assemblies 
which dissent from the established 
church. 

In 1664- what was called the conventi- 
cle act was passed, decreeing that if any 
person above 16 years of age, was pre- 
sent at any meeting for worship, differ- 
ent from the church of England, wliere 
there should be five persons more than 
the household, they should for the first 
offence, suffer three months imprison- 
ment, or pay 5/. for the second the pun- 
'ishment is doubled, and for the third 
they were to be banished to America, 
or pay 100/. and if they retunied to suf- 
fer death. This act having expii-ed, it 
was revived m 1669, for by 22 Car. II. 
cap. 1. it is enacted. That if any persons 
of the age of sixteen years, subjects of 
this kingdom, shall be present at any 
conventicle v/here there are five or more 
assembled, they shall be fined five shil- 
lings for the first offence, and ten shil- 
lings for the second: and persons 
preaching, incur a penalty of twenty 
pounds. Also suffering a meeting to be 
held in a house is twenty pounds penal- 
ty : justices of peace have power to en- 



ter such houses, and seize persons as- 
sembled: and if they neglect their duty, 
they forfeit 100/. And if any constable, 
&amp;c. know of such proceedings, and do 
not inform a justice of peace or chief 
magistrate, he shall forfeit 5/. But the 
1st of William and Mary, cap. 18. or- 
dains that Protestant dissenters shall be 
exempted from these penalties ; though 
if they meet in a house with the doors 
locked, barred, or bolted, such dissen- 
ters shall have no benefit from the 1st 
of William and Mary. Officers of the 
government, &amp;c. present at any conven- 
ticle at which there shall be ten per- 
sons, if the royal family be not prayed 
for in express words, shall forfeit 40/. 
and be disabled, Stat. 10. Anne, cap. 2. 

CONVERSATION, or discourse, 
signifies an interlocution between two or 
more persons, with this distinction, that 
conversation is used for any general 
intercourse of sentiments whatever, 
whereas a discourse means a conversa- 
tion limited to some particular subject. 

To render conversation at all times 
agreeable, the following rales have been 
laid down, 1. The parties should meet 
together with a determined resolution 
to please and to be pleased. — 2. No one 
slioiild be eager to interrupt others, or 
be uneasy at being interrupted. — 3. All 
should have leave to speak in turn. — 4. 
Inattention should be carefully avoid- 
ed. — 5. Private concerns should never 
be mentioned, unless particularly en- 
quired into, and even then as briefly as 
possible. — 6. Each person should, as far 
as propriety will admit, be afforded an 
opportunity of discoursing on the sub- 
ject with which he is best acquainted. — 

7. Stories should be avoided, unless 
short, pointed, and quite a firojios. — 

8. Each person should speak often, but 
not long. Haranguing in private com- 
pany is insupportable. — 9. If the majo- 
rity of the company be naturally silent 
or reserved, the conversation will flag, 
unless it I^e often renewed by one who 
can start new subjects. — 10. It is im- 
proper to laugli at one's own wit and 
humour; this should be left to the com- 
pany. — 11. When the conversation is 
flowing in a serious and usefid channel, 
never interrupt it by an ill-timed jest. — 
12. It is at all times extremely indeli- 
cate to whisper to one's next neighbour: 
this is in some degree a fraud, conver- 
sation being a kind of common proper- 
ty. — 13. In speaking of absent people, 
the infallible iide is, to say no more than 
we should say if they wci-e present. " I 
resolve," said bishop Beveridge, "never 
to speak of a man's virtues to his face, 
nor of his faults behind his back." A

CONVERSIOIS!, a change from one 
state to another. Conversion may be 
J. Merely external, or that which con- 
sists only in an outward reformation. — 
2. Doctrinal, or a change of sentiments. 
— 3. Saving, which consists in the reno- 
vation of the heart and life, or a turn- 
ing from the power of sin and Satan un- 
to God, Acts xxvi. 18. and is produced 
by the influence of Divine grace on the 
soul. — 4. Sometimes it is nut for resto- 
ration, as in the case of Peter, Luke 
xxii. 32. Tl\e instnimental cause of 
conversion is usually the ministry of the 
word ; though sometimes it is produced 
by reading, by serious and appropriate 
conversation, sanctified afflictions, &amp;c. 
"Conversion," says the great Char- 
nock, " is to be distinguislied from re- 
generation thus. — Regeneration is a spi- 
ritual change ; conversion is a spiritual 
motion : in regeneration there is a power 
conferred ; conversion is the exercise 
of this power: in regeneration there is 
given us a principle to turn ; conversion 
is our actual turning. In the covenant, 
God's putting liis Spirit into us is dis- 
tinguished from our walking in his sta- 
tutes from the first stejj we take in the 
way of God, and is set down as the cause 
of our motion, Ezek. xxxvi. 27. In re- 
newing us, God gives us a power; in 
converting us, he excites that power. 
Men are naturally dead, and ha\'e a 
stone upon them : regeneration is a 
rolling away the stone from the heart, 
and a raising to newness of life; and 
then conversion is as natural to a rege- 
nerate man as motion is to a lively body. 
A principle of activity will produce ac- 
tion. In regeneration, man is wholly 
passive ; in conversion, lie k active. 
The first reviving us is wholly the act 
of God, without any concurrence of the 
creature ; but after we are revived we 
do actively and voluntarily live in his 
sight. Regeneration is the motion of 
God in the creature ; conversion is the 
motion of the creature to God, by virtue 
of that first principle : from this prin- 
ciple all the acts of believing, repent- 
ing, mortifying, quickening, do spring. 
In all these a man is active ; in the 
other he is merely passive." Conver- 
sion evidences itself bv ardent love to 
God, Ps. Ixxiii. 25. delight in his peo- 
ple, John xiii. 35. attendance on his or- 
dinances, Ps. xxvii. 4. confidence in his 
promises, Ps. ix. lu. abhorrence of self, 
and renunciation of the world. Job xlii. 
5. James iv. 4. submission to his au- 
thority, and unifonn obedience to his 



word. Matt. vii. 20. See Calling, Rk- 

GKNERATION. 

CONVERT, a person who is con- 
verted. In a monastic sense, converts 
are lay friars, or brothers admitted for 
the service of the house, without orderij, 
and not allowed to sing in the choir. 

CONVICTION, in general, is the as- 
surance of the truth of any proposition. 
In a religious sense, it is the first degree 
of repentance, and implies an affecting 
sense that we are guilty before God; 
that we can do nothing of ourselves to 
gain his forfeited favour; that we de- 
serve and are exposed to the wrath of 
God ; that sin is very odious and hate- 
ful, yea, the greatest of evils. There is 
a natural conviction which arises from 
natural conscience, fear of punishment, 
moral suasion, or alarming pro^'idences., 
but which is not of a permanent nature. 
Saving conviction is the work of the 
Spirit, as the cause ; though the law, 
the conscience, the Gospel, or affliction, 
may be the means, John xvi. 8, 9. Con- 
victions of sin differ very much in their 
degree in different persons. It has been 
observed that those who suffer the most 
agonizing sensations are such as never 
before enjoyed the external call of the 
Gospel, or were not favoured with the 
tuition of religious parents, but have 
neglected or notoriously abused the 
means of grace. To these, conviction 
is often sudden, and produces that hor- 
ror and shame which are not soon over- 
come ; whereas those who have sat 
under the (iospel from their infancy 
have not had such alarming convictions, 
because they have already some notion 
of these things, and have so much ac- 
quaintance with the (iospel as admi- 
nisters immediate comfort. As it i» 
not, therefore, the constant method of 
the Spirit to con\'ince in one way, it is 
improper for any to distress themselves 
because they are not, or have not been 
tormented almost to despair: they 
should be rather thankful that the Spi- 
rit of God has dealt tenderly with them, 
I and opened to them the source of con- 
j solation. It is necessary however to 
j observe, that, in order to repentance and 
; conversion to God, there must be real 
j and lasting conviction, which, though it 
may not be the same in degree, is the 
same in nature. Evangelical conviction 
differs from legal conviction thus: legal 
arises from a consideration of God's jus- 
tice, powei', or omniscience ; evangelical 
from God's goodness and holiness, and 
from a disaffection to sin: legal convic- 
tion still conceits there is some remain- 
ing good; but evangelical is sensible 
! there is no good at all: legal wishes

freedom from pain; evangelical from 
sin: legal hardens the heavt ; evangeli- 
cal softens it : legal is only temporary ; 
evangelical lastine. 

CONVOCATION, an assembly of 
persons for the worship of God, Lev. 
xxiii. Numb, xxviii. Exod. xii. 16. An 
assembly of the clergy for consultation 
upon matters ecclesiastical. 

_ As the parliament consists of tAvo dis- 
tinct houses, so does this convocation. 
The one called the upper house, where 
the archbishops and bishops sit several- 
ly by themselves ; the other the lower 
house, where all the rest of the clergy 
are represented by their deputies. — 
The inferior clergy are represented by 
their proctors; consisting of all the 
deans and archdeacons ; of one proctor 
for every chapter, and two for the 
clergy, of every diocese — in all, one 
hundred and forty-three divines, viz. 
twenty-two deans, fifty-three archdea- 
cons, tv/enty-four prebendaries, and 
forty-four proctors of the diocesan cler- 
i;y. The lower house chooses its pro- 
locutor, who is to take care that the 
members attend, to collect their debates 
and votes, and to carrv their resolutions 
to the upper house. The convocations 
is summoned by the king's writ, directed 
to the archbishop of each province, re- 
quiring him to summon all bishops, 
deans, archdeacons, &amp;c. The power of 
the convocation is limited by a statute 
of Henry VIII. They are not to make 
any canons, or ecclesiastical laws, with- 
out the king's license ; nor, when per- 
mitted, can they put them in execution 
but under several restrictions. — They 
have the examining and censurmg all 
lieretical and schismatical books and 
persons, &amp;c. ; but there lies an appeal 
to the king in chancery, or to his dele- 
gates. The clergy in convocation, and 
their servants, have the same privileges 
as members of parliament. In 1665, the 
convocation of the clergy gave up the 
privilege of taxing themselves to the 
nouse of commons, in consideration of 
their being allowed to vote at the elec- 
tion of members for that liouse. Since 
that period they have been seldom al- 
lowed to do any l&gt;usiness ; and are ge- 
nerally prorogued from time to time till 
dissolved, a new convocation being ge- 
nerally called along with a new parlia- 
ment. 

COPHTI, CoPHT, or Copti, a name 
given to the Christians of Egypt who 
ai-e of the sect of the Jacol&gt;ites. hee Ja- 
cobites. The Cophts have a patri- 
arch, who resides at Cairo ; but he takes 
his title from Alexandria. He has no 
archbishop under him, but eleven or i 



twelve bishops. The rest of the clergy, 
whether secular or regular, are compo- 
sed of the orders of St. Anthony, St. 
Paul, St. Macarius, who have each their 
monasteries. Besides the orders of 
priests, deacons, and sub-deacons, the 
Cophts have, likewise, archimandrites, 
or abbots; the dignity whereof they con- 
fer with all the prayers and ceremonies 
of a strict ordination. By a custom of 
six hundred years standmg, if a priest 
elected bishop be not already archiman- 
drite, that dignity must be conferred on 
him before episcopal ordination. The 
second person among the clergy after 
the patriarch is the titular patriarch of 
Jerusalem, who also resides at Cairo. 
To him belongs the government of the 
Cophtic church during the vacancy of 
the patriarchal see. To be elected pa- 
triarch, it is necessary the person have 
lived all his life in continence. To be 
elected bishop, the person must be in 
the celibate ; or if ne have been mar- 
ried, it must not be above once. The 
priests and inferior ministers are allow- 
ed to be married before ordination ; but 
not forced to it, as some have observed. 
They have a great number of deacons, • 
and even confer the dignity frequently 
on their children. None but the lowest 
rank among the people commence ec- 
clesiastics : whence arises that excessive 
ignorance found among them ; yet the 
respect of the laity towards the clergy 
is very extraordinary. The monastic 
life is m great esteem among them : to 
be admitted into it, there is always re- 
quired the consent of the bishop. The 
religious Cophts, it is said, make a vow 
of perpetual chastity; renounce the 
world, and live with great austerity in 
deserts : they are obliged to sleep in 
their clothes and their girdle, on a mat 
stretched on the ground ; and to pros- 
trate themseh'es every e\'ening one 
hundred and fifty times with their face 
and breast on the ground. They are 
all, both men and women, of the lowest 
class of the people, and live on alms. 
The nunneries are properl)^ hospital's, 
and few enter but widows reduced to 
beggary. 

CORBAN, in Jewish antiquity, were 
those offerings which had life ; in oppo- 
sition to the minchab, or those which 
had not. It is derived from the word 
karab, which signifies, "to approach;" 
because the victims were brought to the 
door of the tabernacle. The corban 
were always looked upon as the most 
sacred offerings. The Jews are I'e- 
proached with defeating, by means of 
the corban, the precept of the fifth com- 
mandment, which enjoins the respect

due to parents ; for when a child had 
no mind to relieve the wants of his fa- 
ther or mother, he would say to them — 
" It is a gift (corban) by whatsoever 
thou mightest be profited by me ;" i. e. 
" I have devoted that to God which you 
ask of me, and it is no longer mine to 
give." Mark vii. 11. 

CORDELIER, a Franciscan, or re- 
ligious of the order of St. Francis. The 
denomination corde/ier, is said to have 
been given in the war of St. Lewis 
against the infidels, wherein the friars 
minor having repulsed the barbarians, 
and that king having enquired their 
name, it was answered, they were peo- 
ple cordcliez, "tied with ropes;" allu- 
ding to the girdle of rope, or cord, tied 
•with three knots, whicn they wore as 
part of their habit. 

CORNARISTS, the disciples of 
Theodore Cornhert, an enthusiastic 
secretary of the states of Holland. He 
wrote, at the same time, against the Ca- 
tholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists. He 
maintained that every religious com- 
munion needed reformation ; but he ad- 
ded, that no person had a right to en- 
^ gage in accomplishing it without a mis- 
sion suppoited by miracles. He was 
also of opinion, that a person might be a 
good Christian without being a member 
of any visiljie church. 

COVENANT, a contract, or agree- 
ment between two or more parties oi 
certain terms. The terms made use 
of in the Scriptures for covenant are 
T\'"\'2 and oiaSrixTi. The former signifies 
c/ioosing; or friendly pailing ; as in co- 
venants each party, in a friendly man- 
ner, consented, and so bound himself to 
the chosen terms ; the latter signifies 
testament, as all the blessings of the co- 
venant ai'e freely disposed to us. The 
word covenant is also used for an im- 
mutable ordinance, Jer. xxxiii. 20. a 
promise, Exod. xxxiv. 10. Is. lix. 21. 
and also for a precept, Jer. xxxiv. 13, 
14. In Scriptui-e we read of various co- 
venants; such as those made with Noah, 
Abraham, and the Hebrews at large. 
Anciently co\enants were made and ra- 
tified with great solemnity. The Scrip- 
tures allude to the cuttmg. of animals 
asunder ; denoting that, in the same 
mrinner, the perjured and covenant- 
breaker should be cut asunder by the 
vengeance of God, Jer. xxxiv. 18. 

Tlie covenants which more especially 
relate to the human race, are generally 
called the covenant of works and the 
covenant of grace. 

The covmant of works is that where- 
by God req I'ves perfect obedience from 
his creatures, in such a manner as to 



make no express provision for the par- 
don of offences, committed against the 
precepts of it on the repentance of such 
offenders, but pronounces a sentence of 
death upon them. Gen. ii. Gal. iv. 24. 
Ps. Ixxxix. 3, '4. The covenant of 
grace is generally defined to be that 
which was made with Christ, as the se- 
cond Adam, and in him with all the elect 
as his seed, Isa. xlii. 1 — 6. 1 Pet. i. 20. 
Is. lii. 13. 

I. The covenant of works was made 
with Adam ; the condition of which was, 
his perseverance during the whole time 
of his probation ; the reward annexed 
to this obedience was the continuance of 
him and his posterity in such perfect ho- 
liness and felicity he then had while upon 
earth, and everlasting life with God 
hereafter. The fienalty threatened for 
the breach of the command was condem- 
nation ; terminating in death temporal, 
spiritual, and eternal. The seals of this 
covenant were, the tree of knowledge 
and the tree of life ; and, perhaps, the 
Sabbath and Paradise, Gen. ii. iii. Gal. 
vi. 24. Rom. v. 12, 19. This covenant 
was broken by Adam's eating of the for- 
bidden fruit, whereby he and his pos- 
terity were all subject to ruin. Gen. iii. 
Rom. V. 12, 19 ; and without the inter- 
vention of the divine grace and mercv, 
would have been lost for ever, Rom. iii. 
23. The Divine Being, foreseeing this, 
in infinite wisdom and unspeakable com- 
passion planned the covenant of grace ; 
by virtue of which his people are rein- 
stated in the blessings of purity, know- 
ledge, and felicity, and that without a 
possibility of any farther defalcation. 

II. The co~venant of grace. Some di- 
vines make a distinction between the co- 
venant of redemption and that of grace ; 
the former, they say, was made with 
Christ in eternity ; the latter with be- 
lievers in time. Others object to this, 
and suppose it a needless distinction ; 
for there is but one covenant of grace, 
and not two, in which the head and 
members are concerned ; and, besides, 
the covenant of gi-ace, proper!}- speak- 
ing, could not be made between God 
and man ; for what can man restipulate 
with God, which is in his power to do 
or give him, and which God has not a 
prior right unto? Fallen man has nei- 
ther inclination to yield obedience, nor 
power to perform it. The parties, there- 
fore,in this covenant,a.ve generally said 
to be the Father and the Son; but 
Dr. Gill supposes that the Holy Ghost 
should not be excluded, since he is 
promised in it, and in consequence of 
it, is sent down into the hearts of be- 
lievers ; and which must be by agree- 



cov 



120 



cov 



intnt, and with his consent. If Ave be- 
lieve, therefore, in a Trinity, it is more 
proper to suppose that tliey were all 
engaged in this plan of the covenant, 
than to suppose that the Father and Son 
were engaged exclusive of the Holy 
Spirit, 1 John v. 6, 7. As to the work of 
the Son, it was the will and appointment 
of the Father that he should take the 
charge and care of his people, John vi. 
39. Heb. ii. 13, redeem them by his 
blood, John xvii. Heb. x. obey the law 
in their room, Rom. x. 4. justify them 
by his righteousness, Dan. ix. 24, Sec, 
and finally, presene them to glon^, Is. 
xl. 11. Jesus Christ, according to the 
divine pui'pose, became the representa- 
tive and covena7it head of his people, 
Eph. i. 22, 23. Col. i. 18. They were 
all considered in him, and represented 
by him, Eph. i. 4. promises of grace and 
glory made to them in him. Tit. i. 2. 

1 Cor. i. 20. he suffered in their stead. 

2 Cor. v. 21. He is also to be considered 
as the mediator of the covenant by whom 
justice is satisfied, and man reconciled to 
God. See art. Mediator. He is also 
the surety of this covenant, Heb. vii. 22. 
as he took the whole del)t upon him, 
freed his people from the charge, obey- 
ed the law, and engaged to bring his 

feople to glon", Heb. ii. 13. Is. xlix. 5, 6. 
le is called the testator of the cove- 
nant, which is denominated a Testa- 
ment, Heb. vii. 22. Heb. ix. 15. He dis- 
poses of his blessings according to his 
will or testament, which is unalterable, 
signed hy his hand, and sealed by his 
blood. In this covenant, as we before 
observed, the Holy Spirit also is enga- 
ged. His assent is given to everj'^ part 
thereof; he l:)rings his people into the 
enjoyment of its blessings, 1 Pet. i. 2. 
2 Thess. ii. 13. He was concerned in the 
incarnation of Christ, Matt. i. 18. and 
assisted his human nature, Heb. ix. 14. 
lie takes of the things of Christ, and 
shows them unto us ; cleanses, enlight- 
ens, sanctifies, establishes, and comforts 
his people, according to the plan of the 
covenant, Rom. viii. 15, 16. See Holy 
Ghost. 

III. Tlie projierties of this covenant 
are such as these: 1. It "is eternal, being 
made before time, Eph. i. 3, 4. 2 Tim. i. 
9. — 2. Divine as to its origin, springing 
entirely from free grace, Rom. xi. 5, 6. 
Ps. Ixxxix. 2, 3, 28.-3. It is absolute 
and unconditional, Eph. ii. 8, 9. — 4. It 
is perfect and complete, wanting no- 
thing, 2 Sam. xxiii. 5. — 5. It is sure and 
immoveable, Isa. liv. 10. Isa. Iv. 3. — 6. 
Called nevN' in opposition to the old, and 
as its blessings will be ahvays new, Heb. 
riii. 6, 8. i! 



IV. These two covenants adovc-mcn- 
tioned aj^ree in some thing's, in others 
they dijfn: 1. "In both," says Witsius, 
"the parties concerned are' God and 
man. — 2. In both, the same promise of 
eternal life. — 3. The condition of both is 
the same, perfect obedience to the law 
prescribed ; for it is not worthy of God 
to admit man to a blessed communion 
with him but in the way of holiness. — 
4. In both is tlie same end, the gloiy of 
God. But they differ in the following 
respects : 1. In the covenant of works, 
the character or relation of God is that 
of a supreme lawgiver, and the chief 
good rejoicing to communicate happi- 
niess to his creatures. In the covenant 
of grace he appears as infinitely merci- 
ful, adjudging life to the elect sinner, 
agreeably to his wisdom and justice. — 2. 
In the covenant of wcrks there was no 
mediator : the coA'enant of gi-ace has a 
mediator, Christ. — 3. In the covenant 
of works, the condition of perfect obe- 
dience was required to be performed by 
man himself in covenant. In the cove- 
nant of grace the same condition is pro- 
posed, but to be performed by a media- 
tor. — 4. In the covenant of works man is 
considered as working, and the reward 
as to be given of debt. In the covenant 
of grace the man in covenant is consi- 
dered as believing; eternal life being 
giVen as the merit of the mediator, out 
of free grace, which excludes all boast- 
ing. — 5. In the covenant of works some- 
thmg is required as a conchtion, which 
being performed entitles to reward. The 
covenant of grace consists not of condi- 
tions, but of promises : the life to be 
obtained ; faith, by which we are made 
partakers of Christ; perseverance, and, 
in a word, the whole of salvation, are 
absolutely promised. — 6. The special 
end of the covenant of works was the 
manifestation of the holiness, goodness, 
and justice of God ; but the special end 
of the covenant of grace, is the praise 
of the glory of his grace, and the reve- 
lation of his unsearchable and manifold 
wisdom." — 7. The covenant of works 
was only for a time, but the covenant of 
grace stands sure for ever. 

V. The administration of the covenant 
of grace. — The covenant of grace, under 
tlie Old Testament, was exhibited by 
promises, sacrifices, types, ordinances, 
and prophecies. Under the New it is 
administered in liie preaching of the 
Gospel, baptism, and the Lord's sup- 

Eer ; in which gi-acc and salvation are 
eld fortli in more fulness, evidence, and 
efficacy to all nations, 2 Cor. iii. 6 — 18. 
Heb. viii. Matt, xxviii. 19, 20. But in 
both periods, the mediator, the wholr 



GOV 



121 



cou 



substance, blessings, and mannei;' of ob- 
taining an interest therein by faith, are 
the very same, without anv difference, 
Heb. XI. 6. Gal. iii. 7, 14. The reader, 
who may wish to have a more enlar.^ed 
view of this subject, may peruse Jlll- 
shcs, StJ'ong, or Boston o?i the Cove- 
?iants, in the former of which especially 
he will find tlie subject masterly hand- 
led. 

Covenant, in ecclesiastical history, 
denotes a contract or convention agreed 
to by the Scotch, in the year 1638, for 
maintaining tlieir religion free from in- 
novation. In 1581, the gcnei'al assembly 
of Scotland drew up a confession of 
faith, or national covenant, condemning 
episcopal government, under the name 
of hierarchy ,\\\\\&lt;:\\ was signed l)y James 
I. and which he enjoined on all his sub- 
jects. It was again subscribed in 1590 
and 1596. The subscription was re- 
newed in 1638, and the subscribers en- 
gaged l)y oath to maintain religion in 
the same state as it was in 1580, and to 
reject all innoA^ations inti-odiiced since 
that time. Tliis oath, annexed to the 
confession of faith, received the name 
of Co-venant, as those who subscribed 
it were called Covenmiters. 

Solemn Icas^ne and co~venant, was es- 
tablished in the year 1643, and formed 
a bond of union between Scotland and 
England. It was sworn to and subscribed 
by many in both nations ; who hereby 
solemnly abjured popery and prelacy, 
and combined together for their mutual 
defence. It was approved by the par- 
liament and assembly at Westminster, 
and ratified by the general assembly of 
Scotland in 1645. King Charles I. dis- 
appro\'ed of it when he surrendered 
himself to the Scots army in 1646 ; but, 
in 1650, Charles II. declared his appro- 
bation both of this and the national co- 
venant by a solemn oath ; and, in Au- 
gust of the same year, made a farther 
declaration at Dunfermline to the same 
purpose, which was also renewed on oc- 
casion of his coronation at Scone, in 1651. 
The covenant was ratified by parlia- 
ment in this year ; and the subscription 
of it was required by every member, 
without which, the constitution of the 

fiarliament was declared null and void, 
t produced a series of distractiojis in 
the subsequent history of that country, 
and was voted illegal by parliament, and 
provision made against it. Stat. 14. Car.

' COVETOUSNESS, an unreasonable 
desire after that we have not, with a 
dissatisfaction with what we have. It 
may farther be considered as consisting 
in, 1. An anxious cai-king care about 



the things of this world. — 2. A rapacity 
in getting. — 3. Too frequently includes 
sinister and illegal wa\s of obtaining 
wealth.-— 4. A tenacious'ness in keeping. 
It is a vice which marvellously prevails 
upon and insinuates into the heart of 
man, and for these reasons : it often 
bears a near resemblance to virtue ; 
brings with it many plausible reasons ; 
and raises a man to a state of reputation 
on account of his riches. " There can- 
not be," as one oljserves, " a more un- 
reasonable sin than this. It is unjust ; 
only to covet, is to wish to be unjust. 
It is cruel : the covetous must harden 
themselves against a thousand plaintive 
voices. It is ungrateful : such forget 
their former obligations and their pre- 
j sent supporters. It is fooli.sh : it de- 
stroys reputiOiton, breaks the rest, un- 
fits tor the pbrformance of duty, and is 
a contempt of God himself : it is unpre- 
cedented in all our examples of virtue 
mentioned in the Scripture. One, in- 
deed, spoke unadvisedly with his lips ; 
another cursed and swore ; a third was 
in a passion ; and a fourth committed 
adultery ; but which of the saints ever 
lived in a habit of covetousness ? Lastly, 
it is idolatry. Col. iii. 5. the idolatry of 
the heart ; where, as in a temple, the 
miserable wretch excludes God, sets 
up gold instead of him, and places that 
confidence in it which belongs to the 
Great Supreme alone." Let those who 
live in the habitual practice of it con- 
sider the judgments that have been in- 
flicted on such characters. Josh. vii. 21: 
Acts V. ; the misery with which it is at- 
tended; the curse such persons are to 
society ; the denunciations and cautions 
respecting it in the Holy Scripture ; 
and how effectually it bars men from 
God, from happiness, and from heaven.

under the reign and by the command of 
Theodosius the Great, for much the 
same end that the former council was 
summoned. — 3. The council of Ephesus, 
convened by Theodosius the Younger, 
at the suit of Nestorius. — 4. The coun- 
cil at Chalcedon, held in the reign of 
Martianus, which approved of the Eu- 
Lychian heresy. — 5. The second council 
of Constantinople, assembled by the 
emperor Justinian, condemned the three 
chapters taken out of the book of Theo- 
dorus, of Mopsuestia, having first de- 
cided that it was lawful to anathematize 
the dead. Some authors tell us that 
they likewise condemned the several 
errors of Origen about tF ^ Trinity, the 
plurality of worlds, andi &gt;re-existence 
of souls. — 6. The third ci«^mcil of Con- 
stantinople, held by the command of 
Constantius Pogonatus, the em]ieror, in 
which they received the definitions of 
the first five general councils, and parti- 
cularly that against Origen and Theo- 
doras, of Mopsuestia. — 7. The second 
Nicene council. — 8. The fourth council 
of Constantinople, assembled when 
Louis II. was empei-or of the West. 
Their regulations are contained in 
twentv-seven canons, tlie heads of which 
the reader may find in Dupin. ^Vhat- 
evcr may be said in favour of general 
councils, their utility has been doubted 
by some of the wisest men. Dr. Jortin 
says, " they have been too much extol- 
led by Papists, and by some Protestants. 
They were a collection of men who 
were frail and fallible. Some of those 
councils were not assemblies of pious 
and learned dix'ines, but cabals, the ma- 
jority of which were quarrelsome, fana- 
tical, domineering, dishonest prelates, 
who wanted to compel men to approve 
all their opinion.s, of which they them- 
selves had no clear conceptions, and to 
anathematize and oppress those who 
would not implicitly submit to their de- 
terminations. Jortin' s Works, vol. vii.

sheim's Eccl. HiM. Index. 

Councils, Provincial or Occasional, 
have been numerous. At Aix la Cha- 
pelle, A. D. 816, a council was held for 
regulating the canons of cathedral chur- 
ches. The council of Savonnieries, in 
859, was the first which gave the title 
of Most Christian King to the king of 
France ; but it did not become the pe- 
culiar appellation of that sovereign till 
1469. Of Troyes, in 887, to decide the 
disputes about the imperial dignity. 
The second council of Troyes, 1107, 
restrains the clergy from marrying. 



The council of Clermont, in 1095. The 
fii'st crusade was determined in this 
council. The bishops had yet the pre- 
cedency of cardinals. In this assembly 
the name of Pope was for the first time 
given to the head of the church, exclu- 
sively of the bishops, who used to as- 
sume that title. Here, also, Hugh, 
archliisliop of Lyons, obtained of the 
pope a confirmation of the primacy of 
his see over that of Sens. The council 
of Rheims, summoned by Eugenius III. 
in 1148, called an assembly of Cisastriau 
Gaul, in which advowses, or patrons of 
churches, are prohibited taking more 
than ancient fees, upon pain of depriva- 
tion and ecclesiastical burial. Bishops, 
deacons, sub-deacons, monks, and nuns, 
are restrained from maiTyhig. In this 
council the doctrine of the Trinity was 
decided : but upon separation the pope 
called a congregation, in which the car- 
dinals pi-etcnded they had no ri^-ht to 
judge of doctrinal points ; that this was 
the privilege peculiar to the ])ope. The 
council of Sutrium, in 1046, wherein 
three popes who had assumed the cliair 
were deposed. The council of Claren- 
don in England, against Becket, held in 
1164. The council of Lombez, in the 
country of Albigeois, in 1200, occasion- 
ed by some disturbances on account of 
the .\lbigensis ; a crusade M^as formed 
on this account, and an army sent to 
extii-pate them. Innocent III. spirited 
up this barbarous war. Domiinc was 
the apostle, the count of Toulouse the 
victim, and Simon, count of Montfoi-t, 
the conductor or chief. Tlie council of 
Paris in 1210, in which Aristotle's 
metaphysics were condemned to the 
flames, lest the refinements of that phi- 
losopher should have a bad tendency 
on men's minds, by applying tliose sub- 
jects to religion. The council of Pisa, 
begun March the 2d, 1409, in which 
Benedict XIII. and Gregory XII. were 
deposed. z\nother council, sometimes 
called general, held at Pisa in 1505. 
Lewis XII. of France, assembled a na- 
tional council at Tours (being highly 
disgusted with the pope,) 1510, where 
was present the cardinal De Gurce, de- 
puted by the emperor ; and it was then 
agreed to convene a general council at 
Pisa. Murray's History of Heligioyi.

COURAGE is that quality of the 
mind that enables men to encounter dif- 
ficulties and dangers. Alitural courage 
is that which arises chiefly from consti- 
tution ; moral or spiritual is that which 
is produced from principle, or a sense 
of dutv. Courage and Fortitude arc 
often used as synonymous, but they may 



CRE 



123 



CRE 



be distinguished thus: fortitude is firm- 
ness of mind that supjjorts paiu ; cou- 
rage is active fortitude, tliat meets dan- 
gers, and attempts to I'cpel them. See 
Fortitude. 

Courage, saj^s Addison, that grows 
from constitution, very often forsakes a 
man when he has occasion for it ; and 
when it is onl)' a kind of instinct in the 
soul, it breaks' out on all occasions, with- 
out judgment or discretion ; but that 
courage which arises from a sense of 
duty, and from a fear of offending Him 
that made us, always acts in an uniform 
manner, and according to the dictates 
of right reason. 

CREATION, in its primaiy import, 
signifies the bringing into bemg some- 
thing which did not before exist. The 
term is therefore most generally appli- 
ed to the original production of the ma- 
terials whereof the visible world is com- 
posed. It is also used in a secondary or 
subordinate sense to denote those sub- 
sequent operations of the Deity upon 
the matter so produced, by which the 
whole system of Nature, and all the 
primitive genera of things, receive their 
form, qualities, and laws. 

There is no subject concerning which 
learned men have differed in tlieir con- 
jectures more than in this of creation. 
" It is certain," as a good writer ob- 
serves, " that none of the ancient philo- 
sophers had the smallest idea of its be- 
ing possible to produce a substance out 
of nothing, or that even the power of 
the Deity himself could work without 
any materials to work upon. Hence 
some of them, among whom was Aris- 
totle, asserted that the world was eter- 
nal, both as to its matter and form. 
Others, though they believed that the 
gods had given the world its form, yet 
imagined the materials whereof it is 
composed to have been eternal. 'In- 
deed, the opinions of the ancients, who 
had not the benefit of revelation, were 
on this head so confused and contradic- 
tory, that nothing of any consequence 
can be deduced from them. The free- 
thinkers of our own and of foriper ages 
have denied the possibility of creation, 
as being a contradiction to reason ; and 
of consequence have taken the oppor- 
tunity from thence to discredit revela- 
tion. On the other hand, many defend- 
ers of the sacred writings have assert- 
ed that creation out of nothing, so far 
from being a contradiction to reason, is 
not only probable, but demon sti-alilv 
certain. Nay, some have gone so far as 
to say, that from the very inspection of 
the visible system of Nature, we ai-e 
able to infer that it was once in a state 



of non-existence." We cannot, how- 
e\er, here enter into the multiplicity of 
the arguments on both sides ; it is enough 
for us to know what God has been 
pleased to reveal, botli conceiTiing him- 
self and the works of his hands. " Men, 
and other animals that inhabit the earth 
and the seas ; all the immense varieties 
of berths and plants of which the vege- 
table kingdom consists ; the globe of the 
earth, and the expanse of the ocean ; 
these we know to ha\'e been produced 
by his power. Besides the terrestrial 
world, Avhich we inhabit, we see many 
other material bodies disposed around 
it in the wide* extent of space. The 
moon, which is in a particular manner 
connected with our earth, and even de- 
pendent upon it ; the sun, and the other 
planets, with their satellites, which like 
the earth circulate round the sun, and 
appear to derive from him light and 
heat ; those bodies which we call fixed 
stars, and consider as illuminating and 
cherishing with heat each its peculiar 
system of planets; and the comets which 
at certain periods surprise us with their 
appearance, and the nature of whose 
connection witli the general system of 
Nature, or with any particular system 
of planets, we cannot pi-etend to have 
fully discovered ; these are so many 
more of the Deity's works, from the 
contemplation of which we cannot but 
conceive the most awful ideas of his 
creative power. 

" Matter, however, whatever the va- 
rieties of form under which it is made 
to appear, the relative disposition of its 
parts, or the motions communicated to 
it, is but an inferior part of the works of 
creation. We believe ourselves to be 
animated with a much higher principle 
than brute matter ; in viewing the man- 
ners and economy of the lower ani- 
mals, we can scarce avoid acknowledg- 
ing even them to consist of something 
more than various modifications of mat- 
ter and motion. The other planetary 
bodies, which seem to be in circumstan- 
ces nearly analogous to those of our 
earth, are surely, as well as it, destined 
for the habitations of rationrd intelligent 
beings. The existence of intelligences 
of an higher order than man, though ui- 
finitely below the Deity, appears ex- 
tremely probable. Of these spiritual 
beings, called angels, we have express 
intimation in Scripture (see the article 
Angel.) But the limits of the creation 
we must not pretend to define. How 
far the regions of space extend, or how 
they are filled, we know not. How the 
planetary woi-lds, the sun, and the fixed 
stars are occupied, we do not pretend 



CRE 



124 



CRE 



to have ascertained. "N^'e arc even ig- 
norant how wide a diversity of forms, 
what an infinity of living animated be- 
ings may inhabit our bv/n globe. So 
confined is our knowledge of creation, 
yet so grand, so awful, that part which 
our narrow understandings can com- 
prehend ! 

" Conceraing the periods of time at 
which the Deity executed his several 
works, it cannot be pretended that man- 
kind have had opportunities of receiv- 
ing very particular information. Many 
have been the conjectures, and curious 
the fancies of learned, men, respecting 
it ; but, after all, we must be indebted 
to the sacred writings for the best infor- 
mation." Different copies, indeed, give 
different dates. The Hebrew copy of 
the Bible, which we Christians, for good 
reasons, considej' as the most authentic, 
dates the creation of the world 3944 
years before the Christian era. The 
Samaritan Bible, again, fixes the era of 
the creation 4305 years before the birth 
of Christ. And the Greek translation, 
known by the name of the Septuagint 
version oV the Bible, gives 5270 as the 
number of the years which intervened 
between these two periods. By com- 
paring the various dates in the sacred 
writings, examining how these have 
come to disagree, and to be diversified 
in different copies ; endeavouring to re- 
concile t!ie most authentic profane with 
sacred chronology, some ingenious men 
liave formed schemes of chronology 
plausible, indeed, but not supported by 
sufficient authorities, which they would 
gladly persuade us to receive in pre- 
ference to any of those above-mention- 
ed. Usher makes out from the Hebrew 
Bible 4004 years as the term between 
the creation and the birth of Christ. 
Josephus, according to Dr. Wills, and 
Mr. XVhiston, makes it 4658 years; and 
M. Pezron, with the help of the Sep- 
tuagint, extends it to 5872 years. Ush- 
er's svstem is the most generally receiv- 
ed. But though these different systems 
of chronolog}' are so inconsistent, and 
so slenderly supported, yet the differ- 
ences among them are so inconsider- 
able, in comparison with those which 
arise before us when we contemplate 
the chronology of the Chinese, the 
Chaldeans, and the Egyptians, and they 
agree so well with the general informa- 
tion of authentic history, and with the 
appearances of nature and of society, 
that they may be considered as nearlv 
fixing the tnie period of the creation of 
the earth." Uncertain, however, as we 
may be as to the exact time of the crea- 
tion, we may profitably apply cui'selves |{ 



to the contemplation of this immense 
fabric. Indeed, the beautiful and raul- 
tifonn works around us must strike the 
mind of every beholder Avith wonder 
and admiration, unless he be enveloped 
in ignorance, and chained doAvn to the 
earth with sensuality. These works 
every way proclaim the wisdom, the 
[ power, and tlie goodness of the Creator. 
I Creation is a book which the nicest 
philosopher may study with the deepest 
' attention. Unlike the works of art, the 
! more it is examined, the more it opens 
i to us sources of admiration of its great 
Author ; the more it calls for our in- 
I spection, and the more it demands our 
I praise. Here every thing is adjusted in 
I the exactest order ; all answering the 
wisest ends, and acting according to the 
I appointed laws of Deity. Here the 
i Christian is led into the most delightful 
' field of contemplation. To him every 
i pebble becomes a preacher, and every 
atom a step by which he ascends to his 
I Creator. Placed in this beautifiil tem- 
ple, and looking around on all its \'ari- 
ous parts, he cannot help joining with 
the Psalmist in saying, "O Lord, how 
manifold are thy works ; in wisdom hast 
thou made them all !" See Eternity 
of God.

CREDULITY, the belief of any pro- 
position without sufficient evidence of 
Its truth. 

CREED, a form of words in which 
the articles of faith are comprehended. 
See Confession. 

The most ancient form of creeds is 
that which goes under the name of the 
Apostles' Creed (see below ;) besides 
this, there are se\eral other ancient 
forms and scattered remains of creeds 
to be met with in the ])rimitive records 
of the church ; as, 1. The form of apos- 
tolical doctrine collected by Origen. — 
2. A fragment of a creed preserved by 
Tertullian. — 3. A remnant of a creed in 
the works of C)-prian. — 4. A creed com- 
posed by Gregory Thaumaturg\is for 
the use of his own church. — 5. The creed 
of Lucian, the martyr. — 6. The creed 
of the apostolical constitutions. Besides 
these scattered remains of the ancient 
creetls, there are extant some perfect 
forms, as those of Jerusalem, Cesarea, 
Antioch, &amp;c. 

CREED, APOSTLES', is a formula 
or summary of the Christian faith, 
drawn up, according to Ruffinus, by the 



CRE 



125 



CRI 



apostles themselves ; who, during their 
stay at Jerasaleni, soon after our Lord's 
ascension, agreed upon this creed as a 
rule of faith. Baronius and others con- 
iecture that they did r.ot compose it 
till the second year of Claudius, a little 
before their dispersion ; but there are 
many I'easons which induce us to ques- 
tion whether the apostles composed 
any such creed. For, 1. Neither St. 
Luke, nor any other wi-iter before the 
fifth century, make any mention of an 
assembly of the apostles for composing a 
creed. — 2. The fathers of the first three 
centuries, in disputing against the here- 
tics, endeavour to prove that the doc- 
trine contained in this creed was the 
same which the apostles taught ; but 
tliey never pretend that the apostles 
composed it. — 3. If the apostles had 
made this creed, it would have been 
the same in all cliurches and in all ages ; 
and all authors would have cited it af- 
ter the same manner. But the case is 
quite otherwise. In the second and 
third ages of the church there were as 
many creeds as authors ; and the same 
authors sets down the creed after a dif- 
ferent manner in several places of his 
works ; which is an evidence, that there 
was not, at that time, any creed reputed 
to be the apostles'. In the fourth cen- 
tury, Ruffinus compares together the 
three, ancient creeds of the churches of 
Aquileia, Rome, and the East, which 
diner very considerably. Besides, these 
creeds differed not only in the terms 
and expressions, but even in the articles, 
some of which were omitted in one or 
other of them ; such as those of the de- 
sce?it into hell, the cominnnion of the 
snmts, and the life everlasting. From 
all which it may be gathered, that 
though this creed may be said to be 
that of the apostles, in regard to the 
doctrines contained therein," yet it can- 
not be referred to them as the authors 
of it. Its great antiquity, however, may 
be inferred from hence, that the whole 
form, as it now stands in the English 
liturgy, is to be found in the works of 
St. Ambrose and Ruffinus ; the former 
of whom flourished in the third, and the 
latter in the fourth century. The 
primitive Christians did not publicly 
recite the creed, except at baptisms, 
which, unless in cases of necessity, were 
only at Easter and Whitsuntide'. The 
constant repeating of it was not intro- 
duced into the church till the end of the 
fifth century ; about which time Peter 
Gnaphius, bishop of Antioch, prescribed 
the recital of it every time divine ser- 
vice was performed. See King's His- 
tory of the J/iostles' Creed j and Bar- 



roTj's Exposition of it in his Works, 

CREED, ATH AN ASIAN, a formu- 
lary or confession of faith, long sup- 
posed to have been drawn up by Atha- 
nasius, bishop of Alexandria,' m the 
fourth century, to justify himself against 
the calumnies of his Arian enemies ; 
but it is now generally allowed not to 
have been his. Dr. Waterland ascribes 
it to Hilary, bishop of Aries. This 
creed obtained in France about A. D. 
850, and was received in Spain and 
Germany about 180 years later. As to 
our own'countiy, we have clear proofs 
of its being sung alternately in our 
churches in the tenth centuiy. It was 
in. common use in some parts of Italy in 
960, and was received at Rome about 
1014. As to the Greek and Oriental 
churches, it has been questioned 
whether they have ever received it, 
though some writers are of a contrary 
persuasion. The episcopal chufches of 
America have rejected it. As to the 
matter of it, it is given as a summary of 
the true orthodox faith. Unhappily, 
however, it has proved a fruitful source 
of unjjrofitable controversy. See Dr. 
IVaterland's Critical History of it. 

CREED, NICENE, a formulaiy of 
Christian faith ; so called, because it is 
a paraphrase of that creed which was 
made at the first general council of 
Nice. This latter was drawn up by the 
second general council of Constantino- 
ple, A. D. 381 : and therefore might be 
more properly styled the Constantino- 
politan creed. The creed was carried 
by a majority, and admitted into the 
church as a barrier against Arius and 
his followers. 

The three creeds above-mentioned are 
used in the public offices of the church 
of England ; and subscription to them is 
required of all the established clergy. 
Subscription to these was also required 
of the dissenting teachers by the tolei'a- 
tion act ; but from which they are now 
relieved by 19 Geo. III. 

CRIME, a voluntary breach of any 
known law. Faults result from human 
weakness, being transgressions of the 
rules of duty. Crimes proceed from the 
wickedness of the heart, being actions 
against the rules of nature. See Pun- 
ishment and Sin. 

CRISPITES, those who adopt the 
sentiments of Dr. Crisp, a divine of the 
seventeenth centuiy. He was fond, it 
is said, of expressions which alarm, and 
paradoxes which astonish ; and per- 
plexed himself much about the divine 
purposes. He did not distinguish as he 
ought, between God's secret will in his 



CRO 



126 



CRO 



decrees, and his rcA^ealed will in his co- 
venant and promises. Tlie root of his 
error seems to be this : — he viewed the 
union between Christ and the behever 
to be of such a kind as actually to make 
a Sa^ iour of the sinner, and a sinner of 
the Saviour. He speaks as if God con- 
sidered the sinner as doing and suffering 
what Christ did and sufiered; and Christ 
as having committed their sins, and as 
being actually guilty of them. See book 
under articles Anti'nomians and Neo- 
NOMIANS. Cris/i's Sermons, edited by 
JDr. Gill ; Bogue and Bennei's History 
of Dissenters, vol. i. p. 400. 

CROISADE, cr Crusade, may be 
applied to any war undertaken on pre- 
tence of defending the cause of religion, 
but has been chiefly used for the expe- 
ditions of the Christians against the 
infidels for the conquest of Palestine. 

These expeditions commenced A. D. 
3096. The foundatiDn of them was a 
superstitious veneration for those places 
■whei'e our Sa\iour jjerformed his mi- 
racles, and accomplished the work of 
man's redemption. Jerusalem had been 
taken and Palestine conquered by 
Omar. This proved a considerable in- 
terruption to the pilgrims, who flocked 
from all quarters to perform their de- 
votions at the holy sepulchre. The)' 
had, however, still been allowed this 
liberty, on paying a small tribute to the 
Saracen caliphs, who were not much 
inclined to molest them. But, in 1064, 
this city changed its masters. The 
Turks took it trom the Saracens ; and 
being much more fierce and barbarous, 
the pilgrims now found they could no 
longer perform their devotions with the 
same safety. An opinion was about this 
time also pre\'alent in Europe, which 
made these pilgrimages much more 
frequent than formerly : it was ima- 
cined, that the 1000 vears mentioned in 
Rev. XX. were fulfilled ; that Christ was 
soon to make his appearance in Pales- 
tine to judge the world; and conse- 
quently that Jouraeys to that country 
were in the highest degree meritorious, 
and even absolutely necessary. The 
multitudes of pilgvims who now flocked 
to Palestine meeting with a very- rough 
reception from the Turks, filled all 
Europe with, complain.ts against those 
infidels, who profaned the liolv citv, and 
derided the sacred mysteries 'of Chris- 
tianity e\ren in the place where they 
were fiilfiUed. Pope Gregory VII. had 
formed a design of uniting all the 
princes of Christendom against the Ma- 
hometans ; but his exorbitant encroach- 
ments upon the civil power of princes 
had created him so many enemies, and 



rendered his schemes so suspicious, that 
he was not able to make great progi-ess 
in his undertaking. The work was re- 
served for a meaner instrument. Peter, 
commonly called the Hermit, a native 
of Amiens in Picardy, had made the 
pilgrimage to Jenisalem ; and being 
deeply affected with the dangers to 
which that act of piety now exposed 
the pilgrims, as well as with the op- 
pression under which the eastern Chris- 
tians noAv laboured, formed the bold, 
and, in all appearance, impracticable 
design of leading into Asia, from the 
farthest extremities of the West, armies 
suflScient to subdue those potent and 
warlike nations that now held the holy 
land in slavery. He proposed his scheme 
to pope Martin II. who, prudently re- 
solving not to intei'pose his authoiity 
tUl he saw a probability of success, sum- 
moned at Placentia a council of 4000 
ecclesiastics and 30,000 seculars. As 
no hall could be found large enough to 
contain such a multitude, the assembly 
j was held in a plain. Here the pope 
] himself, as well as Peter, harangued the 
people, representing the dismal situa- 
I tion of their brethren in the Eiist, and 
j the indignity offered to the Christian 
name in allowing the holy city to re- 
main in the hands of the infidels. These 
speeches were so agreeable to those 
who heai'd them, that the whole multi- 
tude suddenly and violently declared 
for the war, and solemnly devoted 
themselves to perform this service, 
which they believed to be meritorious 
in the sight of God. But though It:dy 
seemed to have embraced the design 
with ardour, Martin thought it neces- 
sary, in order to obtain perfect success, 
to engage the greater and more warlike 
nations m the same enterprise. Having, 
therefore exhorted Peter to visit the 
chief cities and sovereigns of Christen- 
dom, he summoned another council at 
Clermont in Auvergne. The fame of 
this great and pious design being now 
universally diffused, procured the at- 
tendance of the greatest prelates, nobles, 
and princes ; and when the pope and 
the hermit renewed their pathetic ex- 
hortations, the whole assembly, as if 
impelled by immediate inspiration, ex- 
claimed with one voice, " It is the will 
of God !" These words were deemed 
so much the effect of a divine impulse, 
that they were employed as the signal 
of rendezvous and battle in all future 
exploits of these adventurers. Men of 
all ranks now flew to arms with the 
utmost ardour, and a cross was afiixed 
to their right shoulder by all who enlist- 
ed in this holy entei-prise. At this time

Eai'ope was sunk in the most profound 
ignorance and superstition. The eccle- 
siastics had gained tlie greatest ascend- 
ant over the human mind ; and the peo- 
ple who committed the most horrid 
ci-imes and disorders, knew of no other 
expiation than the observances imposed 
on them by their spiritiud pastors. But 
amidst the abject superstition which 
now prevailed, the militai-y spirit had 
also universall}^ difiused itself; and, 
though not supported by art or disci- 
pline, was become the general passion 
of the nations governed b}' the feudal 
law. All the great lords possessed tlie 
right of peace and war. They were 
engaged in continual hostilities witli one 
another : the open country was become 
a scene of outrage and disorder : the 
cities, still mean and poor, were neither 
guarded by walls nor protected by pri- 
vileges. Every man was obliged to de- 
pend for safety on his own force, or his 
private alliances ; and valour was the 
only excellence which was held in es- 
teem, or gave one man the pre-eminence 
above another. When all the particular 
superstitions, therefoi'c, were here uni- 
ted in one great object, the ardour for 
])rivate hostilities took the same direc- 
tion ; " and all Europe," as the princess 
Anna Comnena expresses it, " torn from 
its foundations, seemed ready to pre- 
cipitate itself in one united body upon 
Asia." 

All ranks of men now deeming the 
croisades the onlv road to heaven, were 
impatient to open the wav with their 
swords to the holy citj-. Nobles, arti- 
zans, peasants, even priests, enrolled 
their names ; and to decline this service 
was branded with the reproach of im- 
piety or cowardice. The nobles were 
moved, by the romantic spirit of the 
age, to hope for opulent establishments 
in the East, the chief seat of arts and 
commerce at that time. In pursuit of 
these chimerical projects, they sold at 
low prices their ancient castles and in- 
heritances, which had now lost all value 
in their eyes. The infirm and aged con- 
tributed to the expedition by presents 
and money, and many of them attended 
it in person ; being determined, if possi- 
ble to breathe their last in sight ot that 
city where their Saviour died for them. 
Even women, concealing their sex un- 
der the disguise of armour, attended the 
camp ; and often forgot their duty still 
more, by prostituting themselves to the 
army. The greatest criminals were for- 
ward in a service which they consider- 
ed as an expiation for all crimes ; and 
the most enormous disorders were, du- 
ring the course of these expeditions, 



committed by men inured to wicked- 
ness, encouraged by example, and im- 
pelled by necessity. The adventurei"s 
were at last so numerous, that their sa- 
gacious leaders became apprehensive 
lest the greatness of the armament 
would be the cause of its own disap- 
pointment. For this reason they per- 
mitted an undisciplined multitude, com- 
puted at 300,000 men, to go before them 
under the command of Peter the her- 
mit, and Gautier or V\'alter, surnamed 
the moneyless, from his being a soldier 
of fortune. I'hese took the road towards 
Constantinople through Hungary and 
Bulgaria; and trusting that heaven, by 
supernatural assistance, would supply 
all their necessities, they made no pro- 
vision for subsistence in their march. 
They soon found themselves obliged to 
obtain by plunder what they vainly ex- 
pected from miracles : and the enraged 
mhabitants of the countries through 
which the}- passed attacked the disor- 
derly multitude, and slaughtered them 
without i-esistance. The more disciplined 
armies followed after ; and, passing the 
straits of Constantinople, were muster- 
ed in the plains of Asia, and amounted 
in tlie whole to 700,000 men. The 
princes engaged in this first crusade 
were, Hugo, count of Vermandois, bixi- 
ther to Philip I. king of Fi-ance ; Ro- 
bert, duke ot Normandy ; Robert, earl 
of Flanders ; Raimond, earl of Toulouse 
and St. Giles ; the celebrated Godfrey 
of Bouillon, duke of Lorrain, with his 
brothers Baldwin and Eustace ; Ste- 
phen, earl of Chartres and Blois ; Hugo, 
count of St. Paul ; with many other 
lords. The general rendezvous was at 
Constantinople. In this expedition, God- 
frey besieged and took the city of Nice. 
Jerusalem was taken by the confede- 
rated army, and Godfrey chosen king. 
The Christians gained the famous bat- 
tle of Ascalon against the Sultan of 
Egypt, which put an end to the first 
crusade, but not to the spirit of cru- 
sading. The rage continued for near two 
centuries. The second crusade, in 1144, 
was headed by the emperor Conrad HI. 
and Louis VII. king of France. The 
emperor's army was either destroyed 
by the enemy, or perished through the 
treachery of Manuel, the Greek empe- 
ror ; and the second army, through the 
unfaithfulness of the Christians of Syria, 
was forced to break up the siege of Da- 
mascus. The third crusade, in 1188, im- 
mediately followed the taking of Jeru- 
salem by Saladin, the Sultan of Egypt. 
The princes engaged in this expedition 
were, the emperor Frederic Barbaros- 
sa ; Frederic, duke of Suabia, his second

son ; Leopold, duke of Austria ; Ber- 
thold, duke of Moravia ; Herman, mar- 
qiiis of Baden ; the counts of Nassau, 
Tliuringia, Missen, and Holland; and 
above sixty other princes of the em- 
pire ; with the bishops of Besangon, 
Cambrav, Munster, Osnaburg, Missen, 
Passau, Visburg, and several others. In 
this expedition the emperor Frederic 
defeated the Sultan of Iconium : his son 
Frederic, joined by Guy Lusignon, king 
of Jerusalem, in vain endeavoured to 
take Acre or Ptolcmais. During these 
transactions, Philip Augustus, king of 
France, and Richard I. king of England, 
joined the ci'oisade : by wiiich means 
the Christian army consisted of 300,000 
fighting men; but great disputes hap- 
pening Ijetween the kings of France and 
England, the former quitted the holy 
land, and Richard concluded a peace 
Avith Saladin. The fourth croisade was 
undertaken in 1195, by the eniperor 
Henry VI. after Saladin's death. In this 
expedition the Cliristians gained several 
battles against the infidels, took a great 
many towns, and were in the way of 
success, when the death of the emperor 
obliged them to quit the holv land, and 
return into Germany. The fifth croisade 
was published by pope Innocent III. in 
1198. Those engaged in it made fruit- 
less efforts for the recovery of the holy 
land : for, though John de Neule, who 
commanded the fleet equipped in Flan- 
ders, arrived at Ptolemais a little after 
Simon of Montfort, Renard of Dam- 
])ierrc, and others, yet the plague de- 
stroying many of them, and the rest 
either returnmg, or engaging in the 
petty quarrels of the Christian princes, 
there was nothing done ; so that the 
sultan of Aleppo easily defeated their 
troops in 1204. The sixth croisade be- 
gan hi 1228 ; in which the Christians 
took the town of Damietta, but were 
forced to sun-ender it again. In 1229, 
the emperor Frederic made peace with 
the sultan for ten vears. About 1240, 
Richard, earl of Cornwall, brother to 
Henry III. king of England, arrived at 
Palestine, at the head of the English 
croisade ; but finding it most advan- 
tageous to conclude a peace, he re- 
embarked, and steered towards Italy. 
In 1244, the Karasmians being driven 
out of Turkey by the Tartars, broke 
into Palestine, and gave the Christians 
u general defeat near Gaza. The se- 
venth croisade was headed, in 1249, by 
St. Lewis, who took the town of Dami- 
etta; but a sickness happening in the 
Christian army, the king endeavoured 
a retreat ; in which, being pursued by 
the infidels, most of his army were mi- 



serably butchered, and himself and the 
nobility taken prisoners. A truce was 
agreed upon for ten years, and the king 
and lords set at liberty. The eighth 
croisade, in 1279, was headed by the 
same prince, who made himself master 
of the port and castle of Carthage in 
Africa ; but dying a short time after, he 
left his army in a very ill condition. 
Soon after, the king of Sicily coming up 
with a good fleet, and joining Philip the 
bold, son and successor of Lewis, the 
king of Tunis, after several engage- 
ments with the Christians, in which he 
was always worsted, desired peace, 
which was granted upon conditions ad- 
vantageous to the Christians ; after 
which both princes embarked to their 
own kingdoms. Prince Edward, of 
England, who ari-ived at Tunis at the 
time of this treaty, sailed towards Pto- 
lemais, where he landed a small body 
of 300 English and French, and hinder- 
ed Bendochar from laying siege to Pto- 
lemais : but being obliged to return to 
take possession of the crown of England, 
this croisade ended without contributing 
any thing to the i-ecovery of the holy 
land. In 1291, the town of Acre or 
Ptolemais was taken and plundered by 
the sultan of Egypt, and the Christians 
quite driven out of Syria. There has 
I)een no croisade since that period, 
though several popes have attempted 
to stir up the Christians to such an un- 
dertaking ; particularly Nicholas IV. 
in 1292, and Clement V. in 1311. 

Though these croisades were effects 
of the most absurd superstition, they 
tended greatly to promote the good of 
Europe. Multitudes, indeed, were de- 
stroyed. M. Voltaire computes the 
people who perished in the different 
expeditions at upwards of two millions. 
Many there were, however, who re- 
turned ; and these having conversed so 
long with people who lived in a much 
more magnificent way than themselves, 
began to entertain some taste for a re- 
fined and polished way of life. Thus 
the barbarism in which Europe had 
been so long immersed began to wear 
off soon after. The princes also who 
remained at home, found means to avail 
themselves of tlie frenzy of the people. 
By the absence of such numbers of 
restless and martial adventurers, peace 
was established in their dominions. 
They also took the opportunity of an- 
nexing to their crowns many consider- 
able fiefs, either by purchase, or the 
extinction of the heirs; and thus the 
mischiefs which must always attend 
feudal governments were considerably 
lessened. AA''ith regard to the bad sue- 



CRO

cess of the croisadevs, it was scarcely 
possible that any other thing could hap- 
pen to them. The emperors of Constan- 
tinople, instead of assisting, did all in 
their power to disconcert their schemes : 
they were jealous, and not without rea- 
son, of such an inundation of barbarians. 
Yet, had they considered their true in- 
terest, they would rather have assisted 
them, or at least stood neuter, than 
enter into alliances with the Turks. 
They followed the latter method, how- 
ever, and were often of very great dis- 
sei-vice to the western adventurers, 
which at last occasioned the loss of 
their city. But the worst enemies the 
croisaders had were their own internal 
feuds and dissentions. They neither 
could agree while marching together 
in armies with a view to conquest, nor 
could they unite their conquests under 
one government after they had made 
them. They set vip three small states, 
one at Jerusalem, another at Antioch, 
and another at Edessa. These states, 
instead of assisting, made war upon 
each other, and on the Greek empe- 
rors ; and thus became an easy prcj' to 
the common enemy. The iiorrid cruel- 
ties they committed, too, must have 
inspired the Turks witli the most in- 
vincible hatred against them, and made 
them resist with the greatest obstinacy. 
They were such as could have been 
comvnitted only by barbarians inflamed 
with the most bigoted enthusiasm. 
When Jerusalem was taken, not only 
the numerous garrisons were put to the 
sword, but the inhabitants were massa- 
cred without mercy and without dis- 
tinction. No age or sex was spared, 
not even sucking children. According 
to Voltaire, some Christians, who had 
been suftered by the Turks to live in 
that city, led the conquerors into the 
most private caves, where women had 
concealed themselves with their chil- 
dren, and not one of them was suffered 
to escape. What eminently shows the 
enthusiasm by which tliese conquerors 
were animated, is, their behaviour after 
this terrible slaughter. They marched 
over heaps of dead bodies towards the 
holy sepulchre ; and while their hands 
were polluted with the blood of so many 
innocent persons, sung anthems to tlie 
common Saviour of Mankind ! Na}', so 
far did their religious enthusiasm over- 
come their fuiy, that these ferocious 
conquerors now burst into tears. If the 
absurdity and wickedness of their con- 
duct can be exceeded by any thing, it 
must be by what follows.' In 1204,"the 
frenzy of croisading seized the children, 
who are ever ready to imitate what 



they see their parents engaged &gt;ft. 
Their childish folly was encouraged by 
the monks and schoolmasters ; and 
tliousands of those innocents were con- 
ducted from the houses of their parents 
on the superstitious interpretation of 
these words: "Out of the mouths of 
babes and sucklings hast thou perfected 
praise." Their base conductors sold a 
])art of them to the Turks, and the rest 
perished miserably. Hume''s Hist, of 
England, vol. i. p. 292, &amp;:c. and vol. li.

CROISIEUS, a religious order, found- 
ed in honour of the invention or discove- 
ry of the cross by the empress Helena. 
They were, till of late, dispersed in se- 
veral parts of Europe, particularly ia 
tlie Low Countries, France, and Bohe- 
mia; those of Italy were suppressed 
c\c\\ before the late revolutions. These 
religious follow the rule of St. Augus- 
tine. They had in England the name 
of Crouched Friars. 

CROSIERjOrCROziER, a shepherd's

CROSS, in Scripture langxiage, means 
the sufferings ot Christ, Gal. vi. 14. 
The sufferings, trials, or persecution^i 
of the people are also called a cross. 
Matt. xvi. 24. CA&gt;ss signifies also a 
gibbet, made with two pieces of wood, 
placed crosswise, whether they cross 
with right angles at the top like a T, 
or m the middle of their length like aii 
X. The cross to which our Savioui' 
was fastened, and on which he died, 
was of the former kind ; being thus re- 
presented by old monuments, coins, and 
crosses. The death of the cross was 
the most dreadful of all others, both for^ 
the shame and pain of it; and so scan- 
dalous, that it was inflicted as the last 
mark of detestation upon the vilest of 
people. It was the punishment of rob- 
bers and murderers, provided that they 
were slaves too ; but otherwise, if they 
were free, and had the privilege of the 
city of Rome, this was then thought a 
prostitution of that honour, and too in- 
famous a punishment for such a one, 
let his crimes be what they would. The 
form of a cross being such as has been 
already described, the body of the cri- 
minal was fastened to the upright piece 
by nailing the feet to it, and on the 
other transverse piece generallv by 
nailing the hands on each side. Now, 
because these parts of the body, beuig 
It

tlie instruments of action and motion, 
are pi'ovided by Nature with a much 
greater quantity of nerves than others 
have occasion for ; and because all sen- 
sation is performed by the spirit con- 
tained in the nerves ; it will follow, as 
Stanhope observes, that v/herever they 
abound, the sense of pain must needs in 
proportion be more quick and tender. 
The Jews confess, indeed, that they 
cinicified people in their nation, but 
deny that they inflicted this punishment 
upon any one alive. They first put 
them to death, and then fastened them 
to the cross, either by the hands or 
neck. But there are indisputable jirooft 
of their crucifying men frequently alive. 
The worshippers of Baal-peor, and the 
king of Ai were hung up alive ; as were 
also the descendants of Saul, who were 
put into the harxls of the Gibeonites, 
2 Sam. xxi. 9. 

Before cinicifixion, the criminal was 
generally scourged with cords ; some- 
tunes little bones, or pieces of bones, 
were tied to these scourges, so tliat the 
condemned person might suffer more 
severely. It was also a cu&lt;itom, that he 
who was to be cniciiied should bear his 
own cross to the place of execution. 
After this manner, we find Christ was 
compelled to bear lais cross ; and as he 
sunk under the burden, Simon the Cy- 
renian was constrained to bear it after 
him and with him. But whereas it is 
generally supposed that our Lord bore 
the whoie crot;s, i. e. the long and trans- 
verse part both, tliis seems to be a thing- 
impossible \ and therefore Lipsius (in 
his treatise De Supjdicio Crucw) lias 
set the matter in a true light, when he 
tells us that Jesus only carried the 
transverse beam ; because the long 
beam, or the body of the cross, was 
either fixed in the ground before, or 
made rcadj' to be set up as soon as the 
prisoner came ; and from hence he ob- 
seiwes, that painters are very much 
mistaken in the description of our Sa- 
viour can-ying the whole cross. There 
were several ways of cinicifying ; some- 
times the criminal was fastened with 
cords to a tree, sometimes he was cru- 
cified with his head downwards. This 
w^ay, it is said, Peter chose, out of re- 
spect to his master, Jesus Christ, not 
thiukmg himself woithy to be crucified 
like him ; though the common wa.y of 
crucifying was b\- fastening the criminal 
with nails, one through each hand, and 
one through both feet, or one through 
each of them ; for this was not always 
performed in the same manner ; the 
ancients sometimes represent Jesus j 
Christ crucified with four nails, and| 



sometimes with three. The criminal 
was fixed to the cross quite naked ; and, 
in all probability, the Saviour of sinners 
was not used with any greater tender- 
ness than others upon whom this pu- 
nishment was biflicted. The text of the 
Gospel shows clearly that Jesus Christ 
was fastened to the cross with nails; 
and the Psalmist (Ps. xxii. 16.) had 
foretold long before, that they sliould 
pierce iiis hands and his feet ; but there 
are great disputes concerning tlie num- 
ber of these nails. The Greeks repre-' 
sent our Saviour as fastened to the cross 
with four nails; in which particular 
Gregory of Tours agrees with them, 
one on each hand and foot. But several 
are of opinion that our Saviour's hands 
and feet were pierced with three nails 
onl)% viz. one on each hand, and one 
through both his feet : and the custom 
of the Latins is ratlier for this last 
opinion; for the generality of the old 
cnicifixes made in the Latin church 
have only three nails. Nonnus thinks 
that our Sa\-iour's ainns were besides 
bound fast to the ci'oss with chains ; and 
St. Hilary speaks of the cords where- 
with he was tied to it. Sometimes they 
who were fastened upon the cross lived 
a good while in that condition. St. An- 
drew is believed to have continued three 
days alive upon it. Eusebius speaks of 
certain martyrs in Eg)'pt who were kept 
upon the cross till they were starv^ed to 
death. Pilate was amazed at Jesus 
Christ's dying so soon, because natural- 
ly he must have lived longer, if it had 
not been in his power to have laid down 
his life, and to take it up again. The 
thighs of the two thieves, who were 
crucified -with our Saviour, were broken, 
in order to hasten their death, that their 
bodies might not i-emain upon the cross 
on the Sabbath day, John xix. 31, 33 ; 
and to comply with the law of Moses, 
which forbids' the bodies to be left there 
after sun-set. But, among other nations, 
they were suffered to remain upon the 
cross a long time. Sometimes they were 
devoured alive by birds and beasts of 
prey. Guai-ds w'ei'e appointed to ob- 
serve that none of their friends or rela- 
tions should take them down and bury 
them. Tlie Roman soldiers, who had 
crucified Jesus Christ and the two 
thieves, continued near the crosses till 
the bodies were taken down and buried. 
Invention of the Cross, an ancient 
feast solemnized on the 3d of May, in 
memory of St. Helena's (the mother of 
Constantine) finding the true cross of 
Christ deep in the ground on Mount 
Calvary, where she erected a church 
for the preservation of part of it; the

rest being brought to Rome, and depo- 
sited in the church of the Holy Cross 
of Jerusalem. 

Exaltation of the Cross, an ancient 
feast held on the 14th of September, in 
memory of this, that Heraclitus resto- 
red to Mount Calvary the true cross, in 
642, which had been carried off four- 
teen years before bv Cosrocs, kin^ of 
Persia, upon his taking Jei-usalem irom 
the emperor Phocas. 

The Adoration of the Cross seems to 
have been practised in tlie ancient 
church, in as much as the heathens, 
particularly Julian, reproached the pri- 
mitive Christians with it ; and we do 
not find that their apologists disclaimed 
the charge. Mornay, indeed, asserted 
that this had been done by St. Cyril, 
but could not support his odlegation at 
the conference of Fontainbleau. St. 
Helena is said to have reduced the ado- 
ration of the cross to its just principle, 
since she adored Christ in the wood, not 
the wood itself. With such modifica- 
tions some Protestants have been in- 
duced to admit t!ie adoration of the 
cross. John Huss allowed of the phrase, 
provided it were expressly added, that 
the adoration was relative to the person 
of Christ. But, however Roman catho- 
lics may seem to triumph by virtue of 
such distinction and mitigations, it is 
well known they have no great place 
in their own practice. Imbeit, the 
prior of Gasconv, was severely prose- 
cuted in 1683, for telling the people, 
that, in the ceremony of adoring the 
cross, practised in that church on Good 
Friday, they were not to adore the 
Av oocL. but Christ, who was crucified on 
it. The curate of the parish told them 
the contrary. It was the wood ; the 
wood they were to adore ! Imbert re- 
plied, it was Christ, not the wood ; for 
which he was cited before the arch- 
bishop of Bourdeaux, suspended from 
his fimctions, and eA^en threatened with 
chains and pci-petual imprisonment. It 
little availed him to cite the bishop of 
Meaux's distinction ; it was answered, 
that the church allowed it not. 

CROSS-BEARER, in the Romish 
church, the chaplain of an archbisliop, 
ivho bears a cross before him on solemn 
occasions. Cross-bearers also denote 
certain officers in the Inquisition, who 
make a vow befoi-e the Inquisitors, or 
their vicars, to defend the catholic faith, 
though with the loss of fortune and life. 
Their business is also to provide the 
Inquisitors with necessaries.

CURATE, the lowest degree in the 
church of England ; he who represents 
the incumbent of a church, parson, or 
vicar, and officiates in his stead : he is 
to be licensed and admitted by the bi- 
shop of the diocese, or by an ordinary 
havmg episcopal jurisdiction; and when 
a curate hath the approljation of t}ie 
bishop, he usually appoints the salaiT 
too ; and, in such case, if he be not paid, 
the curate hath a proper remedy in the 
ecclesiastical court, by a sequestration 
of the profits of the benefice : but if the 
curate be not licensed by the bishop, 
he is put to his remedy at common law, 
where he must prove the agreement, 
&amp;c. A curate, having no fixed estate 
in his curacy, not being histituted and 
inducted, may be removed at pleasure 
by the bishop, or incumbent. But there 
are perpetual curates as well as tem- 
porary, who are appointed where tithes 
are impropriate, and no vicarage en- 
dowed : these are not removeable, and 
the improprietors are obliged to find 
them ; some whereof have certain por- 
tions of the tithes settled on them. Cu- 
rates must subscribe the declai'ation 
according to the act of unifomnity, or 
are liable to imprisonment. Though 
the condition of curates be somewhat 
ameliorated by a late act, it must be 
confessed that they are still, in many 
respects, exposed to hai'dships: their 
salaries are not equal to many dissent- 
ing ministers, who have nothing to de- 
pend on but the liberality of their peo- 
ple. Can there be a greater reproach to 
the dignified ecclesiastics of this coim- 
try, than the comparatively miserable 
pittance allowed the curates, who do all 
the labour? Surcl)' they must be a set of 
useless beings, to reap so little wages ; 
or else they are unjustly treated ! ! ! 

CURIOSITY, a propensity or dispo- 
sition of the soul which inclines it to 
enquire after new objects, and to delight 
in viewing them. Curiosity is proper, 
when it sprmgs from a desu'e to knoAV' 
our duty, to mature our judgments, to 
enlarge our minds, and to regtdate oui- 
conduct ; but improper when it wishes 
to know more of God, of the decrees ; th e 
origin of evil ; the state of men, or tlie 
nature of things, than it is designed tor 
us to know. 1 he ex'il of this is evident. 
It reproaches God's goodness ; it is a 
violation of Scripture, Dcut. xxiJ. 29 ; it 
robs us of our time ; it often makes us, 
unhappy, lessens our usefulness, and

jyroduces mischief. To cure this dispo- 
sition let us consider the di\'ine com- 
mand, Phil. iv-. 6. that eveiy thing es- 
sential is i-evealed; that God cannot 
en- ; that we shall be satisfied in a fu- 
ture state, Is. xiii. 7. Curiosity concern- 
ing the affairs of others is exceedingly 
reprehensible. " It interrupts," says an 
elegant writer, " the order, and breaks 
the peace of society. Persons of this 
disposition are dangerous troublers of 
the world. Crossing the lines in which 
others move, they create confusion, and 
awaken resentment. Hence, many a 
friendship has been broken ; the peace 
of many a family has been overthrown ; 
and much bitter and lasting discord has 
been propagated through society. Such 
a disposition is entirely the reverse of 
that amiable spirit of charity our Lord 
inculcates. Charity, like the sun, briglit- 
ens eveiy object on which it shines: a 
censorious disposition casts evciy cha- 
racter into the darkest shade it will 
bear. It is to be further observed, that 
all impertinent curiosity about the af- 
fairs of others tends greatly to olistruct 
personal reformation, They who are 
so officiously occupied about their neigli- 
bour.s, have little leisure, and less in- 
clination, to observe their own defects, 
or to vTiind their own duty, Fi-om their 
inquisitive reseai'ches, they find, or 
imagine they find, in the behaviour of 
othei's, an apology for their own fail- 
ings; and the favourite result of their 
enquiries generally is, to rest satisfied 
■with themselves. We should consider, 
also, that every excursion of vain curi- 
osity about others is a subtraction from 
that time and thought which are due to 
ourselves, and to God. In the great 
circle of human affairs, there is room 
for every one to be busy, and well em- 
ploved in his own province, without 
encroaching upon that of others. It is 
the province of superiors to direct ; of 
inferiors to obey ; of the learned to be 
instructive ; of the ignorant to be docile ; 
of the old to be communicative ; of the 
young to be adviseable and diligent. 
Jn all the various relations which sub- 
sist among us in life, as husband and 
"wife, master and servants, parents and 
children, relations and friends, lailers 
and subjects, innumerable duties stand 
ready to be performed ; innumerable 
calls to activity present themselves on

advantage and honour the whole time 
of man." Blair's Serm. vol. iv. ser. 8 ;

CURSE, the action of wishing any 
t rcmendous evil to another. In Scrip- 



ture language it s'^nifies the just and 
lawful sentence of God's law, condemn- 
ing sinners to suffer the full punishment 
of their sin. Gal. iii. 10. 

CURSING and Swearing. See 
Swearing. 

CUSTOM, a very comprehensive 
term, denoting the manners, ceremo- 
nies, and fashions of a people, which 
having turned into habit, and passed 
into use, obtain the force of laws. Cus- 
tom and habit are often confounded. 
By custom, we mean a frequent reitera- 
tion of the same act ; and by habit, the 
effect that custom has on the mind or 
the body. See Habit. 

"Viewing man," says Lord Kames, 
"as a sensitive being, and perceiving 
the influence of novelty upon him, would 
one suspect that custom has an equal 
influence ? and yet our nature is equally 
susceptible of both ; not only in different 
objects, but frequently in the same. 
When an object is new, it is enchanting; 
familiaritv renders it indifferent; and 
custom, after a longer familiarity, makes 
it again desirable. Human nature, di- 
versified with many and various springs 
of action, is wonderful, and indulging 
the expres.sion, intricately constnacted. 
Custom hath such influence upon many 
of our feelings, by warping and varying 
them, that we must attend to its opera- 
tions, if we would be acquainted with 
human nature. A walk upon the quar- 
ter-deck, though intolerably confined, 
becomes, however, so agreeable by 
custom, that a sailor, in his walk on 
shore, confines himself commonly with- 
in the same bounds. I knew a man who 
had relinquished the sea for a country 
life: in the comer of his garden he 
reared an artificial mount, with a level 
summit, resembling, most accurately, a 
quarter-deck, not only in shape, but in 
size ; and here was his choice walk." 
Such we find is often the power of cus- 
tom. 

CYNICS, a sect of ancient philoso- 
phers, who valued themselves upon 
their contempt of riches and state, arts 
and sciences, and every thing, in short, 
except virtue and morality. They owe 
their origin and institution to Antisthenes 
of Athens, a disciple of Socrates ; who 
being asked of what use his philosophy 
had been to him, replied, " it enables 
me to live with myself." Diogenes was 
the most famous of his disciples, in 
whose life the system of this philosophy 
appears in its greatest perfection. He 
led a most whimsical life, despising 
everv kind of convenience ; a tub serving 
him for a l"'d'-';;ng, which he rolled be- 
fore him wherever he went: yet he \vas

not the more humble on account of his 
ragged cloak, bag and tub. One day 
entering Plato's house, at a time when 
there was a splendid entei-tainmcnt for 
several persons of distinction, he jump- 
ed, in all his dirt, upon a very rich couch, 
saying, "I trample on the pride of 
Plato!" "yes," replied Plato, "but with 



still greater pride, Diogenes !" He had 
the utmost contempt for all the human 
race ; for he walked the street of Athens 
at noon day, with a lighted lantern in 
his hand, telling the people " he was in 
search of an honest man. But with all 
his maxims of morality, he held some 
very pernicious opmions. 



D. 



Dx\MIANISTS, a denomination in 
the sixth century, so called from Da- 
mian, bishop of Alexandria. Their opi- 
nions were the same as the Angelites, 
which see. 

Dj^MONS, a name given by the an- 
cients to certain spirits or genii, which, 
they say, appeared to men, either to do 
them service, or to hurt them. 

Several of the heathen philosophers 
lield that there were different kinds of 
dxmons ; that some of them were spi- 
i-itual substances, of a more noble origin 
than the human race, and that others 
had once been men. 

But those dxmons who were the more 
immediate objects of the established 
worship among the ancient nations were 
human spirits, such as were believed to 
become dxmons, or deities, after their 
departure from their bodies. 

It has been generally thought, that by 
dsemons we are to understand dexu'ls, 
in the Septuagint version of the Old 
Testament. Others think the word is 
in that version certainly applied to the 
ghosts of such dead men as the hea- 
thens deified, in Deut. xxxii. 17. Ps. cvi. 
37. That dxmoii often bears the same 
meaning in the New Testament, and 
particularly in Acts xvii. 18. 1 Cor. x. 
21. 1 Tim. iv. 1. Rev. ix. 13. is shown 
at large by Mr. Joseph Mede, (see 
Works, p. 623, et. seq.) That the word 
is applied always to human spirits hi 
the New Testament, Mr. Farmer has 
attempted to shew in his Essay on Dse- 
moniacs, p. 208. et. seq. As to the mean- 
ing of the word Dxmon in the fathers 
of the Christian church, it is used by 
them in the same sense as it was by the 
heathen philosophers, especially the 
latter Platonists ; that is, sometimes for 
departed human spirits, and at other 
times for such spirits as had never in- 
habited human bodies. In the fathers, 
indeed, the word is more commonly ta- 
ken in an evil sense, than in the ancient 
philosophers. 

D&gt;?iMONIAC, a human being whose 



volition and other mental faculties are 
oveipowered and restrained, and his 
body possessed and actuated by some 
created spiritual being of superior pow- 
er. Such seems to be the determniate 
sense of the word ; but it is disputed 
whether any of mankind ever were in 
this unfortunate condition. That the 
reader may form some judgment, we 
shall lay before him the arguments on 
both sides. 

I. Dxmoniacs, arguments against the 
existence of. Those who are unwilling 
to allow that angels or devils have ever 
intermeddled with the concerns of hu- 
man life, urge a number of specious ar- 
guments. 1 he Greeks and Romans of 
old, say they, did beheve in the reality 
of dacmoniacal possession. They sup- 
posed that spiritual beings did at times 
enter into the sons and daughters of 
men, and distinguish themselves in that 
situation by capricious freaks, deeds of 
wanton mischief, or prophetic enuncia- 
tions. But in the instances in which 
they supposed this to happen, it is evi- 
dent no such thing took place. Their 
accounts. of the state and conduct of 
those persons whom they believed to be 
possessed in this supernatural manner, 
show plainly that what they ascribed 
to the influence of dsemons were merely 
the effect of natural diseases. What- 
ever they relate concerning the larvati, 
the cerr'iti, and the lymphatici, shows 
that these were merely people disor- 
dered in mind, in the same unfortunate 
situation with those madmen, ideots, 
and melancholy persons, whom we have 
among ourselves. Festus describes thc 
larvati, as being furiosi et niente moti. 
Lucian describes dsemoniacs as lunatic, 
and as staring with their eyes, foaming 
at the mouth, and being speechless. It 
appears still more evident that all the 
pei'sons spoken of as possessed with 
devils in the New Testament, were 
I either mad or epileptic, and preciseh 
! in the same condition with the madmen 
jand epileptics of modem times. Th(

Jews, among other I'eproaches which 
they threw out against our Saviour, 
said, He hath a devil, and is mad ; ivhy 
hear ye him ? The expressions he hath 
a devil, and z&gt; mud, were certainly 
used on this occasion as s)'nonymous. 
With all their virulence, tliey would 
not surely ascribe to him at once two 
things that were inconsistent and con- 
tradictory. Those who thought more 
fa\'ourably of the character of Jesus, 
asserted concerning his discourses, in 
reply to his adversaries. These are not 
the words of him that hath a dpemon; 
meaning, no doubt, that he spoke in a 
more rational manner than a madman 
could be expected to speak. The Jews 
appear to have ascribed to the influence 
of dxmons,not only that species of mad- 
ness in which the patient is raving and 
furiei's, but also melayicholy madness. 
Of John, who secluded himself from in- 
tercoji.rse Vv'ith the ^vorld, and was dis- 
tinguished for abstinence and acts of 
mortification, they said. He hath a dx- 
vion. The youth, whose father applied 
to Jesus to fi'ee him from an evil spirit, 
describing his unhappy condition in 
these woi'ds, have mercy on my son, 
for he is lunatic, and sore vexed with a j 
dccmon ; for oft times he fulleth into the 
fire, and oft into the water, was plainly 
epileptic. Every thing, indeed, that is 
related in the New Testament concern- 
ing dxmoniacj;, proves that they were 
people affected with such natural disea- 
ses as are far from being \mcommon 
among mankind in the present age. j 
When the symptoms of the disorders ; 
cured by our Saviour and his apostles i 
as cases of dscmoniacal possession cor- ! 
respond so exactly with those of disea- j 
ses well known as natural in the present 
age, it would be absmxl to impute them i 
to a supernatural cause. It is much 
more consistent with common sense and j 
sound philosophy to suppose that our , 
Saviour and his apostles wisel)', and i 
with that condescension to the weak- I 
ness and prejudices of those with whom 
they conversed, which so eminently dis- 
tinguished the character of the Author 
of ovu- hoh' religion, and must always be 
a prominent feature in the character of 
the true Christian, adopted the vulgar 
language in speaking of those unfortu- 
nate pei-sons who Avere groundlessly 
imagined to be possessed witli demons, 
though they well knew tlie notions 
which had given rise to such modes of 
expression to be ill founded, than to 
imagine that diseases which arise at 
present from natural causes, were pro- 
duced in days of old by the intervention 
of dxmons, or that evil spirits still con- 



tinue to enter into mankind in all cases 
of madness, melancholy, or epilepsy 
Besides, it is by no means a sufficient 
reason for receiving any doctrine as 
true, that it has been generally received 
through the world. Error, like an 
epidemical disease, is communicated 
from one to another. In certain cir- 
cumstances, too, the influence of ima- 
gination predominates, and restrains the 
exertions of reason. Manj^ false opi- 
nions have extended their influence 
through a very wide circle and main- 
tained it long. On every such occasion 
as the present, therefore, it becomes us 
to enquire not so much how generally 
any opinion has been received, or how 
long it has prevailed, as from what 
cause it has originated, and on what 
evidence it rests. When we contem- 
plate the frame of Nature, v/e behold a 
grand and beautiful simplicity prevail- 
ing through the whole: notwithstanding 
its immense extent, and though it con- 
tains such numberless diversities of be- 
ing, yet the simplest machine construct- 
ed by human art does not display great- 
er snnplicity, or an happier connection 
of parts. VVe may, therefore, infer by 
analogy, from what is observable of the 
order of Nature in general to the pre- 
sent case, that to permit evil spirits to 
intermeddle with the concerns of hu- 
man life, would be to break through 
that order which the Deity appears to 
have established through his works ; it 
would be to introduce a degree of con- 
fusion unworthy of the wisdom of Di- 
vine Providence. 

II. Deemoniacs,argu7nentsfor the ex- 
istence of. In opposition to these ai'gu- 
ments, the foUowing.are urged by the 
Djemonianists. In the days of our Sa- 
viour, it would appear that dxmoniacal 
possession was very frequent among 
the Jews and the neighbouring na.tions. 
Many were the evil spirits whom Jesus 
is related in the Gospels to have ejected 
from patients that were brought unto 
h im as possessed and tormented by those 
malevolent dxmons. His apostles too, 
and the fir^t Christians, who were most 
active and successful in the propagation 
of Christianity, appear to have often ex- 
erted the mirrxulous powers with which 
they were endowed on similar occasions. 
The daemons displayed a degree of 
knowledge and malevolence wliich suf- 
ficiently distinguished them from human 
beings: and the language in which the 
djemoniacs are mentioned, and the ac- 
tions and sentiments ascribed to them in 
the New Testament, show that our Sa- 
viour and his apostles did not consider 
the idea of dxmoniacal possession as

being merelv a vulgar error concerning 
the origin of a disease or diseases pro- 
duced by natural causes. The more en- 
lightened cannot always avoid the use 
of metaphorical modes of expression ; 
which though founded upon error, yet 
have been so established m language by 
the influence of custom, that they cannot 
be suddenly dismissed. But in descrip- 
tions of cliaracters, in the narration of 
facts, and in the laying down of systems 
of doctrine, we require different rules to 
be observed. Should any person, in 
compliance with popular opinions, tall: 
in serious language of the existence, 
dispositions, declarations, and actions of 
a race of beings whom he knew to be 
absolutely fabulous, we surely could not 
praise him for integrity : we must sup- 
pose him to be either exulting in irony 
over the weak credulity of those around 
hirn, or taking advantage of their weak- 
ness, with tiie dishonesty and selfish 
views of an impostor. And if he himself 
should pretend to any connection with 
this imaginary system of beings ; and 
should claim, in consequence of his con- 
nection with them, particular honours 
from his contemporaries; whatever 
might be the dignity of his character in 
all other respects, nobody could hesitate 
to brand him as an impostor. In this 
light must we regard the conduct of our j 
Saviour and his ai:)ostles, if the idea of 
dxmoniacal possession were to be con- 
sidered merely as a vulgar error. They 
talked and acted as if they believed that 
evil spirits had actually entered into 
those who v/ere brought to tliem as 
possessed with devils, and as if those 
spirits had been actually expelled by 
their authority out of the' unhappy per- 
sons whom they had possessed. They 
demanded, too, to have their professions 
and declai-ations believed, in conse- 
quence of tlieir performing such mighty 
vv^oi'ks, and having thus triumphed over 
the powers of hell. The reality of 
demoniacal possession stands upon the 
same evidence with the Gospel system 
in general. Nor is there any thing un- 
reasonable in this doctrine. It does not 
appear to contradict those ideas which 
the general appearances of Natirre and 
the series of events suggest, concerning 
the benevolence and wisdom of the 
Deity, by which he regulates the affairs 
of the universe. We often fancv our- 
selves able to comprehend things to 
which our understanding is wholly in- 
adequate ; we persuade ourselves, at 
times, that the whole extent of the 
works of the Deity must be well known 
to us, and that his designs must always 
be such as we can fathom. We are 



then ready, whenever any difiiculty 
arises to us in considering the conduct 
of Providence, to model things accord- 
ing to our own ideas ; to deny that the 
Deity can possibly be the author of 
things which we cannot reconcile ; and 
to assert, that he must act on e^"».ry oc- 
casion in a manner consistent with our 
narrow views. This is the pride of rea- 
son; and it seems to have suggested the 
strongest objections that have been at 
any time urged against the reality of 
dremoniacal possession. But the Deity 
may surely connect one order of his 
creatures with another. We perceive 
mutual relations and a beautiful connec- 
tion to prevail through all that part of 
Nature which falls within the sphere of 
our observation. The inferior animals 
are connected with mankind, and sub- 
jected to their authority, not only in in- 
stances in which it is exerted for their 
advantage, but even where it is tyran- 
nically abused to their destniction. 
Among the evUs to which mankind have 
been subjected, why might not their be- 
ing liable to dxmoniacal possession be 
one ? While the Supreme Being retains 
the sovereignty of the universe, he may 
employ whatever agents he thinks pro- 
per in the execution of his pui-poses; 
he may either commission an angel, or 
let loose a devil; as well as bend the 
human will, or communicate any parti- 
cular impulse to matter. All that reve- 
lation makes known, all that human 
reason can conjecture, concerning the 
existence of various orders of spiritual 
beings, good and bad, is perfectly con- 
sistent with, and even favourable to, the 
doctrine of demoniacal possession. It 
is mentioned in the New Testament in 
such language, and such nan*atives are 
related concerning it, that the Gospels 
cannot be well regarded in any other 
light than as pieces of imposture, and 
Jesus Christ must be considered as a 
man who took advantage of the weak- 
ness and ignorance of his contempora- 
ries, if this doctrine be nothing but a 
vulgar error ; it teaches nothing incon- 
sistent with the general conduct of Pro- 
vidence; in short, it is not the caution of 
philosophy, but the pride of reason that 
suggests objections against this doctrine.

DAMNATION, condemnation. Tliis 
word is used to denote the final loss of 
the soul ; but it is not always to be un- 
derstood in this sense in the sacred 
Scripture. Thus it is said in Rom. xhv

3. "They that resist shall receive to 
themselves damnation," i. e. condemna- 
tion, " from the rulers, who are not a 
terror to good works, but to the evil." 
Again, in 1 Cor. xi. 29. " He that eat- 
eth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and 
drinketh damnation to himself;" i. e. 
condemnation; exposes himself to se- 
vere temporal judgments from God, and 
to the judgment and censure of the wise 
and good. Again, Rom. xiv. 23. " He 
that doubteth is damned if he eat ;" i. e. 
is condemned both by his own con- 
science, and the word of God, because 
he is far from being satisfied that he is 
right in so doing. 

DANCERS, a sect which sprung up 
about 1373 in Flanders, and places 
about. It was their custom all of a sud- 
den to fall a dancing, and, holding each 
other's hands, to continue thereat, till, 
being suffocated with the extraordinary 
violence, they fell down breatliless to- 
gether. During these intervals of vehe- 
ment agitation they pretended to be fa- 
voured with wonderful visions. Like 
the Whippers, they roved from place 
to place, begging their victuals, holding 
their secret assemblies, and treating the 
priesthood and worship of the church 
with the utmost contempt. Thus we 
find, as Dr. Haweis observes, that the 
French Convulsionists and the Welch 
Jumpers have had predecessors of the 
same stump. There is nothing new un- 
der the sun. Hanveis, and Moslieim^a

DARKNESS, the absence, privation, 
or want of natural light. In Scripture 
language it also signifies sin, John iii. 19.

Matt. X. 27. forgetfulness, contempt, 
Ecc. vi. 4. 

Darkness, says Moses, was upon the 
face of the deep, Gen. i. 2. that is to say 
the chaos was plunged in thick dark- 
ness, because hitherto the light was not 
created. Moses, at the command of 
Gcxl, brought darkness upon Eg}T)t, as 
a plague to the inhabitants of it." The 
Septuagint, our translation, of the Bible, 
and indeed most others, in explaining 
Moses's account of this darkness, ren- 
der it " a darkness which may be felt ;" 
and the Vulgate has it, "palpable dark- 
ness;" that is, a darkness consisting 
of black vapours and exhalations, so 
condensed that they might be perceived 
by the organs of feeling or seeing ; but 
some commentators think that this is 
carrying the sense too far, since, in such 
a medium as this, mankind could not 
live an hour, much less for the space of 
three days, as the Egyptians are said to 
have done, during the time this dark- 



ness lasted ; and, therefore, they ima-' 
gine that instead of a darkness that may 
be felt, the Hebrew phrase may signify 
a darkness wherein men went groping 
and feeling about for every thing they 
wanted. Let this, however, be as it may, 
it was an awfiil judgment on the Egyp- 
tians ; and we may naturally conclude 
that it must have also spread darkness 
and distress over their minds as well as 
their persons. The tradition of the Jews 
is, that in this darkness they were teri'i- 
fied by the apparitions of evil spirits, or 
rather by dreadful sounds and murmurs 
which they made. What made it still 
worse, was the length of time it con- 
tinued ; three days, or as bishop Hall 
expresses it, six nights in one. 

During the last three hours that our 
Saviour hung upon the cross, a darkness 
covered the face of the earth, to the 
great terror and amazement of the 
people present at his execution. This 
extraordinan- alteration in the face of 
nature, says Dr. Macknight, in his Har- 
mony of the Gospels, was peculiarly 
proper, whilst the Sun of Righteousness 
was withdrawing his beams fi-om the 
land of Israel, and from the world ; not 
only because it was a miraculous testi- 
mony borne by God himself to his inno- 
cence, but also because it was a fit em- 
blem of his departure and its effects, at 
least till his light shone out anew with 
additional splendour in the ministry of 
his apostles. The darkness which now 
covered Judea, and the neighbouring 
countries, beginning about noon, and 
continuing till Jesus expired, was not 
the effect of an ordinary eclipse of the 
sun, for that can never happen but at 
the new moon, whereas now it was full 
moon ; not to mention that the total 
darkness occasioned by eclipses of the 
sun never continues above twelve or 
fifteen minutes; wherefore it must have 
been produced by the divine power, in 
a manner we are not able to explain. 
Accordingly Luke (chap, xxiii. 44, 45.) 
after relating that there was darkness 
over all the earth, adds, " and the sun 
was darkened;" which perhaps may 
implv that the darkness of the sun did 
not occasion, but proceeded from, the 
darkness that was over all the land. 
Farther, the Christian writers, in their 
most ancient apologies to the heathens, 
affirm that as it was full moon at the 
passover when Christ was crucified, no 
such eclipse could happen by the course 
of nature. They observe, also, that it 
was taken notice of as a prodigy by the 
heathens themselves.

began to pveach a new doctrine, pub- 
lishing himself to be the true Messiah ; 
and that he was sent of God to fill hea- 
ven, which was quite empty for want 
of people to deserve it. He is likewise 
said to have denied the existence of an- 
gels good and evil, and to have disbe- 
lieved the doctrine of a future judgment. 
He rejected marriage with the Adam- 
ites; held with Manes, that the soul was 
not defiled by sin ; and laughed at t)ie 
self-denial so much recommended bj- 
Jesus Christ. Such were his principal 
errors. He made his escape from Delft, 
and retired first to Friesland, and then 
to Basil, where he changed his name, 
assuming that of John Bruck, and died 
in 1556. He left some disciples behind 
him, to whom he promised that he would 
rise again at the end of three years. 
Nor was he altogether a false prophet 
herein ; for the magistrates of that city 
being informed, at the three years' end, 
of what he had taught, ordered him to 
be dug up and burnt, together with his 
writings, by the common hangman. 

DEACON, Aiaxovoj, a servant, a mi- 
nister. 

1. In ecclesiastical polity, a deacon is 
©ne of the lowest of the three orders of 
the clergy. He is rather a novitiate, or 
in a state of probation for one year, af- 
ter which he is admitted into full ordci's, 
©r ordained a priest. 

2. In the New Testament the word is 
used for any one that ministers in the 
service of God : bishops and presbyters 
are also styled deacons ; but more par- 
ticularly and generally it is understood 
of the lowest order of ministering ser- 
vants in the church, 1 Cor. iii. 5. Col. i. 
23, 25. Phil. i. 1. 1 Tim. iii. 

The office of deacons originally was to 
serve tables, the Lord's table, the mi- 
nister's table, and the poor's table. They 
took care of the secular affairs of the 
church, received and disbursed monies, 
kept the church's accounts, and pro- 
vided every thing necessary for its tem- 
poral good. Thus, while the bishop at- 
tended to the souls, the deacons attended 
to the bodies of the people : the pastor 
to the spiritual, and the deacons the 
temporal interests of the church. Acts vi. 

DEACONESS, a female deacon. It 
is generally allowed, that in the primi- 
tive church there were deaconesses, i. e. 
pious women, whose particular business 
it was to assist in the entertainment and 
«are of the itinerant preachers, visit the 
sick and imprisoned, instruct female 
catechumens, and assist at their bap- 
iism ; then more particularly necessary, 
from the peculiar customs of those coun- 
tries, the persecuted state of the church. 



and the speedier spreading of the Gos- 
pel. Such a one it is reasonable to think 
Phebe was, Rom. xvi. 1. who is ex*' 
pressly called Smx^mv, a deaconess or 
stated servant, as Di-. Doddridge renders 
it. They were usually widows, and, to 
prevent scandal, generally in years, 1 
rim. V. 9. See also Spanheim. Hist. 
Christ. Secul. 1. p. 554. The apostolic 
constitutions, as tney are called, mention 
the ordination of a deaconess, and the 
form of prayer used on that occasion, 
(lib. viii. ch. 19, 20.) Pliny also, in life 
celebrated epistle to Trajan (xcvii.) is 
thought to refer to them, when, speak- 
ing of two female Christians whom he 
put to the tortui'e, he says, qux ministrai 
dicebantur, i. e. who were called dea- 
conesses. — But as the primitive Chris- 
tians seem to be led to this practice 
from the peculiai'ity of their circum- 
stances, and the Scripture is entirely si- 
lent as to any appointment to this sup- 
l&gt;oscd office, or any iiilcs about it, it is 
very justly laid aside, at least as an office. 

DEAN, an ecclesiastical dignitary, 
next under the bishop in cathedral 
churches, and head of the chapter. 
The Latin word is decanus, derived 
from the Greek Asxa, ten, because the 
dean presides over at least ten canons, 
or prebendaries. A dean and chapter 
ai'c the bishop's council, to assist him in 
the affairs of religion. 

DEATH is generally defined to be

44 ; and as he may be the executioner 
of God's wrath on impenitent sinners, 
when God permits him. Death is but

i&gt;ible ; but to a good man it shoiiUl be 
obviated by the consideration that death 
is the termination of every trouble ; that 
it puts him beyond the reach of sin and 
temptation : that God has promised to 
be with the righteous, even to the end,

Prejxaration for death. This does 
not consist in bare morality ; in an ex- 
ternal reformation from gross sins ; in 
attention to a round of duties in our own 
strength ; in acts of charity ; in a zeal- 
ous profession ; in possessing eminent 
gifts : but in reconciliation to God ; re- 
pentance of sin ; faith in Christ ; obe- 
dience to his word : and all as the ef- 
fect of regeneration by the Spirit. 3

Spiintual Death is that awful state of 
ignorance.insensibility, and disoljcdience, 
which mankind are 'in by nature, and 
which exclude them from the favour and 
enjoyment of God, Luke i. 79. See Sin. 
Brothers of Death, a denomination 
nsually given to the religious of the or- 
der of St. Paul, the first hermit. They 
are called brothers of death, on account 
of the figure of a deatli's head which they 
were always to have with them, in or- 
der to keep perpetually before them the 
thoughts of death. The order was pro- 
bably suppressed by pope Urban \in. 
Death of Christ. The circumstances 
attendant on the deatli of Christ are so 
well known, that they need not be in- 
serted here. As the subject, however, 
'of all others, is the most important to 
the Christian, a brief abstract of what 
has been said on it, from a sermon al- 
lowedly one of the best in the En^ish 
language, shall here be given. "The 
hour of Christ's death,*^ says Blair 
(vol. i. ser. 5.) "was the most critical, 
the most pregnant with great events, 
since hours had begun to be numbered, 
since time had begun to iim. It was 
the hour in ivhick Christ vjas glorified 
bij his sufferings. Through the cloud 
of his humiliation his native lustre often 
broke forth, but never did it shine so 
bright as now. It was indeed the hour 
' of distress, and of blood. It is distress 
which ennobles every great cliaracter, 
and distress was to glorify tlie Son of 
God. He was now to teach all man- 
kind, by his example, how to suffer, and 
how to die. What magnanimity in all his 



words and actions on this great occa- 
sion ! No upbraiding, no complaining 
exjjression escaped fi-om his lips. He 
betrayed no symptom of a weak, a 
discomposed, or impatient mind. With 
all the dignity of a sovereign, he con- 
ferred pardon on a penitent fellow-suf- 
ferer : with a greatness of mind beyond 
example, he spent his last moments in 
apologies qnd pra} crs for those who 
were shedding his blood. This was the 
hour in which Christ atoned for the .lins 
of mankind, and accomplished our eter- 
nal redemption. It was the hour when 
that great sacrifice was offered up, the 
efficacy of which reaches back to the 
first transgression of ma.n, and extends 
forward to the end of time : the hour, 
when, from the cross, as from an high 
altar, the blood was flowing which wash- 
ed away the guilt of the nations. In this 
hour the long se7-ies of prophecies, vi~ 
sions, tijjies, and figures were accom- 
plished. This was the centre in which 
they all met. You behold the law and 
the prophets standing, if we may speak 
so, at the foot of the cross, and doing 
homage. You behold Moses and Aaron 
bearing the ark of the covenant; David 
and Elijah presenting the oracle of tes- 
timony. You behold all the priests and 
sacrifices, all the rites and ordinances, 
all the types and symbols assembled to- 
gether to receive their consummation. 
This was the hour of the abolition of 
the law, and the introduction of the Gos- 
pel; the hour of terminating the old and 
beginning the new dispensation. — It is 
finished. When he uttered these words 
he changed the state of the universe. 
This was the ever-memorable point of 
time which separated tlie old and the 
new world from each other. On one 
side of the point of separation you be- 
hold the law, with its priests, its sacri- 
fices, and its rites, retiring from sight. 
On the other side you behold the Gos- 
pel, with its simple and venerable in- 
stitutions, coming forward into view. 
Significantly was the veil of the temple 
rent in twain; for the gloiy then de- 
parted from between the cherubims. 
The legal high priest delivered up his 
Urim and Thummim, his breast-plate, 
his robes, and his incense ; and Christ 
stood forth as the great high priest of 
all succeeding generations. Altars on 
which the fire had blazed for ages were 
now to smoke no more. Xow it was 
also that he threw down the wall of 
pai-tition which had so long divided the 
Gentile from the Jew; and gathered 
into one all the faithful, out of every 
kindred and people. This was the hour 
of Christ's triumph overall the powers

of darkness ; the hour in which he | 
overthrew dominions and thrones, led 
captivity captive, and gave gifts unto 
men; then it was that the foundation of 
every pagan temple shook ; the statue 
of eveiy false god tottered on its base ; 
the priest fled from his falling shrine, 
and the heathen oracles became dumb 
for ever ! — Thk was the hournvhen our 
Lord erected tfuit sjiiritual kingdom 
•which is never to end. His enemies 
imagined that in this hour they liad suc- 
cessfully accomplished their plan for his 
desti-uction ; but how little did they 
know that the Almighty was at that 
moment setting him as a king on the 
liill of Sion ! How little did they know 
that their badges of mock royalty were 
at that moment converted into the sig- 
nals of absolute dommion, and the in- 
stniments of irresistible power ! The 
reed which they put into his hands be- 
came a 7-od oj iroT7, with which he vras 
to break in jjieces his enemies ; a scep- 
tre with winch he was to nile the uni- 
verse in righteousness. The cixiss, 
■which they thought was to stigmatize 
him with infamj-, became the ensign of 
his renown. Instead of being the re- 
proach of his followers, it was to be 
their boast, and their gloiy. The cross 
■was to shine on palaces and churches 
throughout the earth. It was to be as- 
sumed as the distinction of the most 
powerful monarchs, and to wave in the 
oanner of victorious armies, when the 
memory of Herod and Pilate should be 
accursed ; when Jerusalem should be 
reduced to ashes, and the Jews be va- 
gabonds over all the world." See 
Atonemknt ; Pearson and Barrow 
on the Creed; Owen's Death of Death 
■in the Death of Christ; Charnock's 
Works, vol. ii. on the jYecessity, Folun- 
rariness, Isfc. of the Death of Christ. 

DECALOGUE, the ten command- 
ments given by (iod to Moses. 

The ten commandments were en- 
graved by God on two tables of stone. 
The Jews, by way of eminence, call these 
commandments the ten words, from 
whence they had afterwards the name 
of decalogue ; but they joined the first 
and second into one, and di^'ided the last 
into two. They understand that against 
stealing to relate to the stealing of men, 
or kidnapping ; alleghig, that the steal- 
ing one another's goods or property is 
forbidden in the last commandment. 
The church of Rome has struck the se- 
cond commandment quite out of the de- 
calogue ; and, to make their immber 
complete, has split the tenth into two. 
The reason is obvious. 
DECEIT consists in passing any 



thing upon a person for what it is not, as 
when falsehood is made to pass for truth. 
See Hypocrisy. 

DECEPTION, SELF. See Self- 
Dkception. 

DECLAMATION, a speech made 
in public in the tone and manner of an 
oration, uniting the expression of action 
to the propriety of pronunciation, in or- 
der to give the sentiment its fidl im- 
pression on the mind. It is used also in 
a derogatory sense ; as when it is said, 
such a speech was mere declamation, it 
implies that it was deficient in point of 
i-easoning, or had more sound than sense. 

Declamation of the Pulpit. 
" The dignity and sanctitv of the place, 
and the importance of the subject, re- 
quire the preacher to exert the utmost 
powei^ of his voice^ to produce a pro- 
! nunciation that is perfectly distinct and 
I harmonious, and that he observe a de- 
I portment and action which is expressive 
and graceful. The preacher should not 
I'oar like a common crier, and i-end the 
ear with a voice like thunder ; for such 
kind of declamation is not only without 
meaning and without persuasion, but 
highly incongruous with the meek and 
gentle spirit of the Gospel. He should 
likewise take particular care to avoid 
a monotony ; his voice should rise from 
the beginning, as it were, by degrees, 
and its gi-eatest strength should be ex- 
erted in the application. Each inflexion 
of the voice should be adapted to the 
phrase and to the meaning of the words ; 
and eacl\ remarkable expression should 
have its peculiar inflexion. The dog- 
matic requires a plain uniform tone of 
voice only, and the menaces of God's 
word demand a greater force than its 
promises and rewards ; but the latter 
should not be pronounced in the soft 
tone of a flute, nor the former with the 
loud sour.d of a trumpet. The voice 
should still retain its natural tone in all 
its various inflexions. Happy is that 
preacher who has a voice that is at once 
strong, flexible, and harmonious. An 
air of complacency and benevolence, as 
well as devotion, should be constantly 
visible in the countenance of the preach- 
er ; but every appearance of affectation 
must l)e carefully avoided ; for nothing 
is so disgustful to an audience as even 
the semblance of dissimulation. E}'es 
constantly rolling, turned towards hea- 
ven, and streaming with tears, rather 
denote a hypocrite than a man possessed 
of the real spirit of religion, and who 
feels the true import of what he 
preaches. An air of affected deyotion 
mfallibly destroys the efficacy 6f. all 
} that the preacher can say, however just 



DEC

DEC 



and important it may be. On the other 
hand, he must avoid every appearance 
of mirth or raillery, or of that cold un- 
feeling manner which is so apt to freeze 
the heart of his hearers. The body 
should in general be erect, and in a na- 
tural and easy attitude. The perpetual 
movement or contortion of the body has 
a ridiculous effect in the pulpit, and 
makes the figure of a preacher and a 
harlequin too similar ; on the other 
hand, he ought not to remain constantly 
upright and motionless like a speaking 
statue. The motions of the hands give a 
strong expression to a discourse ; but 
they should be decent, gi-ave, noble, 
and expressive. The preacher who is 
incessantly in action, who is perpetually 
clasping his hands, or who menaces with 
ii clenched fist, or counts his arguments 
on his fingers, will only excite mirth 
among his auditory. In a word, decla- 
mation is an art that the sacred orator 
should study with assiduity. The design 
of a sermon is to convince, to affect, and 
to persuade. The voice, the counte- 
nance, and the action, which arc to pro- 
duce the triple effect, are therefore ob- 
jects to which the preacher should par- 
ticularly apply himself." See Sermon. 
DECREES OF GOD are his settled 
purposes, whereby he foreordains what- 
soever comes to pass, Dan. iv. 24. Acts 
XV. 18. Eph. i. 11. This doctrine is the 
subject of one of the most perplexing 
controversies that has occurred among 
mankind ; it is not, however, as some 
think, a novel doctrine. The opinion, 
that whatever occurs in the world at 
large, or in the lot of private individuals, 
is the result of a previous and unaltera- 
ble aiTangement by that Supreme Power 
"vv'hich presides over Nature, has always 
been held by many of the vulgar, and 
has been believed by speculative men. 
The ancient stoics, Zeno and Chrysip- 

fnis, whom the Jev/ish Essenes seem to 
lave followed, asserted the existence 
of a Deity, that, acting wisely but ne- 
cessarily, contrived the general system 
of the world ; from which, by a series 
of causes, whatever is now done in it 
unavoidably results. Mahomet intro- 
duced into his Koran the doctrine of ab- 
solute predestination of the course of 
human affairs. He represented life and 
death, prosperity and adversity, and 
every event that befalls a man in this 
■world, as the result of a previous deter- 
mination of the one God who rules over 
all. Augustine and the whole of the 
earliest reformers, but especially Cal- 
vin, favoured this doctrine. It was ge- 
iierally asserted, and publicly owi'cd, 
m most of the confessioiK of faith of the |j 



reformed churclies, and particularly in. 
the church of England ; and to this, we 
may add, that it was maintained by a 
gi'eat number of divines in the last two 
centuries. 

As to the nature of these decrees, it 
must be observed that they are not the 
result of deliberation, or the Almighty's 
debating matters within himself, rea- 
soning in his own mind about the expe- 
diency or inexpediency of things, as 
creatures do ; nor are they merely ideas 
of things future, but settled determina- 
tions founded on his sovereign will and 
pleasure, Isa. xl. 14. They are to be 
considered as eternal: this is evident; 
for if God be eternal, consequently his 
purposes must be of equal duration with 
himself: to suppose otherwise, would 
be to suppose that there was a time 
when he was undetermined and muta- 
ble ; whereas no new determinations or 
after thoughts can arise in his mind, 
Job xxiii. 13, 14. — 2. They are free, 
without any compulsion, and not ex- 
cited by any motive out of himself, Rom. 
ix. 15. — 3. They are infinitely wise, dis- 
playing his glory, and promoting the 
general good, Rom. xi. 33. — 4. They 
are immutable, for this is the result of 
his being infinitely perfect ; for if there 
were the least change in God's under- 
standing, it would be an instance of im- 
perfection, Mai. iii. 6. — 5. They are 
ejrtensive or universal, relating to all 
creatures and things in heaven, earth, 
and hell, Eph. i. 11. Prov. xvi. 4. — 6. 
They are secret, or at least cannot be 
known till he be pleased to discover 
them. It is therefore presumption for 
any to attempt to enter into or judge of 
his secret purpose, or to decide upon 
what he has not revealed, Deut. xxix. 
29. Nor is an unknown or su/i/iosed de- 
cree at any time to be the rule of our 
conduct. His revealed will alone must 
be considered as the rule by which we 
are to judge of the event of things, as 
well as of our conduct at large, Rom. 
xi. 34. — 7. Lastly, they are effectual; 
for as he is infinitely wise to plan, so he 
is infinitely powerful to pei'forra : his 
counsel shall stand, end he nvill do all 
his /ileasure, Isa. xlvi. 10. 

This doctrine should teach us, 1. jid- 
miration. " He is the rock, his work is 
perfect, for all his ways are judgment ; 
a God of truth, and without iniquity ; 
just and right is he," Deut. xxxii. 4. 
— 2. Reverence. "Who would not fear 
thee, O King of nations ^ for to thee 
doth it appertain," Jcr. x. 7. — 3. Hu- 
mility. '' O the depth of the riches, both 
of the wisdom 'ind knowled^ee of God !

Decrees of Councils are the laws 
made by them to regulate the doctrine 
and pohcy of the Church. Thus the acts 
of the Christian council at Jerusalem 
are called. Acts xvi. 4. 

DECRETAL, a letter of a pope, de- 
termining some point of question in the 
ecclesiastical law. The decretals com- 
pose the second part of the canon law. 
The first genuine one, acknowledged by 
all the learned as such, is a letter of 
Pope Siricius, written in the year 385, 
to Himerus, bishop of Tarragona, in 
Spain, concerning some disorders which 
had crept into the churches of Spain. 
Gratian published a collection of decre- 
tals, containuig all the ordinances made 
bv the popes till the year 1150. Gregory 
IX. in 1227, following the example of 
Theodosius and Justinian, formed a con- 
stitution of his own, collecting into one 
body all the decisions and all the causes 
which served to advance the papal 
power; which collection of decretals 
■was called the Fentateuch, because it 
contained five books. 

DEDICATION, a religious cere- 
mony, whereby any person or thing is 
solemnly consecrated, or set apart to 
the service of God and the pmposes of 
religion. 

'\ he use of dedications is veiy ancient, 
both among the worshippers of the true 
God, and among the heathens. In the 
Scripture we meet with dedications of 
the tabernacle, altars, &amp;c. Under 
Christianity dedication is only applied 
to a church, and is properly the conse- 
cration thereof. See Consecration. 

DEFENCE. See Self-defence. 

DEFENDER OF THE FAITH, 

{Fidei Defensor,^ a peculiar title be- 
onging to the king of England ; as Ca- 
tholicus to the king of Spain, and Chris- 
(ianissimus to the king of France. 
These titles were given by the popes of 
Rome. That of Fidei Defensor was first 
confen-ed by Leo X. on king Henry 
VIII. for writing against Martin Lu- 
ther; and the bull for it bears date 
yuiiito idus, October 1521. It was af- 
terwards confirmed by Clement VH. 
But the pope, on Henry 's suppressing 
the houses of religion, at the time of the 



refoi-mation, not only deprived him of 
his title, but deposed him from his crown 
also ; though, in the 35th year of his 
reign, his title, &amp;c. was confirmed by 
parliament, and has continued to be used 
by aU his successors. Chamberlayne 
says, the title belonged to the king* of 
England before that time, and for proof 
hereof appeals to several charters grant- 
ed to the University of Oxford : so that 
pope Leo's bull was only a renovation of 
an ancient right. 

DEGRADATION, Ecclesiastical, is 
the deprivation of a priest of his dignity. 
We have an instance of it in the eighth 
century at Constantinople, in the person 
of the patriarch Constantine, who was 
made to go out of the church backwards, 
stripped of his pallium, and anathema- 
tized. In our own country, Cranmer 
was degraded bv order of the bloody 
queen Mary. They dressed him in 
episcopal robes, made only of canvas ; 
put the mitre on his head, and tlie pas- 
toral staff in his hand, and in this attire 
showed him to the people, and then 
stripped him piece by piece. 

DEISTS, a class of people whose 
distinguishing character it is, not to 
profess any particular form or system 
of religion ; but only to acknowledge 
the existence of a God, and to follow 
the light and law of Nature, rejecting 
revelation and opposing Christianity. 
The name of deists seems to have been 
first assumed, as the denomination of a 
party, about the middle of the 16th cen- 
tury, by some gentlemen in France and 
Italy, who were desirous of thus dis- 
guising their opposition to Christianity 
by a more honourable appellation than 
that of atheists. \'iret, an eminent re- 
former, mentions certain persons in his 
epistle dedicatory, prefixed to the se- 
cond volume of his Instruction Chre- 
tienne, published in 1653, who called 
themselves by a new name, that of 
deists. These, he tells us, professed to 
believe in God, but shewed no regard 
to Jesus Christ, and considered the doc- 
trine of the apostles and evangelists as 
fables and dreams. He adds, that they 
laughed at all religion, though they out- 
wardly conformed to the religion of 
those with whom they lived, or whom 
they wished to please, or feared to of- 
fend. Some, he obsei-ved, professed to 
believe the immortality of the soul ; 
others denied both this doctrine and that 
of providence. Many of them were con- 
sidered as persons of acute and subtile 
genius, and took pains in disseminating 
their notions. The deists hold, that, 
considering the multiplicity of religions, 
the numerous pretences to revelation,.

DEI 



and the precarious arguments generally 
advanced in proof thereof, the best and 
surest way is to return to the simplicity 
of nature, and the belief of one God ; 
•which is the only trutli agreed to by all 
nations. They complain, that the free- 
dom of thinking and reasoning is op- 
pressed under the yoke of religion, and 
that the muids of "men are tyi-annized 
over, by the necessity imposed on them 
of believing inconceivable mysteries; 
and contend that nothing should be re- 
quired to be assented to or believed but 
what their reason clearly conceives. 
The distinguishing character of modern 
deists is, that they discard all pretences 
to revelation as the effects of imposture 
or enthusiasm. They profess a regard 
for natural religion, though thev are far 
from being agreed in their notions con- 
cerning it. 

They are classed by some of their own 
writers into mortal and immortal de- 
ists ; the latter acknowledging a future 
state ; and the former denying it, or re- 
presenting it as very uncertain. Dr, 
Clarke distinguishes four sorts of deists. 
1. Those who pretend to believe the 
existence of an eternal, infinite, inde- 
pendent, intelligent Being, who made 
the world, without concerning himself 
in the go\'ernment of it. — 2. Those who 
believe the being and natural provi- 
dence of God, but deny the diffei-ence 
of actions as morally good or evil, re- 
solving it into tlie arbitrary constitution 
of human laws ; and therefore they sup- 
pose tliat God takes no notice of them. 
With respect to both these classes, he 
observes that their opinions can con- 
sistently terminate in nothing but down- 
right atheism. — 3. Tliose who, having 
right apprehensions conceraing the na- 
ture, attributes, and all-governing pro- 
vidence of God, seem also to have some 
notion of his moral perfections ; though 
they consider them as transcendent, and 
such in nature and degree, that we can 
form no tnie judgment, nor argue with 
any certainty concerning them : but they 
deny tlie immortality of human souls; 
alleging that men perish at death, and 
that the present life is the whole of hu- 
man existence. — 4. Those who believe 
the existence, perfections, and prov-i- 
dence of God, the oliligations of natural 
religion, and a state of future retribu- 
tion, on the evidence of the light of Na- 
ture, without a divine revelation ; such 
as these, he says, are tlie only tme de- 
ists : but their principles, he apprehends, 
should lead them to embrace Chris- 
tianity ; and therefore he concludes that 
there is now no consistent scheme of 
deism in the world. The first deistical 



writer of any note that appeared in this 
country was Herbert, baron of Cher- 
bury. He lived and wrote in the se- 
venteenth century. His book De Veri- 
tate was first published at Paris in 1624. 
This, together with his book De Causis 
Errorum, and his treatise De Relimone 
iMici, were afterwards published in Lon- 
don. His celebrated work De Religione 
Geiitiliiiyn was published at Amsterdam 
in 1663 in 'Ito., and in 1700 in 8vo. ; and 
an English translation of it Avas publish- 
ed at London in 1705. As he was one 
of the first that foi-med deism into a 
system, and asserted the sufficiency, 
uni\'ersality, and absolute perfection of 
natural religion, ■with a view to discard all 
extraordinary revelation as useless and 
needless, we shall subjoin the five fun- 
damental articles of this universal reli- 
gion. Thev are these : 1. There is one 
supreme God. — 2. That he is chiefly to 
be worshipped. — 3. That piety and vir- 
tue are the principal part of his wor- 
ship. — 4. That we must repent of our 
sins ; and if we do so, (iod will pardon 
them. — 5. That there are rewards for 
good inen and punishments for bad men, 
both here and hereafter. A number of 
advocates ha\'e appeared in the same 
cause ; and however they may have 
differed among themselves, they have 
been agreed in their attempts of invali- 
dating tlie evidence and authority of di- 
vine revelation, \^'e might mention 
Hobbes, Blount, Toland, Collins, Wool- 
ston, Tindall, Morgan, Chubb, lord Bo- 
lingbroke, Hume, Gibbon, Paine, and 
some add lord Shaftesbury to the num- 
ber. Among foreigners, \ oltaire, Rous- 
seau, Condorcet, and many other cele-

C^ HRTST. 

DELUGE, the flood which over- 
flowed and destroyed the earth. This 
flood makes one of the most considera- 
ble epochas in chi-onology. Its history 
is given by Moses, Gen. vi. and vii. 
Its time is fixed by the best chronologers 
to the year from the creation 1656, 
answering to the year before Christ 
2293. From this flood, the state of the 
world is divided into diluvian andcn/e- 
diluvian. 

Men who have not paid that regard 
to sacred history as it deserves, have 
cavilled at the account given of an uni- 
versal deluge. Their objections princi- 
pally turn upon three points: 1. The 
want of anv direct history of that event 
bv the pi'ofane wi-iters ot antiquity. — 2. 
The apparent impossibility of account- 
ing for the quantity of water necessary 
to overflow the whole earth to such a 
depth as it is said to have been. — And, 
3. There appearing no necessity for an 
universal deluge, as the same end might 
have been accomplished by a partial 
one. 

To the above arguments we oppose 
the plain declarations of Scripture. God 
declared to Noah that he was resolved 
to destroy every thing tliat had breath 
under heaven, or had life on the earth, 
by a flood of waters ; such was the 
threatening, such was the execution. 
The waters, Moses assures us, covered 
the whole earth, buried all the moun- 
tains ; every thing perished therein that 
had life, excepting Noah and those v/ith 
him in the ark. Can an universal de- 
luge be more clearly expressed ? If the 
deluge had only been partial, there had 
been no necessity to spend an hundred 
years in the building of an ark, and 
shutting up all sorts of animals therein, 
in order to re-stock the world: they 
had been easily and readily brought 
from those parts of the world not o\'er- 
flowed into those that were ; at least, 
all the birds never would have been de- 
stroyed, as Moses says they were, so 
long as they had wing's to bear them to 
those parts where the flood did not 
reach. If the waters had only over- 
flowed the nei^bourhood of the Eu- 
phrates and theTigris, they could not be 
fifteen cubits above the highest moun- 
tains; there was no rising that height 
but they r.aist spread themselves, by the 
laws ot gravity, over the rest oftlie 



earth ; unless perhaps they had beea 
retained there by a miracle ; in that 
case, Moses, no doubt, would have re- 
lated the mii-acle, as he did that of the 
waters of the Red Sea, &amp;c. It may also 
be observed, that in regions far remote 
from the Euphrates and Tigris, viz. 
Italy, France, Switzerland, Germany, 
England, 8cc. thtre are frequently found 
in places many scores of leagues fi-om 
the sea, and even in the tops of high 
mountains, whole trees sunk deep under 
ground, as also teeth and bones of ani- 
mals, fishes entire, sea-shells, ears of 
corn, &amp;c. petrified ; which the best 
naturalists are agreed could never have 
come there but by the deluge. That 
the Greeks and western nations had 
.some knowledge of the flood, has never 
been denied ; and the Mussulmen, Chi- 
nese, and Americans, have traditions 
of the deluge. The ingenious Mr. 
Bryant, in his Mythology, has pretty 
clearly proved that the deluge, so far 
from being unknown to the heathen 
world at large, is in reality conspicuous 
throughout e\'ery one of their acts of 
religious worship. In India, also. Sir 
William Jones has discovered, that in 
the oldest mythological books of that 
conntr}', there' is such an account of the 
deluge, as corresponds sufficiently with 
that of Moses. 

Vai-ious have been the conjectures of 
learned men as to the natural causes of 
the deluge. Some have supposed that 
a quantity of water was created on pur- 
pose, and at a proper time annihilated 
by I)ivine power. Dr. Burnet supposes 
I the primitive earth to have been no 
moi'e than a crust investing the water 
contained in the ocean ; and in the cen- 
tral abyss which he and others suppose 
to exist in the bowels of the earth at 
the time of the flood, this outward crust 
broke in a thousand pieces, and sunk 
down among the water, which thus 
spouted up in vast cataracts, and over- 
flowed the whole sui'face. Others, sup- 
posing a sufficient fund of water in the 
sea or abyss, think that the shifting of 
the eai'th's centre of gravity drew after 
it the water out of the channel, and 
overwhelmed the several parts of the 
earth 'successi\ely. Others ascribe it to 
the shock of a comet, and Mr. King sup- 
poses it to arise from subterraneous fires 
bursting forth with great violence uudei- 
the sea. But are not most, if not all 
these h)-potheses quite arbitrary, and 
without foundation from the words of 
Moses ? It is, perhaps, in vain to attempt 
accounting for this event by natural 
causes, it being altogether miraculous 
and supernatural, as a punishment to

men for, the con-upticn then iji the 
world. Let us be satisfied Avith the 
sources which Moses gives us, namely, 
the fountains of the great deep broken 
up, and the windows of heaven opened ; 
that is, the waters nished out from the 
liidden abyss of the boAvels of the earth, 
and the clouds poured down their rain 
incessantly. Let it suffice us to know, 
that all tfie elements are under God's 
power ; that he can do with them as he 
pleases, and frequently in ways we are 
Ignorant of, in order to accomplish his 
•wn purposes.

ant, Burnet, JVhiston, Stillingjleet, King,

DEPRAVITY, corruption, a change 
from perfection to imperfection. See 
Fall, Sin. 

DEPRECATORY, a term applied to 
the manner of performing some cere- 
monies in the foiTU of prayer. The form 
of absolution in the Greek church is de- 
precative, thus expressed — Alay God 
absolve you ; whereas in the Latin 
church it is declarative — I absolve you. 
DESCENT of Christ into Hell. See 
Hell. 

DESERTION, a term made use of 
to denote an unhappy state of mind, oc- 
casioned by the sensible influences of 
the divine favour being withdrawn. 
Some of the best men in all ages have 
suffered a temporary suspension of di- 
vine enjoyments, Job xxix. 2. Ps. li. Is. 
xlix. 14. Lam. iii. 1. Is. i. 10. The 
causes of this must not be attributed to 
the Almighty, since he is always the 
same, but must arise from ourselves. 
Neglect of duty, improper views of Pro- 
vidence, self-confidence, a worldly spi- 
rit, lukewarmness of mind, inattention 
to the means of grace, or open trans- 
gression, may be considered as leading 
to this state. As all things, however, 
are under the divine control, so even 
desertion, or, as it is sometimes express- 
ed in Scripture, " the hidings of God's 
face," may be useful to excite humility, 
exercise faith and patience, detach us 
from the world, prompt to more vigorous 
action, bring us to look more to God as 
the fountain of happiness, conform us to 
his word, and increase our desires for 
that state of blessedness which is to 
come. Hervey's Ther. and jlsp. dial, 
xix.; Watts's Medit. on Job, xxiii. 3.; 
Lambert's Ser. vol. i. ser. 16.; Flavel's 
Works, vol. i. p. 167. folio. 

DESIRE is an eagerness to obtain or 
enjoy an object which we suppose to be j 
good. Those desires, says Dr. Watts, I 
that arise without any express ideas of i 



the goodness or agi-e(^blenesS of thcii' 
object to tlie mind beforehand, such as 
hunger, thirst, &amp;c.; are called c/i/ze/Zies, 
Those Avhich arise from our perception 
or opinion of an object as good or agree- 
able, are most properly called fiassions. 
Sometimes both these are united. If 
our desire to do or receive good be not 
violent, it is called a simple inclination 
or propensity. When it rises high, it is 
termed longing: when our desires set 
our active powers at work to obtain the 
very same good, or the same sort of 
good, which another desires, it is called 
emulation. Desire of pleasures of sense, 
is called sensuality; of honour, is called 
ambition; of riches, covetousness. The 
objects of a good man's desires are, that 
God may be glorified, his sins forgiven, 
and subdued, his affections enlivened 
and placed on God as the supreme ob- 
ject of love, his afflictions sanctified, 
and his life devoted to the service of 
God, Prov. xi. 23. Ps. cv. 19. 

DESPAIR, the loss of hope; that 
state of mind in which a person loses 
his confidence in the divine mercy. 

Some of the best antidotes against de- 
spair, says one, may be taken from the 
consideration, 1. Of the nature of God, 
his goodness, mercy, &amp;c. — 2. The tes- 
timony of Ciod: he hath said, he de- 
sireth not the death of the sinner. — 3. 
From the works of God : he hath given 
his Son to die. — 4. From his promises, 
Heb. xiii. 5. — 5. From his command: 
he hath commanded us to confide in his 
mercy. — 6. From his expostulations,

DESTRUCTIONISTS, those whb 
believe that the final punishment threat- 
ened in the Gospel to the wicked and 
impenitent consists not in an eternal 
preservation in misery and torment, but 
m a total extinction of bein^, and that 
the sentence of annihilation shall be ex- 
ecuted with more or less torment, pre- 
ceding or attending the final period, in 
proportion to the greater or less guilt 
of the criminal. 

The name assumed by this denomi- 
nation, like those of many others, takes 
for granted the question in dispute, viz. 
that the Scripture word destruction 
means annihilation : in strict propriety 
of speech, thev should be called jin7ii- 
hilationists. The doctrine is largely 
maintained in the sermons of Mr. Sa- 
muel Bourn, of Birmingham ; it was held 
also by Mr. J. N. Scott ; Mr. John Taylor, 
of Norwich; Mr. Marsom; and many 
others.

In defence of the system, Mr. Bourn 
argues as follows: There are many pas- 
sages of Scripture in which the ultimate 
punishment to which wicked men shall 
be adjudged is defined, in the most pre- 
cise and intelligible terms, to be an ever- 
lasting destruction from the power of 
God, which is equally able to destroy 
as to preserve. So when our Saviour is 
fortifying the -minds of his disciples 
against the power of men, by an awe of 
the far greater power of God, and the 
' punishment of his justice, he express- 
eth himself thus: Fear nnt them that 
kill the body, and after that have no 
more that they can do; fear him who is 
able to destroy both soul and body in 
hell. Here he plainly proposes the de- 
struction of the soul (not its endless pain 
and misery) as the ultimate object of 
the divine displeasure, and the greatest 
object of our tear. And when he says. 
These shall po away into everlastins;' 
fiunishmcnt, but the rii^hteous into life 
eternal, it appears evident that by that 
eternal jumishment which is set in oppo- 
sition to eternal life, is not meant any 
kind of life,' however miserable, but the 
same which the apostle expresses by 
everlasting destruction from the pre- 
sence and power of the Lord. The very 
term, death, is most frequently made 
use of to signify the end of wicked men 
in another world, or the final effect of 
divine justice in their punishment. The 
wages of sin (saith the apostle) is death; 
but eternal life is the gift of God, 
through Christ Jesus our Lord. See 
also Rom. viii. 6. 

To imagine that by the term death is 
meant an eternal lite, though in a con- 
dition of extreme misery, seems, ac- 
cording to him, to be confounding all 
propriety and meaning of words. Death, 
when applied to the end of wicked men 
in a future state, he says properly de- 
notes a total extinction of life and being. 
It may contribute, he adds, to fix this 
meaning, if we observe that the state to 
"which temporal death reduces men is 
usually termed by our Saviour and his 
apostles, sleep; because from this death 
the soul shall be raised to life again : but 
from the other, which is fully and pro- 
perly death, and of which the former is 
but an image or shadow, there is no re- 
covery ; it is an eternal death, an ever- 
lasting destruction from the presence of 
the Lord, and the glory of his power. 

He next proceeds to the figures by 
which the eternal punishment of wicked 
men is described, and finds them pei- 
fectly agreeing to establish the same 
doctrine. One figin-e or comparison, 
often used, is that of combustible mate- , 



rials thrown into a fire, which will con- 
sequently be entirely consumed, if the 
fire be not quenched'. Departfrom me, 
xje cursed, into everlasting fire, prepa- 
red for the devil and his a'ngcls. The 
meaning is, a total, irrc^-ocable destruc- 
ticn : for, as the tree that bringeth not 
forth good fruit is hewn down and cast 
into the fire, and is destroyed ; as the 
useless chaff, when separated from the 
good grain, is set on fire, and, if the fire 
be not quenched, is consumed ; so, he 
thinks, it plainly appears, that the image 
of unquenchable or everlasting fire is not 
intended to signify the degree or dura- 
tion of torment, but the absolute cer- 
tainty of destruction, beyond all possi- 
bility of recovery. So the cities of So- 
dom and Gomorrah are said to have 
suffered the vengeance of an eternal 
fire; that is, they were so effectually 
consumed, or destrcn^ed, that they could 
never be rebuilt ; the phrase, eternal 
fire, signifying the irrevocable destruc- 
tion of those cities, not the degree or 
duration of the misery of the inhabitants 
who perished. 

The images of the worm that dieth 
not, arid the fire that is 7iot (juenched^ 
used in Mark ix. 43, are set m opposi- 
tion to entering into life, and intended to 
denote a period of life and existence. 

Our Saviour expressly assigns differ- 
ent degrees of future misery, in propor- 
tion to men's respective degrees of guilt, 
Luke xii. 4:7, 48. But if all wicked men 
shall suffer torments without end, how 
can any of them be said to suffer but a 
few stripes i* All degi-ees and distinc- 
tions of punishment seem swallowed 
up in the notion of never-ending or in- 
finite misery. 

Finally, death and eternal destruc- 
tion, or annihilation, is properly styled 
in the New Testament an everlasting 
punishment, as it is irrevocable and un- 
alterable for ever ; and it is most strictly 
and literally styled, ari everlasting de- 
struction from the presence of the Lord, 
and from the glory of his power. 

Dr. Edwards, in his answer to Dr. 
Chauncey, on the salvation of all men, 
says that this scheme v.'as provisionally 
retained by Dr. C. : i. e. in case the 
scheme of universal salvation should fail 
him : and therefore Dr. E., in his ex- 
amination of that work, appi'opriates 
a chapter to the consideration of it. 
Among other reasonings agamst it are 
the following: 

1. The different degrees of punish- 
ment which the wicked will suffei ac- 
cording to their works, proves tVat it 
does not consist in annihilation, which, 
admits of no degrees. 
T

2. If it be said that the punishment of 
the wicked, though it will end in anni- 
hilation, yet shall be preceded M' tor- 
ment, and that this will be of different 
degrees according to the degrees of sin ; 
it may be replied, this is malcing it to be 
compounded partly of torment, and 
partly of annihilation. The latter also 
appears to be but a small part of future 
punishment, for that alone will be in- 
flicted on the least sinner, and on ac- 
count of the least sin ; and that all punish- 
ment which will be inflicted on any per- 
son above that which is due to the least 
sin, is to consist in torment. Nay, if \'^e 
can form any idea in the present state 
of what would be dreadful or desirable 
in another, instead of its being any pun- 
ishment to be annihilated after a long 
series of torment, it must be a deliver- 
ance, to which the sinner would look 
forward with anxious desire. And is it 
credible that this was the termination 
of torment that our Lord held up to his 
disciples as an object of dread ? Can 
this be the destruction of body and soiil 
in hell .'' Is it credible that everlasting 
destruction from the presence of the 
Lord, and from the glory of his power, 
should constitute only a part, and a 
small part, of future punishment; and 
such too, as, after a series of torment, 
must, next to being made happy, be the 
most acceptable thing that could befall 
them * Can this ho. the object threatened 
by such language, as recompensing tri- 
bulation, and taking vengeance in fla- 
ming fii'e.'' 2 Thes. i. Is it possible that 
God should threaten them with putting 
an end to their miseries ? Moreover, this 
destruction is not described as the con- 
clusion of a succession of torments, but 
as taking place immediately after the 
last judgment, ^^''hen Christ shall come 
to be glorified in his saints, then shall 
the wicked be destroyed. 

3. Everlasting destruction from the 
presence of the Lord, andfroni the [{lory 
of his power, cannot mean annihilation, 
for that would be no exertion of divine 
power, but merely the suspension of 
it : for let the upholding power of God 
be withheld for one moment, and the 
whole creation would sink into no- 
thing. 

4. The punishment of wicked men 
will be the same as that of wicked an- 
gels. Matt. XXV. 41. Defiart ye cursed, 
into everlastinpr fire, pref tared for the 
dex'il and his angels. But the punish- 
ment of wicked angels consists not in 
annihilation, but torment. Such is their 
present punishment in a degree, and 
such in a gi'eater degree will be their 
punishment hereafter. They are "cast 



down to hell ;" they "believe and trem- 
ble;" they are resen'ed in chains under 
darkness, to the judgment of the great 
day ; they cried, saying, " What have 
we to do with thee ? Art thou come to 
torment us before our time ?" Could the 
devils but persuade themselves they 
should be annihilated, they would believe 
and be at ease rather than tremble. 

5. The Scriptures explain their own 
meaning in the use of such terms as 
death, destruction, &amp;c. The second 
death is expressly said to consist in being 
cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, 
and as having a part in that lake, Rev. 
XX. 14. xxi. 8 : which does not describe 
annihilation, nor can it be made to con- 
sist with it. The phrase cut him asun- 
der. Matt. xxiv. 51. is as strong as those 
of death, or destruction; yet that is 
made to consist of having their portion 
with hypocrites, where shall be weeping 
and gnashing of teeth. 

6. The happiness of the righteous does 
not consist in eternal being, but in eter- 
nal well-being; and as the punishment 
of the wicked stands every where op- 
posed to it, it must consist riot in the loss 
of being, but of well-being, and in suffer- 
ingthe contrary. 

The great Dr. Watts may be consi- 
dered, in some measure, a destniction- 
ist ; since it was his opinion that the 
children of ungodly parents who die in 
infancy are annihilated. See Annihi- 
lation, Hell; Bourn's Serjuoris ; Dr. 
Edwards on the Salvation of all Men 
strictly examined; Mams's View of 
Religions. 

DETRACTION, in the native im- 
portance of the word, signifif's the with- 
drawing or taking oft" from a thing ; and 
as it is applied to the I'eputation, it de- 
notes the impairing or lessening a man 
in point of fame, rendering him less va- 
lued and esteemed by others.^ Dr. Bar- 
row observes (Works, vol. i. ser. 19,) 
that it differs from slayider, Avhich in- 
volves an fmputation of falsehood ; from 
reviling, which includes bitter and foul 
language; and from censziring,\\h\c\v is 
of a more general purport, extending in- 
differently to all kinds of persor.s, quali- 
ties, and actions ; but detraction espe- 
cially respects worthy persons, good 
qualities, and laudable actions, the rc- 

fiutation of which it aimeth to destroy, 
t is a fault opposed to candour. 

Nothing can be more incongnious with 
the spirit of the Gospel, the example of 
Christ, the command of God, and the 
love of mankind, than a spirit of detrac- 
tion ; and yet there are many who 
never seem happy but when they are 
il employed in this woi'k : they feed and

DEVOTEE, in the primary sense of 

the word, means a person wholly given 
up to acts of piety and devotion ; but it 
is usually understood, in a bad sense, to 
denote a bigot, or superstitious person. 

DEVOTION, a religious and fervent 
exercise of some public act of religion, 
or a temper and disposition of the mind 
rightly affected with such exercises. It 
is also taken for certain religious prac- 
tices which a person makes it a mle to 
discharge regularly. "Wherever the 
vital and unadulterated spirit of Chris- 
tian devotion prevails, its Immediate ob- 
jects wUl be to adore the perfections of 
V'iod ; to entertain with reverence and 
complacence the various intimations of 
his pleasure, especially those contained 
in holy writ ; to acknowledge our abso- 
lute depend'^nce on and infinite obliga- 
tions to him ; to confess and lament the 
disorders of our nature, and the trans- 
gressions of our lives ; to implore his 
grace and mercy through Jesus Christ ; 
to intercede for our brethren of man- 
kind ; to pray for the propagation and 
establishment of truth, rigliteousness, 
and peace, on earth ; in fine, to long for 
a more entire conformity to the will of 
God, and to breathe after the everlast- 
ing enjoyment of his friendship. The 
effects of such a spirit habitually che- 
rished, and feelingly expressed before 
him must surely be important and hap- 
py. Among these may be reckoned a 
profound humility in the sight of God, 
a high veneration for his presence and 
attributes, an ardent zeal for his wor- 
ship and honour, a constant imitation of 



our Saviour's divine example, a diffusive 
chanty for men of all denominations, a 
generous and unwearied self-denial, a 
total resignation to Providence, an in- 
creasing esteem for the Gospel, with 
clearer and firmer hopes of that immor- 
tal life which it lias brought to light." 

DEUTEROCANONICAL, in the 
school theology, an appellation given to 
certain I)ooks of holy Scripture, which 
were added to the canon atter the rest, 
either by reason they were not wrote 
till after the compilation of the canon, 
or by reason of some dispute as to their 
canonicity. The woi-d is Greek, being 
compounded of SeuteJoi, second; and 
xavovixot, canonical. 

The Jews, it is certain, acknowledged 
several books in their canon, which were 
put there later than the rest. They say 
that under Esdras, a great assembly of 
their doctors, which they call, by way 
of eminence, the ^/ra^ synagogue, made 
the collection of the sacred oooks which 
we now have in the Hebrew Old Tes- 
tament ; and they agree that they put 
books therein which had not been so ue- 
fore the Babylonish captivity; such as 
those of Daniel, Ezekiel, Haggai, &amp;c. 
and those of Esdras and Nehemiah. 
And the Romish church has since added 
othei-s to the canon, that were not, and 
could not be, in the canon of the Jews, 
by reason some of them were not com- 
posed till after: such as the book of Ec- 
clesiasticus, with several of the apocry- 
phal books, as the Maccabees, Wisdom, 
&amp;c. Others were added still later, by 
reason their canonicity had not been yet 
examined; and till such examen and 
judgment they might be set aside at 
pleasure. But since that church has 
pronounced as to the canonicity of those 
books, there is no more room now for 
her members to doubt of them, than 
there was for the Jews to doubt of those 
of the canon of Esdras. And the deu- 
terocanonical books are with them as 
canonical as the proto-canonical ; the 
only difference between them consisting 
in this, that the canonicity of the one 
was not generally known, examined, and 
settled, as soon as that of the others. 
The deuterocanonical books in the 
modern canon are, the book of Esther, 
either the v hole, or at least the seven 
last chapters thereof; the epistle to the 
Hebrews; that of James, and that of 
Jude ; the second of St. Peter, the se- 
cond and third of St. John, and the Re- 
velation. The deuterocanonical parts of 
books are, the hymn of the thi-ee chil- 
dren ; the praver of Azariah ; the his- 
tories of Susannah, of Bel and the Dra- 
gon; the last chapter of St. Mark; the

DIET, an assembly of the states of 
Germany. We shall only take notice, 
in this place of the more remai'kable 
of those which have been held on the 
affairs of religion. 1. The diet of Augs- 
burgh, in the year 1530, was assembled 
to re-unite the princes of the empire, in 
relation to some religious matters. The 
emperor himself presided in this assem- 
bly with the greatest magnificence ima- 
ginable. The elector of Saxony, follow- 
ed by several princes, presented the 
confession cf faith, called the confession 
of Augsburgh. The emperor ended the 
diet with a decree, that no alteration 
should be made in the doctrines and ce- 
remonies of the Romish church till the 
council should order it otherwise. — 2. 
The diet of Augsburgh, in 15'i7, was 
held on account of the electors being 
divided concernmg the decisions of the 
council of Trent. The emperor de- 
manded that the management of that 
affair should be referred to him ; and it 
•was I'esolved, that every one should con- 
form to the decisions of the council. — 
.3. The diet of Augsburgh, in 1548, was 
assembled to examine some memorials 
relating to the confession of faith ; but, 
the commissioners not agreeing toge- 
ther, the emperor named three divines, 
■who drew the design of this famous in- 
terim, so v/ell known in Germany and 
elsewhere. See Interim. — 4. The diet 
of Augsburgh, in 1550. In this assem- 
bly, the emperor complained that the 
interim was not obsei'ved, and demanded 
that all should submit to the council, 
which they "were going to renew at 
Trent ; which submission was resolved 
upon bv a plurality of votes. — 5. The 
diet of Nui'emberg, in 1523. Here pope 
Adrian Vlth's nuncio demanded the 
execution of Leo Xth'sbuU, and Charles 
Yth's edict against Luther. But the as- 
sembly drew up a list of grievances, 
which were reduced to an hundred ar- 
ticles, some whereof aimed at the de- 
struction of the pope's authoritv, and 
the discipline of the Romish church ; 
however, they consented that the Lu- 
therans should be comm.anded not to 
write against the Roman Catholics. — 
6. The diet of Nuremberg, in 1524. In 
this assembly, the Lutherans having the j 
ad\-antage, it was decreed that the pope | 
should call a council in Germany ; but , 
tliat, in the mean time, an assemblv 
shoul'l be hell ;it Sr^i'•c, to det. .-nine 
what was to be believed and practised ; i 



but Charles V. prohibited the holding 
this assembly. — 7. The diet of Ratisbon, 
in 1541, was held for re-uniting the Pro- 
testants with the Roman Catholics. The 
emperor named three Roman Catholics 
and three Protestant divines, to agree 
upon articles. The Roman Catholics 
were, Julius Phlug, John Gropper, and 
John Eckius ; the Protestants were, 
Philip Melancthon, Martin Bucer, and 
John Pistorius ; but, after a whole 
month's consultation, they could agree 
upon no more than five or six articles ; 
which the emperor consented the Pro- 
testants should retain, forbidding them 
to solicit any body to change the ancient 
religion. — 8. The diet of Ratisbon, in 
1546, decreed that the council of Trent 
was to be followed, which was opposed 
by the Protestant deputies; and this 
caused a war against them. — 9. The diet 
of Ratisbon, in 1557, demanded a con- 
ference between some famous doctors 
of both parties ; which conference was 
held at VVorms, in September, between 
twelve Roman Catholic and twelve Lu- 
theran divines ; but was soon dissolved 
by the Lutherans being divided among 
themselves. — 10. The diet of Spire, in 
1526. In this assembly (wherein presi- 
ded the archduke Ferdinand) the duke 
of Saxony, and the landgrave of Hesse, 
demanded the free exercise of the Lu- 
theran religion : upon which it was de- 
creed, that the emperor should be de- 
sired to call a general, or national, coun- 
cil in Germany within a year, and that, 
in the mean time, every one should have 
liberty of conscience. — 11. The diet of 
Spire, in 1529, decreed, that in the 
countries which had embraced the new 
religion, it should be lawful to continue 
in it till the next council ; but that no 
Roman Catholic should be allowed to 
turn Lutheran. Against this decree six 
Lutheran princes, viz. the elector of 
Saxony, the marquis of Brandenburg, 
the two dukes of Lunenburg, the land- 
grave of Hesse, and tlie prince of An- 
halt, with the deputies of fourteen im- 
perial towns, protested in writing; from 
whi h solemn protestation came the fa- 
mous name of Protestants, which the 
Lutherans presently after took. — 12. 
The diet of Worms, in 1521. In this as- 
sembly, Luther, being charged by the 
pope's nuncio with heresy, and refusing 
to recant, the emperor, by his edict of 
May 26, before all the princes of Ger- 
manv, publiclv outlawed him. 

DIFFIDET^fCE, distrust, want of con- 
fidence in ourselves. Diffidence, says 
Dr. J'-'hns'^n, mav check resolution and

its embaiTassment by more important

advantages; it conciliates the pvoud, 
and softens the severe ; averts envy 
from excellence, and censure from mis- 
carriage. 

DIGGERS, a denomination which 
sprung up in Germany, in the fifteenth 
centurj' ; so called because they dug 
their assemblies under ground in caves 
and forests. They derided the church, 
its ministers and sacrafaen'ts. 

DILIGENCE, Christian, is constan- 
cy in the performance of all those du- 
ties enjoined us in God's sacred word. 
It includes activity and vigour — watch- 
fulness against intruding objects — firm- 
ness and resolution — patience and per- 
severance. The shortness of our time ; 
the importance of our work ; the plea- 
sure which arises from discharging du- 
ty ; the uncertainty of the time of our 
dissolution ; the consciousness we do not 
labour in vain ; together with the exam- 
ple of Christ and all good men, should 
excite us to the most unwearied dili- 
gence in the cause of God, of truth, and 
our own souls. 

DIMISSORY LETTER, a letter gi- 
ven by a bishop to a candidate for holy 
orders, having a title in his diocese, di- 
rected to some other bishop, and giving 
leave for the bearer to be ordained by 
him. 

DIOCESE, the circuit of eveiy bi- 
shop's jurisdiction. It is formed from 
the Greek Siotx-nais, government. 

DIRECTORY, a kind of regulation 
for the performance of religious wor- 
ship, drawn up by the assembly of di- 
vines in England, at the instance of the 
parliament, in 1644. It was designed to 
supply the place of the Liturgy, or Book 
of Common Prayer, the use of which 
they had abolished. It consisted of some 
general heads, which were to be mana- 
ged and filled up at discretion ; for it 
prescribed no foi-m of prayer, or cir- 
cumstances of external worship, nor 
obliged the people to any responses, ex- 
cepting Amen. The substance of it is 
as follows: — It forbids all salutations 
and civil ceremony in the churclies ; — 
the reading the scriptures in the con- 
gregation is declared to be part of the 
pastoral office ; — all the canonical books 
of the old and New Testament (but not 
of the Apocrypha) are to be publicly 
read in the vulgar tongue : how large a 
portion is to be read at once, is left to 
the minister, who has likewise the li- 
berty of expounding, when he judges it 
necessary. It prescribes heads for the 
prayer before sermon ; it delivers rules 
lor preaching the word ; the introduc- 
tion to the text must be short and clea;-, 
drawn ft-om the words or context, or 



some parallel place of Scripture. In 
dividing the text, the minister is to re- 
gard the order of the matter more than 
that of the words : he is not to burden 
the memoiy of his audience with too 
many divisions, nor perplex their un- 
derstanding with logical phrases and 
terms of arts : he is not to start unne- 
cessary' objections ; and he is to be very 
sparing in citations fiom ecclesiastical 
or other human writers, ancient or mo- 
dern, &amp;c. The Directory recommends 
the use of the Lord's Prayer, as the most 
perfect model of devotion ; it forbids 
private or lay persons to adnunister bap- 
tism, and enjoins it to be performed in 
the face of the congregation ; it oi'ders 
the communion-table at the I^ord's sup- 
per to be so placed, that the communi- 
cants may sit about it. It also orders, 
that the sabbath be kept with the great- 
est strictness, both publicly and private- 
ly ; that marriage be solemnized by a 
lawful minister of the word, who is to 
give counsel to, and pray for the jjar- 
ties ; that the sick be visited by the mi- 
nister vmder whose charge they are ; the 
dead to be buried without any prayers 
or religious ceremonies; that days of 
fasting are to be observed when the 
judgments of God are abi-oad, or when 
some important blessings are desired ; 
that days of thanksgiving for mercies 
i-eceived be also obser\ed ; and, lastly, 
that singing of Psalms together in the 
congregation is the duty of Christians. 
In an appendix to this Directory it is 
ordered, that all festivals, vulgarly call- 
ed holy days, are to l^e abolished ; that 
no day is to be kept but the Lord's day; 
and that as no place is capable of any 
holiness under pretence of consecration, 
so neither is it subject to pollution by 
any superstition formerly used ; and 
therefore it is held requisite, that the 
places of public worship now used 
should still be continued and employed. 
Should the reader be desirous of peru- 
sing this Directoiy at large, he may 
find it at the end of jVeale's History of 
the Puritans. 

DISCIPLE, a scholar or one who at- 
tends the lectures, and professes the te- 
nets of another. A discifile of Christ is 
one who believes his doctrines, imbibes 
his spirit, and follows his example. See 
Christian. 

DISCIPLINE, Church, consists in 
putting church laws in execution, and 
inflicting the penalties enjoined. See

ry of the church of Scotland, is a com-

and uniformity to be observed in the dis- 
cipline and policy of the Church. In this 
book the government of the church by 
pi-elates is set aside ; kirk sessions are 
established; the superstitious observa- 
tion of fast days and saint days is con- 
demned, and other regulations for the 
government of the church are deter- 
mined. This book was appro\-ed by 
the pi'ivy council, and is called the first 
book of discipline. 

DISCONTENT, uneasiness at our 
present state. 

Man never appears in a worse light 
than when he gives way to this disposi- 
tion. It is at once the strongest proof of 
his pride, ignorance, unbelief, and re- 
bellion agamst God. Let such remem- 
ber, that discontent is a reflection on 
God's government ; that it cannot alter 
the state of things, or make them bet- 
ter; that it is the source of the greatest 
miserv ; that it is an absolute violation 
of God's law, Heb. xiii. 5 ; and that God 
has often punished it with the most sig- 
nal judgments. Numb. xi. Ps. cvii. See 
Contentment. 

DISCRETION, prudent behaviour, 
arising from a knowledge of and acting 
agreeable to the difference of things. 
"There are," says Addison, No. 225, 
Spect. " many more shining qualities in 
the mind of man, but there is noue so 
useful as discretion : it is this, indeed, 
•which gi\cs a value to all the rest ; 
which sets them at work in their pro- 
per times and places, and turns them to 
the advantage of the person who is pos- 
sessed of them. Without it, learning is 
pedantiy, ard wit impertinence ;*virtue 
itself looks like weakness : the best parts 
onl)^ qualify a man to be more sprightly 
in en-ors, and active to his own preju- 
dice. 

" Discretion is a veiy different thing 
from cunning: cunning is only an ac- 
complishment of little, mean, ungene- 
rous minds. Discretion points out the 
noblest ends to us, and pursues the most 
proper and laudable methods of attain- 
ing them ; cunning has only private sel- 
fish aims, and sticks at nothing which 
may make them succeed. Discretion 
has large and extended views, and, like 
a well formed eye, commands a whole 
horizon; cunning is a kind of short- 
sightedness tliat discovers the minutest 
objects which are near at hand, but not 
able to discern things at a distance. Dis- 
cretion, the more it is discovered, gives 
a gi-eater authority to the person who 
possesses it ; cunning, when it is once 
detected, loses its force, and makes a 
man incapable of bringing about even 
those events which he might have done, 



had he passed only for a plain man. 
Discretion is the perfection of reason, 
and a guide to us in all the duties of life ; 
cunning is a kind of instinct, that only 
looks out after our immediate interest 
and welfare. Discretion is only found in 
men of strong sense and good under- 
standings ; cunning is often to be met 
with in binites themselves, and in per- 
sons who are but the fewest remo\^es 
from them. In short, cunning is only the 
mimic of discretion, and may pass upon 
weak men, in the same manner as viva- 
city is often mistaken for wit, and gra- 
vity for wisdom." See Prudence. 

DISDAIN, contempt, as unworthy of 
one's choice. It is distinguished from 
haughtiness thus: Haaghtmefis is foun- 
ded on the high opinion we have of our- 
selves; disdain on the low opinion we 
have of others. 

DISINTERESTED LOVE. See 
Self-love. 

DISPENSATION, the act of deal- 
ing out any thing. The two diffi-rent 
methods of revealing the truths of the 
Gospel before and after Christ's death 
are called the Old and New Testament 
Dispensation. The dealing of God with 
his creatures in his pro\'idence is called 
a dispensation. The state of supernatu- 
ral or revealed theology may also be di- 
A'ided into six dispensations. 1. From 
the fall of Adam to the flood. — 2. From 
Noah to the giving the law. — 3. From 
that time to the time of David and the 
prophets. — 4. From David to the Baby- 
lonish captivity. — 5. The period from 
that, to the time of Christ, finishes the 
Old Testament dispensation. — 6. From 
Clirist to the end of time, the Gospel 
dispensation. The superiority of the last 
dispensation, as Dr. \^''atts oljserves, ap- 
pears, if we consider that it contains the 
fairest and fullest representation of the 
moral law ; and which is more particu- 
larly explained here than in any of the 
former dispensations. — 2. In this dispen- 
sation the Gospel or covenant of grace 
is revealed more perfectly and plainly 
than ever before ; not in obscure ex- 
pressions, in types and carnal meta- 
phors, 1)ut in its own proper form and 
language. — 3. The rites and ceremonies 
under this dispensation are preferable to 
those in former times, and that in this 
respect: they are fewer, clearer, and 
much more easy. — 4. The Son of God, 
who was the real mediator throug)i all 
foiTner dispensations, has condescended 
to become the visible mediator of this 
dispensation. — 5. This dispensation is 
not confined to one family, or to one na- 
tion, or to a few ages of men, but it 
spreads through all the nations of the 



DIS 



151 



DIS 



earth, and reaches to the end of time. — 
6. The encouragements and persuasive 
helps which Christianity gives us to ful- 
fil the duties of the covenant, are much 
superior to those which were enjoyed 
under any of the former dispensations.

DISPERSION of mankind was oc- 
casioned by the confusion of tongues at 
the overthrow of Babel, Gen. xi. 9. As 
to tlie manner of the dispersion of the 
posterity of Noah from the plain of Shi- 
nar, it was undoubtedly conducted witli 
the utmost regularity and order. The ! 
sacred historian informs us, that they 
were divided in their lands : eveiy one, 
according to his tongue, accca'ding to his 
family, and according to his nation, Gen. 
X. 5, 20, 31. The ends of this disfiersion 
were to populate the earth, to prevent j 
idolatry, and to display the divme wis- ' 
dom and power. See Confusion of ] 

TONGUF.S. 

DISPOSITION, that temper of mind, 
which any person possesses. 

In every man, says lord Kaims, there 
is somethmg original that serves to dis- 
tinguish him from others, that tends to 
form a character, and to make him 
meek or fieiy, candid or deceitful, reso- 
lute or timorous, cheerful or morose. 
This original bent, termed disposition, 
must be distinguished from a princi/ile: 
the latter signifying a law of human 
nature makes part of the common na- 
ture of man ; the former makes part of 
the nature of this or that man. 

DISPUTATION, Religious, is the 
agitation of any religious question, in 
order to obtain clear and adequate ideas 
of it. The propriety of religious dispu- 
tation or controversial divinity has been 
a matter of doubt with many. Some art- 
fully decry it, in order to destroy free 
inquiiy. Some hate it, because they do 
not like to be contradicted. Others de- 
claim against it, to save themselves the 
disgrace of exposing their ignorance, or 
the labour of examining and defending 
their own theses. There are others 
who avoid it, not because they are con- 
vinced of the impropriety of the thing 
itself, but because of the evil temper 
with which it is generally conducted. 

The propriety of it, however, will ap- 
pear, if^ we consider that every article 
of religion is denied by some, and can- 
not well be believed without examina- 
tion, by any. Religion empowers us to 
investigate, debate, and controvert each 
article, in order to ascertain the evi- 
dence of its timth. The divine writings, 
many of them, are controversial; the 



book of Job, and Paul's epistles, espe- 
cially. The ministry of our Lord was 
a pei-petual controversy, and the apos- 
tles came at tiiith by much disputing. 
Acts XV. 7. xvii. 17. xix. 8. To attend, 
however, to religious controversy with 
advantage, the following rules should be 
observed; 1. The question should be 
cleared from all doubtful terms and 
needless additions. — 2. The precise point 
of enquiry should be fixed. — 3. That the 
object aimed at be truth, and not the 
mere love of victory. — 4. Beware of 
a dogmatical spirit, and a supposition 
that you are always right. — 5. Let a 
strict rein be kept on the passions when 
you are hard pushed. Vide Robinson's 
Claude, p. 245, vol. ii ; Watts on the 
Mind, chap. 10. ; Beattie on Truth, 347, 
Sec. ; Locke on the Understajiding, chap. 
10. vol. iii. 

DISSENTERS, those who separate 
from the established church. The num- 
ber of dissenters in this kingdom is very 
considerable. They are divided into 
several parties ; the chief of which are 
the Presbyterians, Independents, Bap- 
tists, Quakers, and Methodists. See 
those articles, as also Nonconformists 
and Puritans. 

DISSIDENTS, a denomination ap- 
plied in Poland to those of the Luthe- 
ran, Calvinistic, and Greek profession. 
The king of Poland engages by the 
pacta conventa to tolerate them in the 
free exercise of their religion, but they 
have often had reason to complain of 
the violation of these promises. 

DISSIMULATION, the act of dis- 
sembling. It has been distinguished 
from simulation thus: Si?nulation is 
making a thing appear which does not 
exist ; dissimulation is keeping that 
which exists from appearing. Moralists 
have observed that all dissimulation is 
not hypocrisy. A vicious man, who 
endeavours to throw a veil over his bad 
conduct, that he may escape the notice 
of men, is not in the strictest sense of 
the word a hypocrite, since a man is no 
more obliged to proclaim his secret 
vices than any other of his secrets. The 
hypocrite is one who dissembles for a 
bad end, and hides the snare that he 
may be more sure of his prey ; and, not 
content with a negative virtue, or not 
appearing the ill man he is, makes a 
show of positive virtue, and appears the 
man he is not. See Hypocrisy. 

DISSOLUTION, death, or the se- 
paration of the body and soul. The 
aissolutioji of the world is an awful 
event, v/hich we have reason to believe, 
both from the Old Testament and the 
New, will certainly take place. 1. It is

not an incredible thing, since nothing of 
a material nature is tormed for perpe- 
tual duration. — 2. It will doubtless be 
under the direction of the Supreme Be- 
ing, as its creation was. — 3. The soul of 
man will remain unhurt amidst this 
general desolation. — 4.. It will be an in- 
troduction to a greater and nobler sys- 
tem in the government of God, 2 Pet. 
iii. 13. — 5. The consideration of it ought 
to have a great influence on us while in 
the present state, 2 Pet. iii. 11, 12. See 
Conflagration. 

DIVERSION, something, that un- 
bends the mmd, by turning it off from 
care. It seems to be something lighter 
than amusement, and less forcible than 
pleasure. It is an old simile, and a very 
just one, that a bow kept always bent 
will grow feeble, and lose its force. The 
alternate succession of business and di- 
version preserve the body and soul in 
the happiest temper. Diversions must, 
however, be lawful and good. The 
play-house, the gaming-table, the mas- 
querade, and midnight assemblies, must 
be considered as inimical to the mo- 
. rals and true happiness of man. The 
most rational diversions are conversa- 
tion, reading, singing, music, riding, &amp;c. 
They must be moderate as to the time 
spent in them, and expense of them ; 
seasonable, when we have (as Cicero 
obsei'ves) dispatched our serious and 
important affairs. See Grove's Regula- 
tion of Diversions ; Watts' s Improve- 
ment of the Mind, vol. ii. sec. 9. Blair's 
Sevjuons, vol. ii. p. 17. Burdcr's Ser- 
mon on Amusements; Friend's Even- 
inpylmusements. 

DIVINATION, is a conjecture or 
surmise formed concerning some future 
event from something which is suppo- 
sed to be a presage of it ; but between 
which there is no real connection, only 
what the imagination of the diviner is 
pleased to assign in order to deceive. 

Divination of all kinds being the off- 
spring of credulity, nursed by imposture, 
and strengthened by superstition, was 
necessarily an occult science, retained 
in the hands of the priests and priest- 
esses, the magi, the soothsayers, the 
augurs, the visionaries, the priests of the 
oracles, the false prophets, and other 
like professors, till the coming of Jesus 
Christ, when the light of the Gospel 
dissipated much of this dai-kness. The 
vogue for these pretended sciences and 
arts is nearly past, at least in the en- 
lightened parts of the world. There 
are nine different kinds of divination 
mentioned in Scripture. These are, 1. 
Those whom Moses calls Meonen of 
Anan, a cloud, Deut. x\nii. 10. — 2. Those 



whom the prophet calls, in the same 
place, Minachesch, which the Vulgate 
and generalitv of interpreters render 
Augur. — 3. I'hose who in the same 
place arc called JMrcaschcfih, which 
the Septuagint and Vulgate translate 
"a man given to ill practices." — 4. 
Those whom in the same chapter, ver. 
11. he calls Hhober. — 5. Those who 
consult the spirits, called Python. — 6. 
Witches, or magicians, called Judeoni. 
— 7. J\''ecromanc€rs, who consult the 
dead. — 8. Such as consult staves, Hosea, 
iv. 12. called by some Jihabdomancy. — ■ 

9. Hejiatoscopy, or the consideration of 
the liver. 

Different kinds of divination which 
have passed for sciences, Ave have had : 

1. Aeromancy, divining by the air. — 

2. AstrologA% by the heavens. — 3. Au- 
gury, by the flight and singing of birds, 
&amp;c. — 4. Chiromancy by inspecting the 
hand. — 5. Geomancy, by observing of 
cracks or clefts in the earth. — 6. Ha- 
ruspicy, by inspecting the bowels of ani- 
mals. — 7. Horoscopy, a branch of asti-o- 
logy, marking the position of the heavens 
when a man is bom. — 8. Hydromancy, 
by water. — 9. Physiognomy, by the 
countenance. (This, however, is consi- 
dered by some as of a different nature, 
and worthy of being rescued from the 
rubbish of superstition, and placed 
among the useful sciences. Lavater has 
written a celebrated treatise on it.)— . 

10. Pvromancy, a divination made by 
fire. Thus we see what arts have been 
practised to deceive, and how designing 
men have made use of all the four ele- 
ments to impose upon weak minds. 

DIVINE, sometning relating to God. 
The word is also used figurativelv for 
any thing that is excellent, extraordi- 
nary, and that seems to go beyond the 
power of nature and the capacity of 
man. It also signifies a minister, or cler- 
gyman. See Minister. 

DIVINITY, the science of theology. 
See Theology. 

DIVISIONS, ECCLESIASTICAL. 
See Schism. 

DIVORCE, is the dissolution of mar- 
riage, or separation of man and wife. 
Divorce a mensa et thoro, i. e. from bed 
and board, — in this case the wife has a 
suitable maintenance allowed her out of 
her husband's effects. Divorce a vin- 
culo matrimonii, i. e. from the bonds of 
matrimony, is strictly and properly di- 
vorce. This happens either m conse- 
quence of criminality, as in the case of 
adultery, or through some essential im- 
pediment ; as consanguinity, or affinity 
within the degrees forbidden, pre-con- 
tract, impotency, &amp;c. of Avhich impedi-

ments the canon law allows no less 
than 14. In these cases the woman 
i-eceives again only what she brought. 
Sentences which release the parties a 
vmculo matrimonii, on account of im- 
puberty, frigidity, consanguinity within 
the prohibited degrees, prior marriage, 
or want' of the I'equisite consent of pa- 
rents or guardians, are not properly 
dissolutions of the marriage contract, 
but judicial declarations that there ne- 
ver was any marriage ; such impedi- 
ment subsisting at the time as I'endered 
the celebration of the marriage rite a 
mere nullity. And the rite itself con- 
tains an exception of these impedi- 
ments. 

The law of Moses, says Dr. Paley, 
for reasons of local expediency, per- 
mitted the Jewish husband to put away 
his wife ; but whether for every cause, 
or for what cause, appears to liave been 
controverted amongst the intei'preters 
of those times. Christ, the precepts of 
whose religion were calculated for more 
general use and observation, revokes his 
permission as given to tlie Jews for 
their hardness of heart, and promulges 
a law which was thenceforward to 
confine divorces to the single cause of 
adultery in the wife. Matt. xix. 9. In- 
ferior causes may justify the separation 
of husband and wife, although they will 
not authorize such a dissolution of the 
mari'iage contract as would leave either 
at liberty to marry again ; for it.js that 
liberty in which the danger and mis- 
chief of di^'orces principally consist. 
The law of this country, in conformity 
to our Saviour's injunction, confines the 
dissolution of the marriage contract to 
the single case of adultery in the wife ; 
and a divorce even in that case can only 
be brought about by an act of parlia- 
ment, founded upon a previous senti- 
ment in the spiritual court, and a \ er- 
dict against the adulterer at common 
law ; which proceedings taken together, 
compose as complete an investigation 
of the complaint as a cause can i-eceive.

DOCETiE, the followers of Julius 
Cassianus, one of the Valentinian sect, 
towards the close of the second cen- 
tury. They believed and taught that 
the actions and sufferings of Jesus Christ 
were not in reality, but only in appear- 
ance. 

DOCTRINE, the principles or po- 
sitions of any sect or master. As the 
doctrines of the Bible are the first prin- 
ciples and the foundation of religion, 
they should be carefully examined and 
well understood. The Scriptures pre- 



sent us with a copious fund of evangelic 
truth, which, though it has not the forrtr 
of a regular system, yet its parts are 
such, that, when united, make the most 
complete body of doctrine that Ave can 
possibly have. Every Christian, but 
divines especially, should make this 
their study, because all the various doc- 
trines should be insisted on in ])ublic, 
and explained to the people. It is not, 
however, as some suppose, to fill up 
every part of a minister's sermon, but 
considered as the basis upon vvhich the 
practical part is to be built. Some of 
the divines in the last century over- 
charged their discourses with doctrine, 
especially Dr. Owen and Dr. Goodwin. 
It was common in tliat day to make 
thirty or forty remarks before the im- 
mediate consideration of the text, each, 
of which was just introduced, and which, 
if enlarged on, would have afforded 
matter enough for a whole sermon. A 
wise preacher will join doctrine and 
practice together. 

Doctrines, though abused by some, 
yet, properly considered, will influence 
the heart and life. Thus the idea of 
God's sovereignty excites submission ; 
his power and justice promote fear ; his 
holiness, humility and purity ; his good- 
ness, a ground of hope ; his love excites 
joy ; the obscurity of his providence 
requires patience ; his faithfulness, con- 
fidence, &amp;c. 

DOMINICANS, a religious order; 
in some places called Jacobins, and in 
others Predicants, or preaching friars. 
The Dominicans take their name from, 
their founder, Dominic de Guzman, a 
Spaniard, born in 1170, at Calaroga, in 
Old Castile : he was first canon and 
archdeacon of Ossuna ; and afterwards 
preached with great zeal and vehe- 
mence against the Albigenses in Lan- 
guedoc, where he laid tlie first founda- 
tion of his order. It was approved of 
in 1215 by Innocent III. and confirmed 
in 1216, by a bull of Honorius III. under 
the title oif St. jiugustin ; to which Do- 
minic added several austere precepts 
and obsei-vances, obliging the brethren 
to take a vow of absolute poverty, and 
also the title of preaching friars, be- 
cause public instiTiction was the main 
end of their institution, and to abandon 
j entirely all their revenues and posses- 
i sions. The first convent ^vas founded 
I at Thoulouse, by the bishop thereof and 
Simon de Monttbrt. I'wo years after- 
; wards they had another at Paris, near 
I the bishop's house ; and some time after,

1 James's street,) whence the denomina- 
tion of Jacobins. Just before his dciith,

Dominic sent Gilbert de Fresney, with 
twelve of the brethren, into England, 
where they founded their first monas- 
tery at Oxford, in the year 1221, and 
soon after another at London. In the 
year 1276, the mayor and aldermen of 
the city of London gave them two whole 
streets, by the river Thames, where 
they erected a very commodicjus con- 
vent ; whence that place is still called 
Blackfhars, from the name by which 
the Dominicans were called in England. 
St. Dominic at first only took the habit 
of the regular canons ; that is, a black 
cassock and rochet : but this he quitted, 
in 1219, for that which they have ever 
since worn, which, it is pretended, was 
shown by the Blessed Vu'gin herself to 
the beatified Renaud d'Orleans. This 
order has been diffused throughout the 
whole known world. They reckon 
three popes of this order, above sixty 
cardinals, several patriarchs, a hun- 
dred and fifty archbishops, and about 
eight hundred bishops, besides masters 
of the sacred palace, whose office has 
been constantly discharged by a reli- 
gious of this order ever since St. Domi- 
nic, who held it under Honorius IIL m 
1218. 

Of all the monastic orders, none en- 
joyed a higher degree of power and 
authority than the Dominican friars, 
whose credit was great, and their in- 
fluence unh'ersal. But the measures 
they used in order to maintain and ex- 
tend their authority were so perfdious 
and cruel, that their influence began to 
decline towards the beginning of the 
sixteenth century. The tragic story of 
Jetzer, conducted at Bern, in 1509,' for 
determining an uninteresting dispute 
between them and the Franciscans, re- 
lating tothe immaculate conception, will 
reflect indelible infamy on this order. 
In order to give the reader a view of 
the impious frauds which have some- 
times been can-icd on in the church of 
Rome, we shall here insert an account 
of this sti-atagem. 

The Franciscans maintained that the 
Virgin Mary was bom without the 
blemish of original sin; the Dominicans 
asserted the contrary. 

The doctrine of the Franciscans, in 
an age of darkness and superstition, 
could not but be popular; and hence 
the Dominicans lost ground from dav to 
day. To support the credit of their 
order, they resolved, at a chapter held 
at Vimpsen, in the year 1504, to have 
recourse to fictitious visions and dreams, 
in which the people at that time had 
an easy faith ; and they determined to 
make Bern the scene of their opera- 



tions. A person named Jetzer, who 
was extremely simple, and much in- 
clined to austerities, and wlio had ta- 
ken their habit as a lay-brother, was 
chosen as the instrument of the delu- 
sions they were contriving. One of the 
four Dominicans, who had undertaken 
the management of this plot, conveyed 
himself secretly into Jetzer's cell, and 
about midnight appeared to him in a 
horrid figure, surrounded with liowling 
dogs, and seeming to blow fire from hib 
nostrils, by the means of a box of com- 
bustibles which he held near his mouth. 
In this frightfiil form he approached 
Jetzer's bed, told him that he was the 
ghost of a Dominican, who had been 
killed at Pa.ris, as a judgment of Hea- 
ven for laying aside his monastic habit ; 
that he was" condemned to pui-gatory 
for this crime ; adding, at the same 
time, that by his means he ' might be 
rescued from his misery, which was be- 
yond expression. Tliis story, accom- 
panied with hoiTible cries and' bowlings, 
frighted poor Jetzer out of tlie little wits 
he had, and engaged him to promise 
to do all tliat wa-i in his power to de- 
liver the Dominican from his torment. 
Upon this the impostor told him, that 
nothing but the most extraordinary mor- 
tifications, such as the disci/iline of the 
ivhip, performed during eight days by 
the whole monasteiy, and Jetzer's lying 
prostrate in the form of one crucified 
m the chapel during mass, could con- 
tribute to his deliverance. He added, 
that the performance of these mortifica- 
tions would draw down upon Jetzer the 
peculiar protection of the Blessed Vir- 
gin ; and concluded by saying, that he 
would appear to him again, accompa- 
nied Avith two other spirits. Morning 
was no sooner come, than Jetzer gave 
an account of this apparition to the rest 
of the convent, who all unanimously 
advised him to undergo the discipline 
that was enjoined him, and every one 
consented to bear his share of the task 
imposed. The deluded simpleton obey- 
ed, and was admired as a saint by the 
multitudes that crowded about the con- 
vent ; while the four friars that managed 
the imposture magnified, in the most 
pompous manner, the miracle of this 
apparition in their seiTnons, and in their 
discourses. The night after, the appa- 
rition was renewed witli the addition of 
two impostors, dressed like devils, and 
Jetzer's faith was augmented by heai'- 
ing from the spectre all the secrets of 
his life and thoughts, which the impos- 
tors had learned from his confessor. 
In tiiis and some subsequent scenes (the 
detail of whose enormities, for the sake 



DOM

of brevity, we shall here omit) the im- 
postor talked much to Jetzer of the 
Dominican order, which he said was 
peculiarly dear to the Blessed Virgin : 
he added', that the Virgin knew herself 
to be conceived hi original sin ; that the 
doctors who taught the contrary were 
in purgatory ; that the Blessed Virgin 
abhorred tlie Franciscans for making 
her equal with her Son ; and that the 
town of Bern would be destroyed for 
harbouring such plagues within her 
walls. In one of these apparitions Jetzer 
imagined that the voice of the spectre 
resembled that of the prior of the con- 
vent, and he was not mistaken ; but, not 
suspecting a fraud, he gave little atten- 
tion to this. The prior appeared in 
various forms, sometimes in that of St. 
Barbara, at others in that of St. Ber- 
nard : at length he assumed that of the 
Virgin Mary, and, for that pui-pose, 
clothed himself in the habits that were 
employed to adorn the statue of the 
Virgin in the great festivals. The little 
images, that on these days are set on 
the altars, were made use of for angels, 
which, being tied to a cord that passed 
through a pulley over Jetzer's head, 
rose up and down, and danced about 
the pretended Virgin to increase the 
delusion. The Virgin, thus equipped, 
addressed a long discourse to Jetzer, in 
which, among other things, she told him 
that she was conceived m original sin, 
though she had remained but a short 
time under that blemish. She gave him, 
as a miraculous proof of her presence, 
a host, or consecrated wafer, which 
turned from white to red in a moment ; 
and after various visits, in which the 
greatest enormities were transacted, 
the Virgin-prior told Jetzer that she 
would give him the most affecting and 
undoubted marks of her Son's love, by 
imprinting on him Xhtjive noounds that 
pierced Jesus on the cross, as she had 
done before to St. Lucia and St. Catha- 
rine. Accordingly she took his hand by 
force, and struck a large nail througn 
it, which threw the poor dupe into the 
greatest torment. The next night this 
masculine virgin brought, as he pre- 
tended, some of the linen in which 
Christ had been buried, to soften the 
wound; and gave Jetzer a soporific 
draught, which had in it the blood of an 
unbaptized child, some grains of in- 
cense and of consecrated salt, some 
quicksilver, the hairs of the eye-brows 
of a child ; all which, with some stupi- 
fying and poisonous ingredients, were 
mingled together by the prior with 
magic ceremonies, and a solemn dedica- 
tion of himself to the devil in hope of 



his succour. The draught threw the 
poor wretch into a soil of lethargy, du- 
ring which the monks imprinted on his 
body the other four wounds of Christ 
in such a manner that he felt no pain. 
When he awakened, he found, to his 
unspeakable joy, those impressions on 
his body, and came at last to fancy him- 
self a representative of Christ in the 
various parts of his passion. He was, 
in this state, exposed to the admiring 
multitude on the principal altar of the 
convent, to the great mortification of 
the Franciscans. The Dominicans gave 
him some other draughts, that threw 
him into con\Tilsions ; which were fol- 
lowed by a pipe into the mouths of two 
images, one of Mary, and another of 
the child Jesus, the former of which had 
tears painted upon its cheeks in a lively 
manner. The little Jesus asked his mo- 
ther, by means of this voice (which was 
that of the prior's,) why she wept ? and 
she answered, that her tears were ow- 
ing to the impious manner in which the 
Franciscans attributed to her the ho- 
nour that was due to him, in saying 
.that she was conceived and bom with- 
out sin. 

The apparitions, false prodigies and 
abominable stratagems of these Domi- 
nicans were repeated every night ; and 
the matter was at length so grossly 
over-acted, that, simple as Jetzer was, 
he at last discovered it, and had almost 
killed the prior, who appeared to him 
one night in the form of the Virgin with 
a crown on her head. The Dominicans 
fearing, by this discovery, to lose the 
fruits of their imposture, thought the 
best method would be to own the whole 
matter to Jetzer, and to engage him, 
by the most seducing promises of opu- 
lence and glory, to carry on the cheat. 
Jetzer was persuaded, or at least ap- 
peared to be so. But the Dominicans 
suspecting that he was not entirely 
gained over, resolved to poison him ; 
but his constitution was so vigorous, 
that, though they gave him poison five 
several times, he was not destroved by 
it. One day they sent him a loaf pre- 
pared with some spices, which, growing 
green in a day or two, he threw a piece 
of it to a wolf's whelps that were in the 
monastery, and it killed them immedi- 
ately. At another time they poisoned 
the host, or consecrated wafer ; but, as 
he vomited it up soon after he had s^val- 
lowed it, he escaped once more. In 
short, there were no means of securing 
him, which the most detestable impiet)- 
and barbarity could invent, that they 
did not put in practice: till finding, at 
last, an oppoitumty of getting out of the

convent, he threw himself into the hands 
of the magistrates, to whom he made a 
full discovery of this infernal plot. The 
affair being brought to Rome, commis- 
saries were sent from thence to exa- 
mine the matter ; and the whole cheat 
being fully proved, the four friars \yere 
solemnly 'degraded from their priest- 
hood, and were burnt alive on the last 
day of Mav, 1509. Jetzer died some 
time after at Constance, having poisoned 
himself, as was believed by some. Had 
his life been taken, away before he had 
found an opportunity of making the dis- 
covery already mentioned, this execra- 
ble and horrid plot, which in many of 
its circumstances was conducted with 
art, would have been handed down to 
posterity as a stupendous miracle. 

The Dominicans were perpetually 
employed in stigmatizing with the name 
of heresy numbers of learned and pious 
men ; in enci'oaching upon the rights 
and properties of others, to augment 
their possessions; and in laying the 
most iniquitous snares and stratagems 
for the destruction of their adversaries. 
Tliey were the principal counsellors bj' 
Avhose instigation and advice Leo X. 
was determined to the public condem- 
nation of Luther. The papal see never 
had more active and useful abettors 
than this order, and that of the Jesuits. 
DOMINION OF GOD, is his abso- 
lute right to, and authority over, all his 
creatures, to do with them as he pleases. 
It is distinguished from his power thus : 
his dominion is a right of making what 
he pleases, and possessing what he 
makes, and of disposing what he doth 
possess; whereas his fioiver is an ability 
to make what he hath a right to create, 
to hold what he doth possess, and to 
execute what he hath purposed or re- 
solved. 

DONATISTS, ancient schismatics, 
in Africa, so denominated from their 
leader, Donatus. They had their ori- 
gin in the year 311, when, in the room 
of Mensurius, who died in that year, on 
l\is return toRome,C3ecilian was elected 
bishbp of Carthage, and consecrated, 
without the concurrence of the Numi- 
dian bishops, by those of Africa alone, 
whom the people refused to acknow- 
ledge, and to whom they opposed Ma- 
jorinus, who accordingly was ordained 
bv Donatus bishop g{ Casac Nigi-ae. 
They were condemned, in a council 
held at Rome, two yeai-s after their se- 
paration ; and afterwards in another at 
Aries, tlie year following ; and again at 
Milan, before Constantine the Great, 
in o]6, who deprived them of their 
churches, and sent their seditious bi- 



shops into banishment, and punished 
some of them with deatli. Their cause 
was espoused by another Donatus call- 
ed the Great, the principal bishop of 
that sect, who, with numbers of his fol- 
lowers, was exiled by oixler of Con- 
stats. Many of them were punished 
with great severity. — See Circumcel- 
LIONES. However, after the accession 
of Julian to the throne in 362, they were 
permitted to return, and restored to 
their former liberty. Gratian published 
several edicts agamst them, and in 377 
deprived them of their churches, and 
prohibited all their assernblies. But, 
notwithstanding the severities they suf- 
fered, it appears that they had a very 
considerable number of churches to- 
wards the close of this centuiy ; but at 
this time they began to decline, on ac- 
coimt of a schism among themselves 
occasioned by the election of two bi- 
sho])s, in the room of Parmenian, the 
successor of Donatus: one party elected 
Primian, and were called Primianists ; 
and another Maximian, and were called 
Alaximianists. Their decline was al^o 
precipitated by the zealous opposition 
of St. Augustnie, and by the violent 
measures which were pursued against 
them by order of the emperor Honorius, 
at the solicitation of two councils held 
at Carthage, the one in 404, and the 
other in 411. Many of them were fined, 
their bishops were banished, and some 
put to death. This sect revived and 
multiplied under the protection of the 
Vandals, who invaded Africa in 427, and 
took possession of this province : but it 
sunk again under new severities, when 
their empire was overturned, in 534. 
Nevertheless, they remained in a sepa- 
rate body till the close of this century, 
when Gregory, tlie Roman pontiff, used 
various methods for svippressing them : 
his zeal succeeded, and thei-e are few 
traces to be found of the Donatists after 
this period. They were distinguished by 
other appellations, as Circumcelliones, 
Montenses or Mountaineers, Camp.etes, 
Rufiites, &amp;:c. They held three coun- 
cils, that of Cita in Numidia, and two at 
Carthage. 

The Donatists, it is said, held that 
baptism confei-red out of the church, 
that is, out of their sect, wa^s null ; and 
accordingly they rebaptized those who 
joined their party from other churches ; 
they also re-ordained their ministers. 
Donatus seems likewise to have embra- 
ced the doctrine of the Arians ; though 
St. Augustine affirms that the Donatists 
in this point kept clear of the errors of 
their leader. 
DORT, Synod of; a national synod,

DRE 



summoned by authority of the states- 
general, the provinces of Holland, 
Utrecht, and Overyssel excepted, and 
liekl at Dort, 1618. The most eminent 
divines of the United Pro^'inces, and 
deputies from the churches of England, 
Scotland, Switzerland, Bi'emen, Hessia, 
and the Palatinate, assembled on this 
occasion, in order to decide the contro- 
versy between the Cahinists and Ar- 
minians. The synod had hardl)"^ com- 
menced its deliberations before a dis- 
pute on tlie mode of proceeding, drove 
the Arminian party from the assembly. 
The Arminians insisted upon beginning 
\vith a refutation of the Calvinistic doc- 
trines, especially that of reprobation ; 
whilst the synod determined, that, as 
the remonstrants were accused of de- 
parting from the reformed faith, they 
ought first to justify themselves by 
scriptural proof of their own opinions. 
All means to persuade the Arminians 
to submit to this procedure having fail- 
ed, they were banished the synod, for 
their refusal. The synod, howe\er, 
proceeded in their examination of the 
Arminian tenets, condemned their opi- 
nions, and excommunicated their per- 
sons : whether justly or unjustly, let 
the reader determine. Surely no one 
can be an advocate for the persecution 
which followed, and which drove these 
men from their churches and country 
into exile and poverty. The authority 
of this synod was far from being uni- 
versally acknowledged, either in Hol- 
land or in England. The provinces of 
Friesland, Zealand, Utrecht, Guelder- 
land, and Groningen, could not be per- 
suaded to adopt their decisions ; and 
they were opposed by king James I. 
and archbishop Laud, in England. 

DOSITHEANS, an ancient sect 
among the Samaritans, in the first cen- 
tury of the Christian sera; so called 
from Dositheus, who endeavoured to 
persuade the Samaritans that he was 
the Messiah foretold by Moses. He 
had many followers, and his sect was 
still subsisting at Alexandria in the time 
of the patriarch Eulogius, as appears 
from a decree of that patriarch pub- 
lished by Photius. In that decree, Eu- 
logius accuses Dositheus of injuriously 
treating the ancient patriarchs and pro- 
phets, and attributing to himself the 
spirit of prophecy. He makes him con- 
temporary with Simon Magus ; and ac- 
cuses him of comipting the Pentateuch, 
and of composing several books directly 
contrary to the law of God. 

DOUBTS and Fears, are terms fre- 
quently used to denote the uncertainty 
Qf mind we are in respecting our inte- 



rest in the divine fa\our. The causes of 
our doubts may be such as these : per- 
sonal declension : not knowing the ex- 
act time, place, or means of our conver- 
sion ; improper ^'iews of the charac- 
ter and decrees of God ; the fluctuation 
of religious experience as to the enjoy- 
ment of God in prayer, hearing, &amp;c.; 
the depth of our affliction ; relapses into 
sin ; the fall of professors ; ana the hi- 
dings of God's face. Wiiile some are 
continually harassed with doubts and 
fears, there are others who tell us they 
know not what it is to doubt : yea, who 
think it a sin to doubt: so prone are men 
to run to extremes, as if there were no 
medium between constant full assurance 
and perpetual doubt. The true Chris- 
tian, perhaps, steers between the two. 
He is not always doubting, nor is he 
always living in the full exercise of faith. 
It is not unlawful at certain seasons to 
'. doubt. " It is a sin," says one, " for a 
I believer to live so as not to have his 
I e\-idences clear. ; but it is no sin for him 
I to be so honest and impartial as to 
doubt, when in fact his evidences are 
not clear." Let the humble Christian, 
I however, beware of an extreme. Prayer, 
conversation with experienced Chris- 
tians, reading the promises, and consi- 
I deration of the divine goodness, will 
j have a tendency to remove unnecessary' 
doubts. 

I DOXOLOGY, a hymn used in praise 
of the Almighty, distinguished by the 
! titles of the Greater and the Less. Both 
i the doxologies are used in the church 
of England ; the former being repeated 
after eveiy psalm, and the latter used 
in the communion service. Doxology 
the Greater, or the angelic hymn, was 
of great note in the ancient church. It 
began with the words the angels sung 
at the birth of Christ, " Glory to God," 
&amp;c. Doxology the Less, was anciently 
only a single sentence without a re- 
sponse, ininning in these words : " Glory 
be to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Ghost, world without end, 
amen." Part of the latter clause, " as 
it was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be," &amp;c. was inserted some time 
after the first composition. 

DRAGOONmG, one of the me- 
thods used by papists after the revoca- 
tion of the edict of Nantz, under Lewis

Avill suffer him to peruse the account of

sion of some tremendous event. It 
keeps the mind in a perpetual alarm, 
in an eager watchfulness of eveiy cir- 
cumstance that bears any relation to the 
evil apprehended. 

DRUIDS, the priests or ministers of 
religion among the ancient Gauls, Bri- 
tons, and Germans. They were chosen 
out of the best families ; and the honours 
of their birth, joined with those of their 
function, procured them the highest 
veneration among the people. They 
were versed in astrology, geometry, 
natural philosophy, politics, and geo- 
graphy ; they wei'e the interjjreters of 
religion, and the judges of all affairs 
indifferently. Whoever refused obedi- 
ence to them was declared impious and 
accursed. We know but little as to 
their peculiar doctrines, only that they 
belie\'ed the immortality of the soul, 
and, as is generally also supposed, the 
transmigration of it to other bodies ; 
though a late author makes it appear 
highly probable they did not believe 
this last, at least not in the sense of the 
Pythagoreans. The chief settlement of 
the Druids in Britain was in the isle of 
Anglesey, the ancient Mona, which 
they might choose for this purpose, as 
it is well stored with precious groves of 
their favourite oak. They were divided 
into several classes or branches, such as 
the priests, the poets, the augurs, the 
civil judges, and instructors of youth. 
Strabo, howe\'er, does not conriprehend 
all these different orders under the deno- 
mination of druids; he only distinguishes 
three kinds; bardi, poets; the vates, 
priests and naturalists ; and the druids, 
who, besides the study of nature, appli- 
ed themselves likewise to morality. 

Their garments were remarkably 
long; and when employed m religious 
ceremonies, they likewise wore a white 
surplice. They generally carried a 
■wand in their hands, and wore a kind of 
ornament, enchased with gold, about 
their necks, called the druid's eg^. 
They had one chief, or arch-druid, in 
every nation, who acted as high priest, 
or /ion t if ex riiaximus. He had absolute 
authority over the rest, and command- 
ed, decreed, and punislied at pleasure. 
They worshipped the Supreme Being 
under the name of Esiis or Hesus, and 
the symbol of the oak; and had no 
other temple than a wood or a grove, 
where all their religious rites were per- 
formed. Nor was any person permitted 
to enter that sacred recess unless he 
carried with him a chain in token of his 
absolute dependence on the Deity. In- 
deed, their whole religion originally 
consisted in acknowledging that the Su- 



preme Being, who made his abode in 
these sacred groves, governed the uni- 
verse ; and, that every creatui'e ought 
to obey his laws, and pay him divme 
homage. They considered the oak as 
the emblem, or rather the peculiar re- 
sidence of the Almighty ; and accord- 
ingly chaplets of it were worn, both by 
the druids and people, in their religious 
ceremonies : the altars were strewed 
with its leaves, and encircled with its 
branches. The fruit of it, especially 
the misletoe, was thought to contain a 
divme virtue, and to be the peculiar 
gift of Heaven. It was, therefore, 
sought for on the sixth day of the moon 
with the greatest earnestness and anxie- 
ty; and when found, was hailed with 
sure rapture of joy, as almost exceeds 
imagination to conceive. As soon as the 
druids were informed of the fortunate 
discovery, they prepared eveiy thing 
ready for the sacrifice under the oak, 
to which they fastened two white bulls 
by the homs ; then the arch-dniid, at- 
tended by a prodigious number of peo- 
ple, ascended the tree, dressed in white ; 
and, with a consecrated golden knife, or 
pnining hook, cropped the misletoe, 
which he received in his robe, amidst 
the rapturous exclamations of the peo- 
ple. Having secured this sacred plant, 
he descended the tree ; the bulls were 
sacrificed ; and the Deity invoked to 
bless his own gift, and render it effica- 
cious in those distempers in which it 
should be administered. 

DRUNKENNESS, intoxication with 
strong liquor. It is either actual or ha- 
bitual ; just as it is one thing to be dnink, 
and another to be a drunkard. The evil 
of drunkenness appears in the following 
bad effects : 1. It betrays most constitu- 
tions either to extravagance of anger, 
or sins of lewdness. — 2. It disqualifies 
men for the duties of their station, both 
by tlie temporary disorder of their fa- 
culties, and at length by a constant in- 
capacity and stupefaction. — 3. It is at- 
tended with expense, which can often 
be ill spared. — 4. It is sure to occasion 
uneasiness to the family of the drunk- 
ard. — 5. It shortens life. — 6. It is a most 
pernicious awfiil example to others. — 7. 
It is hardly ever cured. — 8. It is a vio- 
lation of God's word, Prov. xx. 1. Eph. 
V. 18. Is. V. 11. Rom. xiii. 13. " The 
appetite for intoxicating liquor appears 
to me," says Paley, " to be almost al- 
ways acquired. One proof of which is, 
that it is apt to return only at particular 
times and places ; as after dinner, in 
the evening, on the market-day, in such 
a company, at such a tavern." How 
careful, then, tjhould we be, lest we

form habits of this kind, or choose com- 
pany who are addicted to it ; how cau- 
tious and circumspect should we act, 
that we be not found guilty of a sin 
which degrades human nature, ban- 
ishes reason, insults God, and exposes 
us to the greatest evils ! Pa/ey's Mor.

DULCINISTS, the foUowers of Dul- 
cinus, a layman of Novara in Lombardy, 
about the beginning of the fourteenth 
century. He taught that the law of the 
Father, which had continued till Moses, 
was a law of grace and wisdom ; but 
that the law ot the Holy Ghost, which 
began with himself in 1307, was a law 
entirely of love, which would last to the 
end of the world. 

DUNKERS, a denomination which 
took its rise in the year 1724. It was 
founded by a German, who, weary of 
the woi-ld, retired to an agi'eeable soli- 
tude within fifty miles of Philadelphia, 
for the more free exercise of religious 
contemplation. Curiosity attracted fol- 
lowers, and his simple and engaeitig 
manners made them proselytes. Tliey 
soon settled a little colony, called Eu- 
phrate, in allusion to the Hebrews, who 
used to sing psalms on the borders of 
the river Euphrates. This denomuia- 
tion seem to have obtained their name 
from their baptizing their new converts 
by plunging. They are also called 
Tumblers, trom the manner in which 
thej^ performed baptism, which is by 
putting the person, while kneeling, 
iiead first under water, so as to resem- 
ble the motion of the body in the action 
of tumbling. They use the triune im- 
mersion, with laying on the hands and 
prayer, even when the person baptized 
is in the water. 

Their habit seems to be peculiar to 
themselves, consisting of a long tunic, 
or coat, reaching down to their heels, 
with a sash or girdle round the waist, 
and a cap, or hood, hanging from the 
shoulders, like the dress of the Domi- 
nican friars. The men do not shave 
the head or beard. The men and wo- 
men have separate habitations and dis- 
tbict goveniments. For these purposes 
they ha^^e erected two large wooden 
buildings, one of which is occupied by 
the brethren, the other by the sisters 
of the society ; and in each of them 
thei'e is a banqueting room, and an 
apartment for public worship ; for the 
brethren and sisters do not meet toge- 
ther, even at their devotions. They live 
chiefly upon roots and other vegetables, 



the rules of their society not allowing 
them flesh, except on particular occa- 
sions, when they hold what they call 
a love-feast: at which time the bre- 
thren and sisters dine together in a 
large apartment, and eat mutton ; but 
no other meat. In each of their little 
cells they have a bench fixed, to serve 
the purpose of a bed, and a small block 
of wood for a pillow. The Dunkers 
allow of no intercourse between the 
brethren and sisters, not even by mar- 
riage. The principal tenets of the 
Dunkers appear to be these : that fu- 
ture happiness is only to be attained by 
penance and outward mortification in 
this life ; and that, as Jesus Christ by his 
meritorious sufle rings, became the Re- 
deemer of mankind in general, so each 
individual of the human race, by a life 
of abstinence and restraint, may work 
out his own salvation. Nay, they go so 
far as to admit of works of supereroga- 
tion, and declare that a man may do 
much more than he is in justice or 
equity obliged to do, and that his super- 
abundant works may therefore be ap- 
plied to the salvation of others. This 
denomination deny the eternity of fu- 
ture punishments, and believe that the 
dead have the Gospel preached to them 
by our Sa^'iour, and that the souls of the 
just are employed to preach the Gospel 
to those who have had no revelation in 
this life. They suppose the Jewish sab- 
bath, sabbatical year, and year of jubi- 
lee, are typical of certain periods, after 
the general judgment, in which the 
souls of those who are not tlien admit- 
ted into happiness arc purified from 
their corruption. If any within those 
smaller periods ai'e so far humbled as 
to acknowledge the perfections of God, 
and to own Christ as their only Saviour, 
they are received to felicity ; while 
those who continue olistinate are re- 
served in torments until the grand pe- 
riod typified by the jubilee arrives, in 
which all shall be made happy in the 
endless fruition of the Deity. They also 
deny the imputation of Adam's sin to 
his "posterity. They disclaim violence 
even in cases of selt-defence, and suffer 
themselves to be defrauded or Avronged 
rather than go to law. 
Their church government and disci- 

gline are the same with the English 
aptists, except that every brother is 
allowed to speak in the congregation; 
and their best speaker is usually or- 
damed to be the minister. They have 
deacons and deaconesses from among 
their ancient widows and exhorters, 
who are all licensed to use their gifts

EASTER, the day on which the 
Christian church commemorates our 
Saviour's resurrection. It is called by 
the Greeks Pasgu ; and by the Latins 
Fascha, a Hebrew woi-d signifying pas- 
sage, applied to the Jewish feast at the 
passoxer. It is called Easter in English, 
li'om the Saxon goddess Eostre, whose 
festival was held in April. The Asiatic 
churches kept their Easter upon the 
very same day that the Jews obsei'ved 
their passover, and others on the first 
Sunday after the first full moon in the 
new year. This controversy was de- 
termined in the council of Nice, when 
it was ordained that Easter should be 
kept upon one and the same day, which 
should always be Sunday, in all Chris- 
tian churches in the world. 

EBIOMITES, ancient heretics, who 
rose in the church in the very first age 
thereof, and formed themselves into a 
sect in the second century, denying the 
divinity of Jesus Christ. Origen takes 
them to hax'C been so called from the 
Hebrew word ebion, which in that lan- 
guage signifies floor; because, says he, 
ihey were poor m sense, and wanting 
understanding. Eusebius, with a view 
to the same etymology, is of opinion 
they were thus called, as having poor 
thoughts of Jesus Christ, taking him for 
no more than a mere man. It is more 
probable the Jews gave this appellation 
to the Christians in general out of con- 
tempt ; because, in the first times, there 
were few but poor people that embra- 
ced the Christian religion. The Ebion- 
ites were little else than a branch of the 
Nazarenes ; only that they altered and 
corrupted, in many things, the purity 
of the faith held among the first adhe- 
rents to Christianity. For this reason, 
Origen distinguishes two kinds of Ebion- 
kes in his answer to Celsus; the one 
believed that Jesus Christ was born of 
a virgin; and the other, that he was 
born after the manner of other men. 
The first were orthodox in every thing, 
except that to the Christian doctrine 
they joined the ceremonies of the Jewish 
law, with the Jews, Samai'itans, and 
Nazarenes ; together with the tradi- 
tions of the Pharisees. They differed 



from the Nazarenes, hov/cver, in sevc- 
I'al things, chiefly as to what regards the 
authority of the sacred writings ; for the 
Nazareiies received all for Scripture 
contained in the Jewish canon ; whereas 
the Ebionites rejected all the prophets, 
and held the very names of David, Solo- 
mon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, in 
abhorrence. They also rejected all St. 
Paul's epistles, whom thev treated with 
the utmost disrespect. They received 
nothing of the Old Testament but the 
Pentateuch. They agreed with the 
Nazarenes, in using the Hebrew Gos- 
pel of St. Matthew, otherwise called 
the Gospel of the twelve apostles ; but 
they corrupted tlieir copy in abundance 
of places ; and particularly had left out 
the genealogy of our Sa\'iour, which 
was preserved entire in that of the Na- 
zarenes, and even in those used by the 
Cerinthians. Besides the Hebrew Gos- 
pel of St. Matthew, the Ebionites had 
adopted several other books under the 
titles of St. James, John, and the other 
apostles ; they also made use of the tra- 
vels of St. Peter, whicli are supposed to 
have been written by St. Clement ; but 
liad altered them so, that there was 
scarce any thing of tnith left in them. 
They even made that saint tell a num- 
ber of falsehoods, the better to autho- 
rize their own practices. 

ECCLESIASTICAL, an appellation 
given to whatever belongs to the church; 
thus we say ecclesiastical polity, juris- 
diction, history, &amp;c. 

ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY, a 
narration of the transactions, revolu- 
tions, and events, that relate to the 
church. As to the utility of church 
history. Dr. Jortin, who was an acute 
writer on this subject, shall here speak 
for us: he observes, 1. That it will 
show us the amazing progress of Chris- 
tianity through the Roman empire, 
through the East and West, although 
the powers of the world cruelly op- 

Posed it. 2. Connected with Jewish and 
agan history, it will show us the total 
destruction of Jei-usalem, the overthrow 
of the Jewish church and state; and the 
continuance of that unhappy nation for 
1700 years, though dispersed over the

face of the earth, and oppressed at dif- 
ferent times by Pagans, Christians, and 
Mahometans. — 3. It sliows us that the 
increase of Christianity produced in the 
countries wliere it Avas received, the 
overthrow and extinction of paganism, 
Avhich, after a feeble resistance, perish- 
ed about the sixth century.— -4. It shows 
us how Christianity hath been continu- 
ed and deUvered down from the apos- 
tolical to the present age. — 5. It shows 
us the xarious opinions which prevailed 
at different times amongst the fathers 
and other Chi-istians, and how they de- 
parted more or less from the simplicity 
of the Gospel. — 6. It will enable us to 
form a tnae judgment of the merit of 
the fathers, and of the use which is to 
be made of them. — 7. It will show us 
the evil of imposing unreasonable terms 
of communion, and requiring Christians 
to profess doctrines not propounded in 
Scriptural words, but interred as con- 
sequences from passages of Scripture, 
which one may call systems of conse- 
Tjucntial divinity. — 8. It will show us 
the origin and ]5rogress of popery ; and, 
lastly, it will show us, — 9. The origin 
and progress of tlie reformation. See

ECLECTICS, a name given to some 
ancient philosophers, who, without at- 
taching themselves to any particular 
sect, took what they judged good and 
solid, from each. One Potamon, of 
Alexandria, who lived under Augustus 
and Tiberius, and who, weary of doubt- 
ing of all things, with the Sceptics and 
Pyrrhonians, was the person who form- 
ed tl\is sect. 

ECLECTICS, or modem Platonics, 



a sect which arose in tlie Christiaii 
church towards the close of the second 
centur)^ They professed to make truth 
the only object of their enquiry, and to 
be ready to adopt from all the different 
systems and sects such tenets as they 
thought agreeable to it. They prefer- 
red Plato to the other philosophers, and 
looked upon his opinions concerning 
God, the human soul, and things invi- 
sible, as conformable to the spirit and 
genius of the Christian doctrine. One 
of the principal patrons of this system 
was Ammonius haccas, wlio at this time 
laid the foundation of that sect, after- 
wards distinguished by the name of the 
J^ew Platonics in the Alexandrian 
school. 

ECSTACY, or Extacy, a transport 
of the mind, which susjiends the func- 
tions of the senses by the intense con- 
templation of some extraordinary object. 

ECTHESIS, a confession of faith, the 
form of an edict published in the year 
639, by the emperor Heraclius, with a 
view to ])acify the troubles occasioned 
by the Eutvchian heresy in the eastern 
church. However, the same prince re- 
Aoked it, on being informed that pope 
Severinus had condemned it, as favour- 
ing the Monothelites ; declaring, at the 
same time, that Sergius, patriarch of 
Constantinople, was the author of it. See 

EUTYCHIANS. 

EDIFICATION ; this word signifies 
a building up. Hence we call a build- 
ing an edifice. Applied to spiritual 
thnigs, it signifies the improving, adorn- 
ing, and comforting the mind; and a 
Christian may be said to be edified when 
he is encouraged and animated in the 
ways and works of the Lord. The 
means to promote our own edification 
are, prayer, self-examination, reading 
the Scriptures, hearing the Gospel, me- 
ditation, attendance 'on all appointed or- 
dinances. To edify others there should 
be love, spiritual conversation, forbear- 
ance, faithfiilness, benevolent exertions, 
and unifoi-mitv of conduct. 

EFFRONTES, a sect of heretics, in 
1534, who scraped their forehead witli 
a knife till it bled, and then poured oil 
into the wound. This ceremony served 
them instead of baptism. They are 
likewise said to have denied the divinity 
of the H &lt;lv Spirit. 

EICETiE, a denomination in the year 
680, who affirmed that, in order to make 
prayer acceptable to God it should be 
performed dancing. 

EJACULATION, a short prayer, in 
which the mind is directed to God on 
anv emevgencv. See Praykr. 

ELCESAlTES, ancient heretics, who

made their appearance in the reign of 
the emperor Trajan, and took their 
name from their leader, Elcesai. They 
kept a mean between the Jews, Chris- 
tians, and Pagans : they worshipped but 
one God, obser\ ed the Jewish sabbath, 
circumcision, and the other ceremonies 
of the law ; yet they rejected the Pen- 
tateuch and the prophets : nor had they 
any more respect for the writings of the 
apostles. 

ELDER (TTjso-fuTffoj,) an overseer, 
ruler, leader. 

Elders, or senioi's, in ancient Jewish 
polity, were persons the most consi- 
derable for age,' experience, and wis- 
dom. Of this sort were the 70 men 
■whom Moses associated with himself in 
the government: such likewise after- 
wards were those who held the first 
I'ank in the synagogue as presidents. — 
Elders, in church histoiy, were origi- 
nally those who held the first place in 
the assemblies of the primitive Chris- 
tians. The word presb&gt;"ter is often used 
in the New Testament in this significa- 
tion ; hence the first councils of Chris- 
tians were called Presbyterm, or coun- 
cils of elders. — Elders In the pi-esbyte- 
rian discipline, are officers, who, in con- 
junction with the ministers and deacons, 
compose the kiik sessions, Avho for- 
merly used to inspect and regulate mat- 
ters of religion and discipline ; but 
whose principal business now is to take 
care of the poor's funds. They are 
chosen from among the people, and are 
received publicly with some degi-ee of 
ceremony. In Scotland there is an in- 
definite number of elders in each parish, 
generally about twelve. See Presby- 
terians. 

It has long been a matter of dispute, 
whether there are any such officers as 
lay-elders mentioned in Scripture. On 
the one side it is observed, that these 
officers are no where mentioned as 
being alone or .single, but always as be- 
ing many in every congregation. They 
are a'lso mentioned separately from the 
brethren. Their office, more than once, 
is described as being distinct from that 
of preaching, not only in Rom. xii. where 
he that ruleth is expressly distinguished 
from him that exhorteth or teacheth, 
but also in that passage, 1 Tim. v. 17. 
On the other side it is said, that from 
the above-mentioned passages, nothing 
can be collected with certainty to es- 
tablish this opinion; neither can it be 
inferred from any other passage that 
churches should be fui-nished with such 
officers, though perhaps prudence, in 
some circumstances, may make them 
expedient. "I incline to thinli," says 



Dr. Guise, on the passage 1 Tim. v. ir, 
"that the apostle intends only preach- 
ing elders, when he directs double ho- 
nour to be paid to the elders that rule 
well, especially those who labour in 
the word and doctrine ; and that the 
distinction lies not in tlic order of offi- 
cers, but in the degree of their diligence, 
faithfulness, and eminence in laboriously 
fulfilling their ministerial work ; and so 
the emphasis is to be laid on the word 
labour m the word and doctrine, which 
has an especially annexed to it." 

ELECTION. This word has differ- 
ent meanings. 1. It signifies God's 
taking a whole nation, comnmnity, or 
body of men, into extcilaal covenant 
with himself, by giving them the advan- 
tage of revelation as the rule of their 
belief and practice, when other nations 
are without it, Deut. vii. 6. — 2. A tem- 
porary designation of some person or 
persons to the filling up some particular 
station in the visible church, or office in 
ciA'il life, John vi. 70. 1 Sam. x. 24. — .". 
That gi-acious and almighty act of the 
Divine Spirit, whereby Ciod actually 
and visibly separates his people frorfi 
the world by effectual calling, John xv. 
19. — 4. That eternal, sovereign, uncon- 
ditional, particular, and immutable act 
of God, whereby he selected some from 
among all mankind, and of every nation 
under heaven, to be redeemed and 
everlastingly saved by Christ, Eph. i. 4. 
2 Thess. ii. i3. See Decree, and Pre- 
destination. 

ELOQUENCE, Pulpit. "The chief 
characteristics of the eloquence suited 
to the pulpit are tliese tv,o — gravity 
and warmth. The serious nature of the 
subjects belonging to the pulpit requires 
gravity; their importance to mankind 
requires warmth. It is far from being 
either easy or common to unite these 
characters of eloquence. The grave, 
I when it is predominant, is apt to run 
into a dull, uniform solemnity. The 
ivarm, when it wants gravity, borders 
on the theatrical and light. The union 
of the two must be studied by all preach- 
! ers, as of the utmost consequence, both 
in the composition of their discourses, 
and in their manner of delivery. Gra- 
vity and warmth united, form that cha- 
ractei- of pi-eaching, which the French 
call onction : the affecting, penetrating, 
interesting manner, flowing from a strong 
sensibility of heart in the preacher, the 
importance of those truths which he de- 
livers, and an earnest desire that they 
may make full impression on the hearts 
of his hearers." See Declamation, 
Sermons. 

EMULATION, a generous ardour 



ENE 



163 



ENT 



kindled by the praiseworthy examples 
of others, which impels us to imitate, 
to rival, and, if possible, to excel them. 
This passion involves in it esteem of the 
person whose attainments or conduct 
we emulate, of the qualities and actions 
in which we emulate him, and a desire 
cf resemblance, together with a joy 
springing from the hope of success. 
The word comes originally from the 
Greek atxiWa, contest, whence the La- 
tin eemulus, and thence our emulation. 
Plato makes emulation the daughter of 
en^'y : if so, there is a great diinerence 
between the mother and the offspring ; 
the one being a virtue and the otlier a 
vice. Emulation admires great actions, 
and strives to imitate them ; envy re- 
fuses them the praises that are their 
due ; enmlation is generous, and only 
thinks of equalling or suipassing a ri- 
val ; envy is low, and only seeks to 
lessen him. It would, tlierefore, be more 
proper to suppose emulation the daugh- 
ter of admiration; admiration being a 
principal uigredient in the composition 
of it. 

ENCRATITES, a sect in the second 
century, who alistained from marriage, 
wine, and animals. 

ENDOWMENT, ECCLESIASTI- 
Ca\L ; a term used to denote the set- 
tlement of a pension upon a minister, 
or the building of a church, or the se- 
vering a sufficient portion of tithes for 
a vicar, when the benefice is appro- 
priated. 

Among the Dissenters, they are be- 
nefactions left to their place or congre- 
gation, for the support of their minis- 
ters. Where the congregation is poor 
or small, these have been found benefi- 
cial ; but in many cases they have been 
detrimental. Too often has it tended to 
relax the exertions of the people ; and 
when such a fund has fallen into the 
hands of an unsuitable minister, it has 
prevented his removal ; when, had he 
derived no support from t]\e people, 
necessity would have caused him to de- 
part, and make room for one more 
worthy. 

ENERGICI, a denomination in the 
sixteenth century ; so called because 
they held that tlie eucharist was the 
energy and virtue of Jesus Christ ; not 
his l)odj% nor a representation thereof. 

ENERGUMENS, persons supposed 
to be possessed with the devil, concern- 
ing whom there were many i-egulations 
among the primitive Christians. They 
were denied baptism and the eucharist ; 
at least this was the practice of some 
churches ; and though they were under 
the care of exorcists, yet it was thought 



a becoming act of charity to let them 
ha\ e the public prayers of the church, 
at which they were permitted to be 
present. 

ENTHUSIASM. To obtain just de- 
finitions of words which are promis- 
cuously used, it must be confessed, is no 
small difficulty. This word, it seems, 
is used both in a good and a bad sense. 
In its best sense it signifies a divine affla- 
tus or inspiration. It is also taken for 
that noble ardour of mind which leads 
j us to imagine any thing sublime, grand, 
or sui-prising. In its worst sense it sig- 
nifies any impression on the fancy, or 
agitation of the passions, of which a 
man can give no rational account. It 
is generally applied to religious cha- 
racters, and is said to be derived (arro 
T!ov iv 6uo-iaif fiaivj/ifvuv) from the wild ges- 
tures and speeches of ancient religion- 
ists, pretending to more than ordinary 
and more tha.n true communications 
with the gods, and particularly Jv euo-ian, 
in the act or at the time of sacrificing. 
I In this sense, then, it signifies that im- 
pulse of the mind which leads a man to 
suppose lie has some remarkable inter- 
course with the Deity, while at the same 
time it is nothing more than the effects 
of a heated imagination, or a sanguine 
constitution. 

That the Divine Being peranits his 
people to enjoy fellowship with him, 
and that he can work \\\wn the minds of 
his creatures when and how he pleases, 
cannot be denied. But, then, what is the 
criterion by which we are to judge, in 
order to distinguish it from enthusiasm * 
It is necessary there should be some 
rule, for without it the greatest extra- 
vagancies would be committed, the most 
notorious impostors countenanced, and 
the most enormous evils ensue. Now 
this criterion is the word of God ; from 
which we learn, that we are to expect 
no new revelations, no extraordinary 
gifts, as in the apostles' time ; that what- 
ever opinions, feelings, views, or im- 
pressions we may have, if they are in- 
consistent with reason, if they do not 
tend to humble us, if they do not in- 
fluence our temper, regulate our lives, 
and make us just, pious, honest, and 
uniform, they cannot come from God, 
but are evidently the effusions of an en- 
thusiastic brain. On the other liand, if 
the mind be enlightened, if the will 
which was perverse be renovated, de- 
tached from evil, and inclined to good ; 
if the powers be roused to exertion for 
the promotion of the divine glory, and 
the good of men ; if the natural cor- 
ruptions of the heart be suppressed ; if 
peace and joy arise from a view of the

goodness of God, attended with a spi- 
ritual frame of mind, a heart devoted to 
God, and a holy, useful life: however 
this may be branded with the name of 
enthusiasm, it certainly is from God,- 
because bare human efforts, unassisted 
by him, could never produce such ef- 
fects as these. Theol. Misc._ vol. ii. p. 
43. ; Locke on Underst. vol. ii. ch. 19. ; 
Sfiect. No. 201. vol. iii. ; Wesley's Ser. 
on Entlmsiasin ; Mrs. H. More's Hints

ENVY, a sensation of uneasiness and 
disquiet, arising from the advantages 
which others are supposed to possess 
above us, accompanied with malignity 
towardsthosewhopossessthem. "This, ' 
says a good writer, " is universally ad- 
mitted to be one of the blackest pa,ssions 
in the human heart. No one, indeed, is 
to be condemned for defending his rights, 
and showing displeasure against a ma- 
licious enemy ; but to conceive ill will 
at one who has attacked none of our 
rights, nor done us any injury, solely 
because he is more prosperous than we 
are, is a disposition altogether unnatural. 
Hence the character of an envious man 
is imiversally odious. All disclaim it; 
and they who feel themselves under the 
influence of this passion, carefully con- 
ceal it. The chief grounds of envy may 
be reduced to three : accomplishments 
of mind ; advantages of birth, rank, and 
fortune ; and superior success in worldlj- 
pursuits. To subdue this odious dispo- 
sition, let us consider its sinful and cri- 
minal nature ; the mischiefs it occasions 
to the world ; the unhappiness it pro- 
duces to him who possesses it ; the evil 
causes that nourish it, such as pride and 
indolence : let us, moreover, bring of- 
ten into view those religious considera- 
tions which regard us as Christians : 
how unworthy we are in the sight of 
God ; how much the blessings we en- 
joy are above what we deserve. Let 
us learn reverence and submission to 
that divine government which has ap- 
pointed to every one such a condition as 
IS fittest for him to possess ; let us con- 
sider how opposite the Christian spirit 
is to envy ; above all, let us offer up our 
prayers to the Almighty, that he would 
purify our hearts from a passion which 
is so base and so criminal. 

EONIANS, the followers of Eon, a 
wild fanatic, of the province of Bre- 
tagne, in the twelfth century : he con- 
cluded, from the resemblance between 
eu?n, in the form for exorcising malig- 
nant spirits, viz. " per eum qui venturus 
est judicare vivos et mortuos," and his 
own name Eon, that he was the son of 



God, and ordained to judge the quick 
and dead. Eon was, however, solemnly 
condemned by the council at Rheims, 
in 1148, and ended his days in a prison. 
He left behind him a number of follow- 
ers, whom persecution and death, so 
weakly and cruelly employed, could 
not persuade to abandon his cause, or to 
renounce an absurdity, which, says Mo- 
sheim, one would think, could never 
have gained credit but in such a place 
as Bedlam. 

EOQUINIANS, a denomination in 
the sixteenth centuiy ; so called from 
one Eoquinus, their master, who taught 
that Christ did not die for the wickeci, 
but for the faithful only. 

EPICUREANS, the disciples of Epi- 
cui-us, who flourished about A. M. 3700. 
This sect maintained that the world was 
formed not by God, nor with any de- 
sign, but by tKe fortuitous concourse of 
atoms. They denied that God governs 
the world, or in the least condescends 
to interfere with creatures below : they 
denied the immortality of the soul, and 
the existence of angels ; they maintained 
that happiness consisted m pleasure ; 
but some of them placed this pleasure 
in the tranquillity and joy of the mind 
arising from the practice of moral vir- 
tue, and which is thought by some to 
have been the true principle of Epicu- 
inis ; others understood him in the gross 
sense, and placed all their happiness in 
coi-poreal pleasure. When Paul was at 
Athens, he had conferences with the 
Epicurean philosophers. Acts xvii. 18. 
The word Kfiicurean is used, at present, 
for an indolent, effeminate, and volup- 
tuous person, who only consults his pri- 
vate and particular pleasure. See 
Academics. 

EPIPHANY, a Christian festival, 
otherwise called the manifestation of 
Christ to the Gentiles, observed on the 
6th of January, in honour of the appear- 
ance of our Saviour to the three magi, 
or wise men, who came to adore and 
bring him presents. 

EPISCOPACY, that foi-m of church 
government in which diocesan bishops 
are established as distinct from and su- 
perior to priests or presbyters. 

The controversy respecting episco- 
pacy commenced soon after the re- 
formation ; and has been agitated with 
great warmth, between the Episcopa- 
lians on the one side, and the Presbyte- 
rians and Independents on the other. 
Among the Protestant churches abroad, 
those which were reformed by Luther 
and his associates are in general episco- 
pal ; whilst such as follow the doctrines 
of Calvin, have for the most part 



Epr

thrown off the order of bishops as one 
of the corruptions of popery. In Eng- 
land, however, the controversy has 
been considered as of greater impor- 
tance than on the continent. It has 
been strenuously maintained by one 
party, that the episcopal order is essen- 
tial to the constitution of the church ; 
and by others, that it is a pernicious en- 
croachment on the rights of men, for 
which there is no authority in Scrip- 
ture. We will just briefly state their 
arguments. 

I. Episcopacy, arguments for. 1. 
Some argue that the nature of the office 
which the apostles bore was sucli, that 
the edification of the church would re- 
quire they should have some successors 
in those ministrations which are not 
common to Gospel ministei's. — 2. That 
Timothy and Titus were bishops of 
Ephesus and Crete, whose business it 
was to exercise such extraordinary acts 
of jurisdiction as are now claimed by 
diocesan bishops, 1 Tim. i. 3. Tim. iii. 
19, 22. 2 Tim. ii. 2. Tit. i. 5, &amp;c. Tit. 
iii. 10. — 3. Some have argued from the 
mention of angels, i. e. as they under- 
stand it, of diocesan bishops, in the 
seven churches of Asia, particularly the 
angel of Ephesus, though there were 
many ministers employed in it long be- 
fore the date of that epistle. Acts xx. 
17, 18. — 4. It is urged that some of the 
churches which were formed in large 
cities during the lives of the apostles, 
and especially that at Jeinisalem, con- 
sisted of such vast numbers as could not 
possibly assemble at one place. — 5. That 
m the writers who succeeded the inspi- 
red penmen, there is a multiplied and 
concurring evidence to prove the apos- 
tolic institution of episcopacy. 

II. Episcopacy, arguments against. 
1. To the above it is answered, that, as 
the office of the apostles was such as to 
require extraordinary and miraculous 
endowments for the discharge of many 

{)arts of it ; it is impossiljle that they can 
lave any successors in those ser\ices 
who are not empowered for the execu- 
tion of them as the apostles themselves 
.were ; and it is maintained, that so far 
as ordination, confirmation, and excom- 
munication, may be performed without 
miraculous gifts, there is nothing in 
them but what seems to suit the pasto- 
ral office in genei'al. 

2. That i imothy and Titus had not 
a stated residence in these churches, 
but only visited them for a time, 2 Tim. 
iv. 9, 13. Tit. iii. 12. It also appears, 
from other places in which the journeys 
of Timothy- and Titus are mentioned, 
that thev were a kind of itinerant offi- 



cers, called evangelists, who were as- 
sistants to the apostles; for there is 
great reason to believe the first epistle 
to Timothy was written prior to those 
fi'om Rome in the time of Paul's im- 
prisonment, as some think the second 
was also. To which we may add, that 
it seems probable, at least, that they 
had verv extraordinary gifts to furnish 
them for their superior offices, 1 Tim. 
iv. 14. Eph. iv. 11. 2 Tim. iv. 5. And 
though 1 imothy Avas with Paul when 
he took his leave of the elders of Ephe- 
sus (Acts XX.) the apostle gives not 
the least hint of any extraordinary 
power with which he was invested, nor 
says one word to engage^their obedience 
to him ; which is a very strong pre- 
sumption that no such relation did sub- 
sist, or was to take place. 

3. As to the angels of the seven 
churches in Asia, it is certain that, for 
anv thing which appears in our Lord's 
epistles to them (Rev. ii. and iii.) they 
might be no more than the pastors of 
single congregations with then- proper 
assistants. 

4. To the fourth argument it is an- 
swered, 1. That the word fiupiaJst may 
onlv signify great numbers, and may not 
be Intended to express that there were 
several times ten thousand, in an exact 
and literal sense: compare Luke, ch. 
xii. ver. 1. (Greek.) — 2. That no suffi- 
cient proof is brought from Scripture of 
there being such numbers of people in 
any particular place as this supposes ; 
for the myriads of believing Jews spoken 
of hi the preceding text, as well as the 
numbers mentioned. Acts ii. 41. Acts 
iv. 4, might very probably be those who 
were gathered' together at those great 
feasts from distant places, of which few 
might have their stated residence in that 
city. See Acts, ch. viii. ver. 1. — 3. _ If 
the number were so great as the objec- 
tion supposes, there might be, for any 
thing which appears in Scripture, seve- 
ral bishops in the same city, as there 
are among those \vho do net allow of 
diocesan episcopacy, several co-ordinate 
pastors, overseers, or bishops : and 
though Eusebius does indeed pretend to 
give us a catalogue of the bishops of Je- 
rusalem, it is to be remembered how 
the Christians had been dispersed from 
thence for a considerable time, at and 
after the Roman war, and removed into 
other parts, which must necessarily very 
much increase the uncertainty which 
Eusebius himself owns there was, as to 
the succession of bishops in most of the 
ancient sees. 

5. As to the ancient writers, it is ob- 
served, that though Clemens Romanus 



%idif' 



EPI 



166 



EPI 



recommends to the Corinthians the ex- 
ample of the Jewish church, where the 
high priest, ordinary priest, and Le- 
vites knew and obsei^ed their respec- 
tive otfices, yet he never mentions pres- 
byters and bishops as distinct, nor refers 
the contending Corinthians to any one 
ecclesiastical head as the centre of unity, 
Avhich he would probably have done if 
there had been any diocesan bishops 
among them ; nay, he seems evidently 
to speak of presbyters as exercising the 
episcopal office. See sec. xxxix. of" his 
epistle. — 2. ^Vs for Irenseus, it does not 
appear that he made any distinction be- 
tween bishops and presbyters. He does 
indeed mention the succession of bishops 
from the apostfes, which is reconcileable 
"with the supposition of their being pa- 
rochial, nor altogether irreconcileable 
with the su])position of joint pastors in 
those churches. — 3. It is allowed that 
Ignatius in many places distinguishes 
between bishops and presbyters, and re- 
quires obedience to bishops from the 
•whole chmxh, but as he often supposes 
each of the churches to which he wrote 
to meet in one place, and represents 
them as breaking one loaf, and sur- 
rounding one altar, and charges the bi- 
•shop to know all his flock by name, it 
is most evident that he must speak of a 

Parochial and not a diocesan bishop. — 4. 
olycarp exhorts the Christians at Phi- 
lippi to be subject to the presbyters and 
deacons, but says ivit one word about 
any bishop. — 5. Justin Martyr speaks of 
the firesidf.nt, but then he represents 
Jiim as being present at every admi- 
nistration of the eucharist, which he also 
mentions as always making a part of 
their public worship ; so that the bishop 
here must have only been the pastor of 
one congregation. — 6. TertuUian speaks 
of approved elders ; but there is nothing 
said of them that proves a diocesan, 
since a.11 he says might be applied to a 
parochial bishop. — 7. Though Clemens 
Alexandrinus speaks of bishops, priests, 
and deacons, yet it cannot be inferred 
from hence that the bishops of whom he 
speaks were any thing more tlian p:\ro- 
chial. — 8. Origen speaks distinctly of 
bishops and presbyters, but unites them 
both, as it seems, under the common 
name of priests, saying nothing of the 
power of bishops as extending beyond 
one congregation, and rather insinuates 
the contrary, wlien he speaks of of- 
fenders as brought before the whole 
church to be judged by it. — 9. The apos- 
tolic constitutions frequently distinguisli 
between bishops and presbyters; but 
these constitutions cannot be depended 
on, as they are supposed to be a forgery | 



of the fourth century. — 10. It is allowed 
that in succeeding ages, the difference 
between bishops and presbyters came 
to be more and more magnified, and 
various churches came under the care 
of the same bishop : nevertheless, Jerom 
does expressly speak of bishops and 
presbyters as of the same order; and 
Gregory Nazianzen speaks of the great 
and affecting distinction made between 
ministers in prerogative of place, and 
other tyraimical privileges (as he calls 
them,) as a lamentable and destructive 
thing. 

III. Episcopacy, honv introduced. — 
It is easy to apprehend how episcopacy, 
as it was in the primitive church, with 
those alterations which it afterwards 
received, might be gradually intro- 
duced. The apostles seem to have 
taught chiefly in large cities ; they set- 
tled ministers there, who, preaching in 
country villages, or smaller towns, in- 
creased the number of converts: it 
would have been most reasonable that 
those new converts, which lay at a con- 
siderable distance from the large towns, 
should, when they grew numerous, 
have formed themselves into distinct 
churches, under tlie care of their pro- 
per pastors or bishops, independently 
of any of their neighbours ; but the re- 
verence which would naturally be paid 
to men who had conversed with the 
apostles, and perhaps some desire of in- 
fluence and dominion, from which the 
hearts of very good men might not be 
entirely free, and which early began to 
work, (John iii. 9. 2 Thess. ii. 7,) might 
easily lay a foundation for such a subor- 
dination in the ministers of neiv erected 
churches to those which were more 
ancient ; and much more easily might 
the superiority of a pastor to his assis- 
tant presbyters increase, till it at length 
came to that great difference which we 
own was early made, and probably soon 
carried to an excess. And if there were 
that degi-ee of degeneracy in the church, 
and defection from the purity and vi- 
gour of religion, which the learned 
Vitringa supposes to have happened 
between the time of Nero and Trajan, 
it would be less surprising that those 
evil principles, which occasioned epis- 
copal, and at length the papal usurpa- 
tion, should before that time exert some 
considerable influence. 

IV. Epiacopacy, reduced, plan of. 
Archbishop Usher projected a plan for 
the reduction of episcopacy, by which 
he wouJd have moderated it in such a 
manner as to have brought it ver\' near 
the Presbyterian government of the 
Scotch church; the weekly parochial

the Chorefiiscopi answering to their 
presbyteries; the diocesan synod to their 
provincial, and the national to their ge-

Englancl, is but a faint shadow of the

EPISTLES OF BARNABAS. See 
Barnabas. 

EQUANIMITY is an even, uniform 
state of mind, amidst all the vicissitudes 
of time and changes of circumstances 
to which we are subject in the present 
state. One of this disposition is not de- 
jected when under adversity, nor elated 
when in the height of prosperity : he is 
equally affable to others, and contented 
in himself. The excellency of this dis- 
position is beyond all praise. It may be 
considered as the gi-and remedy for all 
the diseases and miseries of life, and the 
only way by which we can preserve the 
dignity of our characters as men and as 
Christians. 

EQUITY is that exact rule of righ- 
teousness or justice, which is to be ob- 
ser\'ed between man and man. Our 
Lord beautifully and comprehensively 
expresses it in these words ; " All things 
whatsoever ye would that men should 
do unto you, do ye even so to them, for 
this is the law and the prophets," Matt. 
vii. 12. This golden inile, says Dr. 
Watts, has many excellent properties 
in it. 1. It is a i-ule that is easy X.00&amp; un- 
derstood, and as easy to be applied by 
the meanest and weakest understand- 
ing, Isa. xxxv. 8. — 2. It is a very short 
rule, and easy to be remembered : the 
weakest memory can retain it : and the 
meanest of mankind may carry this 
about with them, and have it ready 
upon all occasions. — 3. This excellent 
precept carries greater evidence to the 
conscience, and a stronger degree of 
conviction in it, than any other nile of 
moral virtue. — 4. It is particularly fitted 
for practice, because it includes in it a 
powerful motive to stir us up to do what 
It enjoins. — 5. It is such a inile as, if 
well applied, wiU almost always secure 



our neighbour from injury, and secure 
us from guilt if we should chance to 
hurt him. — 6. It is a rule as much fitted 
to awaken us to sincei'e repentance, 
upon the transgression of it, as it is to 
du-ect us to our present duty. — 7. It is 
a most extensive rule, witli regard to 
all the stations, ranks, and characters 
of mankind, for it is perfectly suited to 
them all. — 8. It is a most comprehen- 
sive rule with regard to all the actions 
and duties that concern our neighbours. 
It teaches us to regulate our temper 
and behaviour, and promote tenderness, 
benevolence, gentleness, 5cc. — 9. It is 
also a rule of the highest prudence with 
regard to ourselves, and promotes our 
own interest in the best manner. — 10, 
This iiile is fitted to make the whole 
world as happy as the present state of 
things will admit. See JVatts's Ser?noTis, 
ser. 33. v. i. ; Evan's Ser. ser. 28 ; Mor- 
ning Exercises at Cripfi legate, ser. 10. 

EQUIVOCATION, the using a term 
or expi'ession that has a double mean- 
ing. Equivocations ai-e said to be ex- 
pedients to save telling the truth, and 
)'et without telling a falsity ; but if an 
intention to deceive constitute the es- 
sence of a lie, v/hich in general it does, 
I cannot conceive how it can be done 
without incurring guilt, as it is certainly 
an intention to deceive. 

ERASTIANS, so called from Eras- 
tus, a German divine of the 16th cen- 
tury. The pastoral office, according to 
him, was only persuasive, like a pro- 
fessor of science over his students, with- 
out any pov/er of the keys annexed. 
The Lord's supper and other ordinan- 
ces of the Gospel were to be free and 
open to all. The minister might dissuade 
the vicious and unqualified from the 
communion ; but might not refuse it, or 
inflict any kind of censure ; the punish- 
ment of all oflences, either of a civil or 
religious nature, being refeired to the 
civil magistrate. 

ERROR, a mistake of our judgment, 
giving assent to that which is not true. 
Mr. Locke reduces the causes of error 
to four. 1. Want of proofs. — 2. Want of 
ability to use them. — 3. Want of will to 
use them. — 4. Wrong measures of pro- 
bability. In a moral and scriptural sense 
it signifies sin. See Sin. 

EbSENES, a very ancient sect, that 
was spread abroad through Syria, 
Egypt, and the neighbouring countries. 
They maintained that religion consisted 
wholly in contemplation and silence. 
Some of them passed their lives in a 
state of celibacy ; others embraced the 
state of matrimony, which they consi- 
dered as lawful, when entered into with 



EST

the sole design of propagating the spe- 
cies, and not to s.itisty the demand of 
lust. Some of them held the possibihty 
of appeasing the Deity by sacrifices, 
though different from that of tlie Jews ; 
and others maintained that no offering 
was acceptable to God but that of a 
serene and composed mind, addicted 
to the contemplation of divine things. 
They looked upon the law of Moses as 
an allegorical system of spiritual and 
mysterious truths ; and renounced, in 
its explication, all regard to the out- 
ward letter. 

ESTABLISHMENTS, Religious. 
By a religious establishment-is generally 
understood such an intimate connection 
between religion and civil government 
as is supposed to secure the best inte- 
rests and great end of both. This arti- 
cle, like many others, has afforded mat- 
ter of considerable dispute. In order 
that the reader may judge for himself, 
we shall take a view of both sides of the 
question. 

The partisans for religious establish- 
ments observe, that they have prevail- 
ed universally in every age and nation. 
The ancient patriarchs formed no ex- | 
tensive or peraianent associations but I 
such as arose from the relationships of j 
nature. Every fatlier governed his own 
family, and their offspring submitted to 
his jurisdiction. He presided in their 
educatipn and discipline, in their reli- 
gious worship, and in their general go- 
vernment. His knowledge and expe- 
rience handed down to them their laws 
and their customs, both civil and reli- 
gious ; and his authority enforced them. 
The offices of prophet, priest, and king, 
were thus united in the same patriarch, 
Gen. xviii. 19. Gen. xvii. and xxi. Gen. 
xiv. 18. The Jews enjoyed a religious 
establishment dictated aiid ordained by 
God. In turning our attention to the 
heathen nations we shall find the same 
incorporation of religious with civil go- 
vernment, Gen. xlvi'i. 22. 2 Kings xvii. 
27, 29. Every one who is at all ac- 
quainted with the history of Greece and 
Rome, knows that religion was altoge- 
ther blended with the policy of the 
state. The Koran may be considered 
as the religious creed and civil code of 
all the Mahometan tribes. Among the 
Celtes, or the original inhabitants of 
Europe, the dmids were both their 
priests and their judges, and their judg- 
ment was final. Among the Hindoos, 
the priests and sovereigns are of differ- 
ent tribes or casts, but the priests are 
superior in rank; and in China, the 
emperor is sovereign pontiff, and pre- 
sides in all public acts of religion. 



Again ; it is said, that, although thcBe 
is no form of church government iibso- 
lutely prescribed in the New Testament, 
yet from the associating law, on which 
the Gospel lays so much stress, by the 
respect for ci\nl government it so ear- 
nestly enjoins, and by the practice which 
followed, and finally prevailed. Chris- 
tians cannot be said to disapprove, but 
to favour religious establishments. 

Religious establishments, also, it is 
observed, are founded in the nature of 
man, and interwoven with all the con- 
stituent principles of human society : the 
knowledge and profession of Christian- 
ity cannot be upheld without a clergy ; 
a clergy cannot be supported without a 
legal provision ; and a legal provision 
for the clergy cannot be constituted 
without the preference of one sect of 
Christians to the rest. An established 
church is most likely to maintain cleri- 
cal respectability and usefulness, by 
holding out a suitable encouragement 
to young men to devote themselves 
early to the service of the church ; and 
likewise enables them to obtain such 
knowledge as shall qualify them for the 
important work. 

They who reason on the contrary side 
observe, that the patriarchs sustaining 
civil as well as religious offices, is no 
proof at all that religion was incorpo- 
rated with the civil government, in the 
sense above referred to ; nor is there 
the least hint of it in the sacred Scrip- 
tures. That the case of the Jews can 
never be considered in point, as they 
were under a theocracy, and a ceremo- 
nial dispensation that was to pass away, 
and consequently not designed to be.a 
model for Christian nations. That what- 
ever was the practice of heathens in 
this respect, this forms no argument in 
favour of that system which is the veiy 
opposite to paganism. The church of 
Christ is of a spiritual nature, and ought 
not, yea cannot, in fact, be incorporated 
with the state without sustaining mate- 
rial injury. In the three first and pu- 
rest ages of Christianity, the church 
was a stranger to any alliaiice with tem- 
poral powers ; and, so far from need- 
mg their aid, religion never flourished 
so much as while they were combined 
to suppress it. As to the support which 
Christianity, when united to civil go- 
vernment yields to the peace and 
good order of society, it is observed, 
that this benefit will be derived from it, 
at least, in as great a degree without 
an establishment as with it. Religion, 
if it have any power, operates on the 
conscience of men; and, resting solely 
on the belief of invisible realities, it can

derive no weight or solemnity from hu- 
man sanctions. Human establishments, 
it is said, have been, and are, pi'odnctive 
of the greatest evils ; for in this case it 
is I'equisite to give the preference to 
some particular system ; and as the 
magistrate is no better judge of religion 
than others, the chances are as gi-eat of 
his lending his sanction to the false as 
the true. The thousands that have been 
persecuted and suffered in consequence 
of establishments, will always form an 
argument against them. Under estab- 
lishments also, it is said, corruption can- 
not be avoided. Emolument must be 
attached to tbe national church, which 
may be a strong inducement to its mi- 
nisters to defend it, he it ever so remote 
from the truth. Thus, also, error be- 
comes permanent ; and that set of opi- 
nion"-. which happens to prevail when 
the establishment is formed, continues, 
in spite of superior light and improve- 
ment, to be handed down, without al-' 
teration, from age to age. Hence the 
disagreement between the public creed 
of the church and the private senti- 
ments of its ministers. As to the pro- 
vision made for the clergy, this may be 
done without an establishment, as mat- 
ter of fact shows in hundreds of in- 
stances. Dissenting ministei-s, or those 
who do not hold in establishments, it is 
observed are not without means of ob- 
taining knowledge ; but, on tlit contrary, 
many of them are equal to their bre- 
thren in the establishment for erudition 
and sound learning. It is not to be dis- 
sembled neither, that among those who, 
in general, cannot agree with human 
establishments, there ai'e as pious and 
as useful members of society as others. 
Finally, though all Christians should pay 
respect to civil magistrates as such, and 
all magistrates ought to encourage the 
church, yet no civil magistrates have 
any power to estal)rish any particular 
form of religion, binding upon the con- 
sciences of the subject ; nor are magis- 
trates even represented in scripture as 
officers or rulers of the church. Should 
the reader be desirous of prosecuting 
this subject farther, he may consult

ESTEEM is that high and exaltetl 
thought of, and value for any thing 
which arises fi'om a sense of its own in- 
trinsic worth and excellency. Esteem is 
higher than simple approbation, which 
is a decision of the judgment ; it is the 
commencement of affection : it is a de- 
gree of love for others, on account of 
their pleasing qualities, though they 
should not immediately intci-est our- 
seh'es ; by which it is distinguished from 
gratitude. Our esteem of God manifests 
itself in never mentioning his name 
without reverence; in boAving the knee; 
in ]:)rayer and praise ; .in all the several 
forms of outward devotion, and in quick 
resentment of any dislionour done to 
him. Our high esteem or veneration 
of anv man appears in an humble, re- 
spectful behaviour tov/ard him, speak- 
ing his praises, imitating his excellen- 
cies, and resenting iiis dishonour, 

ETERNITY, with respect to God, 
is a duration without beginning or end. 
As it is the attribute of human nature, 
it is a duration that has a beginning, but 
will never have an end. " It is a dura- 
tion," says a lively writer, "that ex- 
cludes all number and computation : 
days, and months, and years, yea, and 
ages, are lost in it, like drops in the 
ocean ! Millions of millions of years, as 
many years as there are sands on the 
sea-shore, or particles of dust in the 
globe of the earth, and those multiplied 
to the highest reach of number, all these 
are nothmg to eternity. They do not 
bear the least imaginable proportion to 
it; for these will come to an end, as 
certainly as a day ; but eternity will 
never, never, never, come to an end' 
It is a line without end ' it is an ocean 
without a shore! Alas I what shall I 
say of it! it is an infinite, unknown 
something, that neither human thought 
can grasp, nor human language de- 
scribe!" Orton on Fjrrnity; Shower 
on ditto: Davis's ServTons, ser. 11; 
Saurin's Sermons, vol. iii. p. 370. 

ETERNITY OF GOD is the per- 
petual continuance of his being, without 
beginning, end, or succession. That he 
is without beginning, says Dr. Gill, mav 
be i)roved from, 1. His necessary self- 
existence, Exod. iii. 14. — 2. From his 
attributes, several of which are said to 
be eternal, Rom. i. 20. Acts xv. 18. 
Ps. ciii. 17. Jer. xxxi. 3. — 3. From his 
purposes, which are also said to be from 
eteniitv, Isa. xxv. 1. Eph. iii. 11. Rom. 
ix. 11. 'Eph. i. 4. — 4. From the covenant 
of grace, which is eternal, 2 Sam. xxiii, 
5. iA\c. v. 2. 

Thiit he is without end, may be prov- 
ed frrim, 1. His spiritual itv and simpli-

city, Rom. i. 23. — 2. From liis indepen- 
dency, Rom. ix. 5. — 3. From his immu- 
tability, 2 Pet. i. 24, 25. Mal.iii. 6. Psal. 
iii. 26, 27. — 4. From his dominion and 
government, said never to end, Jer. x. 
10. Psal. X. 16. Dan. iv. 3. 

That he is rjithout succession, or any 
distinctions of time succeeding one to 
another, as moments, minutes, &amp;:c. may 
be proved from, 1. His existence before 
such were in being, Isa. xliii. 13. — 2. 
The distinctions and differences of time 
are together ascribed to him, and not as 
succeeding one another: he is the same 
yesterday, to-day, and for ever, Heb. 
xiii. 8. Rev. i. 4. — 3. If his duration 
were successive, or pi'oceeded by mo- 
ments, days, and vears, then there must 
have been some first moment, day, and 
year, when he began to exist, which is 
m(*mpatible witli the idea of his eter- 
nity ; and, besides, one day would be 
but one day witli him, and not a thou- 
sand, contrary to the express language 
of Scripture, 2 Pet. iii. 8. — 4. He would 
not be immense, immutable, and per- 
fect, if this were the case ; for he would 
be older one minute than he v.-as before, 
which cannot be said of him. — 5. His 
knov/ledge proves liim without succes- 
sive duration, for he knows all things 
past, present, a:ul to come: "he sees 
the present without a medium, the past 
without recollection, and the future 
without foresight. To him all trutlis 
are but one idea, all places are but one 
point, and all times but one moment."

ETERNITY OF THE WORLD. 
It was the opinion of Aristotle and others 
that the world w.as eternal. But that 
the present system of things had a be- 
ginning, seems evident, if we consider 
the following tilings. 1. We may not 
only conceive of many possible altera- 
tions which might be made in the form 
of it, but we see it incessantly changing ; 
whereas an eternal being, forasmuch 
as it is self-existent, is always tlie same. 
— 2. We have no credible history of 
transactions more remote tiian six thou- 
sand years from the present time ; for 
as to the pretence that some nations 
have made to histories of greater anti- 
miity, as the Kg-yjitians, Chaldeans, 
Ph(enicians, Chinese, &amp;c. they are evi- 
dently convicted of fulseiiood in the 
works referred to at the bottom of this 
article. — 3. We can trace the invention 
of the most useful arts and sciences; 
which had probably been carried far- 
tlicr, and in\entcd sooner, had the 



world been eternal. — 4. The origin of 
the most considerable nations of the 
earth m;;y be traced, i. c. the time when 
they first inlialjited the countries where 
they now dwell ; and it appears that 
most of the western nations came from 
the east. — 5. If the world be eteraal, it 
is hard to account for the tradition of 
its beginning, which has almost every 
where jirevailed, though undei different 
forms, amon|r both polite and barbarous 
nations. — 6. We have a most ancient 
and credible history of the beginning of 
the world : I mean the histoi-}- of Mo- 
ses, with which no book in the world, 
in poMit of antiquity, can contend. Stil-

ETHICS, the doctrine of manners, 
or the science of moral philosophy. 
The word is formed from nSos, mci-es, 
"manners," by reason the scope or ob- 
ject thereof is to form the manners. 
See Morals. 

ETHNOPHRONES, a sect of here- 
tics in the seventh century, who made a 
profession of Christianity, but joined 
thereto all the ceremonies and follies 
of paganism, as judicial astrology, sorti- 
lee.es, auguries, and other divinations. 

EVA:SiGELlST, one who publishes 
glad tidings ; a messenger, or preacher 
of good news. The persons denomi- 
nated evangelists were next in order to 
tlie apostles, and were sent by them not 
to settle in any particular place, but to 
travel among the infant cliurches, and 
ordain ordinary officers, and finish what 
the apostles had begun. Of this kind 
were Philip the deacon, Mark, Silas, 
&amp;c. Acts xxi. 8. The title of evange- 
list is more particularly given to the 
four inspired writers of our Saviour's 
life. 

EVANGELICAL, agreeable to the 
doctrines of Christianity. The term is 
frequently applied to those who do not 
rely upon moral duties as to their ac- 
ceptance Avith (iod ; but are influenced 
to action from a sense of the love of 
God, and depend upon the merits of 
Christ for their everlasting salvation. 

EUCHARIST, the sacrament of the 
I^ord's supper. The word properly sig- 
nifies giving thanks. As to the man- 
ner of celebrating the eucharist among 
the ancient Christians, after the custo- 
mary oblations were made, the deacon 
brought water to the bishops and pres- 
byters standing round t)ie table to wash 



EUC

their hands ; according to that passage 
of the Psalmist, "I will wash my hands 
in innocency, and so will I compass thy 
altar, O Lord." Then the deacon cried 
out aloud, "Mutually embrace and kiss 
each other;" which being done, the 
■whole congregation pra\-ed for the uni- 
\-ersal peace and welfare of the church, 
for the ti-anquillity and repose of the 
woi'ld, for the prosperity of the age, 
for wholesome weatlier, and for all 
ranks and degrees of men. After this 
followed mutual salutations of the mi- 
nister and people ; and then the bishop 
or presbyter, having sanctified the ele- 
ments by a solemn benediction, broke 
the bread, and delivered it to the dea- 
con, who distributed it to the communi- 
cants, and after that the cup. The sa- 
cramental wine was usually diluted or 
mixed with water. During the time of 
administration thev sang h} mns and 
psalms; and having concluded with 
prayer and thanksgiving, the peoi)le 
saluted each ether with a kiss of peace, 
and so the assembly broke up. 

EUCHITES, orEucHiT.E, a sect of 
ancient heretics, who were first formed 
into a religious bod}' towards the end of 
the fourth centur}', though their doc- 
trine and discipline subsisted in Syria, 
P^g)'pt, and other eastern countries, be- 
foi'e the birth of Christ : they were thus 
called, because the}' pra}ed without 
ceasing, imagining that prayer alone 
was sufficient to save them. The}'' were 
a sort of mystics, who imagined, ac- 
cording to the oriental notion, that two 
souls resided in man, the one good, and 
the other evil ; and who were zealous 
ill ex])elling the evil soul or demon, 
and hastening the return of the good 
Spirit of God, by contemplation, prayer, 
and singing of hymns. They also em- 
braced opinions nearly resembling the 
Manichean doctrine, and which they 
■derived from the tenets cf the oriental 
philosophy. The same denomination 
was used 5n the twelfth centuiy to de- 
note certain fanatics who infested the 
Greek and Eastern churches, and who 
were charged with believing a double 
trinity, rejecting wedlock, abstaining 
from flesh, treating with contempt the 
sacraments of baptism and tlie Lord's 
supper, and the various bi-anches ' of 
external worship, and placing the es- . 
sence of religion solely hi external 
prayer; and maintaining the efficacy of 
pei-petual supplications to the Supreme 
Being for expelling an evil being or 
genius, which dwelt in the breast of 
every mortal. This sect is said to have 
been founded by a person called Luco- 
iietrus, whose chief disciple was named 1 



Tychiciis. By degi-ees it become a ge- 
neral and invidious appellation for per- 
sons of eminent piety and zeal for ge- 
nuine Chi'istianit}-, who opposed the vi- 
cious practices and insolent tyranny of 
the priesthood, much in the same man- 
ner as the Latins comprehended all the 
adversaries of the Roman pontiff under 
the general terms of Albigenses and 
Waldenses. 

EUDOXIANS, a sect in the fourth 
century ; so called from their leader 
Eudoxius, patriarch of Antioch and 
Constantinople, a great defender of the 
Arian doctrine. The Eudoxians believ- 
ed that the Son was created out of no- 
thing ; that he had a will distinct and 
different from that of the Father, &amp;c. 
They held many other tenets of the 
Arians and Eunomians. 

EVIDENCE, is that perception of 
truth which arises either from the tes- 
timony of the senses, or from an induc- 
tion of reason. The evidences of reve- 
lation are divided into internal and ex- 
ternal. That is called i77?e7'wa/ evidence 
which is drawn from the consideration 
of those declarations and doctrines 
which are contained in it ; and that is 
called external, which arises from some 
other circuri stances referring to it, 
such as predictions concerning it, mira- 
cles wrought by those who teach it, its 
success in the world, &amp;c. See Eviden- 
ces of Christ, art. Christianity. 

Moral evidence is that which, though 
it does not exclude a mere abstract pos- 
sibility of things being othcKwise, yet 
siiuts out every reasonable ground of 
suspecting that they are so. 

Evidences of Grace are those dispo- 
sitions and acts which prove a person to 
be in a converted state ; such as an en- 
lightened understanding; love to God 
and his people; a delight m God's 
word; worship and dependence on him ; 
spirituality of mind; devotedness of life 
to the service of God, 8cc. Seed's Post.

EVIL is distinguished into natural 
and moral. JVatural evil is whatever 
destroys or any way disturbs the ]ier- 
fection of natural beings; such as blind- 
ness, diseases, death, &amp;c. Moral evil is 
the disagreement between the actions 
of a moral agent, and the rule of those 
actions, whatever it is. Applied to a 
choice, or acting contrary to the moral 
or revealed laws of the Deity, it is 
termed wickedness or sui. Applied to 
acting contrary to the mere rule of 
fitness, a fault. See article Sin.

EVIL SPEAKING, the using lan- 
guage either reproachful or untrue re- 
specting others, and thereby injuring 
tnem. It is an express command of 
Scripture, "To speak evil of no man." 
Titus iii. 2. James iv. 11. By which, 
howev^er, we are not to understand that 
there are no occasions on which we are 
at liberty to speak of others that which 
may be considered as evil. 1. Persons in 
the administration of justice may speak 
■woi'ds which in prn'ate intercourse 
would be reproachful. — 2. God's minis^- 
ters may inveigh against vice with 
sharpness and seventh', both privately 
and publicly, Is. Iviii. 1 Tit, i. 13. — 3. Pri- 
vate persons may reprove others when 
they commit sin. Lev. xix. 17. — 4. Some 
vehemence of speech may be used in de- 
fence of truth, and impugning eiTors of 
bad consequence, Jude 3. — 5. It may be 
iiecessar)', upon some emergent occa- 
sions, with some heat of language, to ex- 
press disapprobation of notorious wick- 
edness. Acts viii. 23. Yet in all these the 
greatest equity, moderation, and can- 
dour, should be used; and we should 
take care, 1. Never to speak in severe 
terms without reasonable warrant or ap- 
parent just cause ; — 2. Nor beyond mea- 
sure ; — 3. Nor out of bad principles or 
wrong ends ; for ill will, contempt, re- 
venge, envy, to compass our own ends ; 
from Avantonness, or negligence, but 
from pure charit}' for the good of those 
to whom or of whom we sjjeak. 

This ig an evU, however, which great- 
ly abounds, and which is not sufficiently 
watched against ; for it is not when we 
openly speak evil of others only that we 
are guilty, but even in speaking what is 
true we are in danger of speaking evil 
of others. There is sometimes a malig- 
nant pleasure manifested ; a studious 
recollection of every thing that can be 
brought forward; a delight in hearing 
any thing spoken against others ; a se- 
cret rejoicing in knowing that another's 
fall will be an occasion of our rise. All 
this is base to an extreme. 

The iynprofirkty and sinfulness of 
evil speaking will appear, if we consi- 
der, 1. That it is entirely opposite to 
the whole tenor of the Christian reli- 
gion. — 2. Expressly condemned and 
prohibited as evil, Ps. Ixiv. 3. James iv. 
11. — 3. No practice hath more severe 
punishments denounced against it, 1 Cor. 
V. 11. 1 Cor. vi. 10 — 4. It is an evidence 

of a weak and distempered mind. 5. It 

is e^en indicative of ill-breeding and bad 
manners. — 6. It is the abhorrence of all 
•wise and good men, Ps. xv. 3. — 7. It is 
exceedingly injurious to society, and in- 
CQP-sis^ent &gt;vith the relation we bear to 



each other as Christians, James iii. 6 ., 

8. It is branded with the epithet of folly, 
Prov. xviii. 6, 7. — 9. It is penerting the 
design of speech. — 10. It is opposite to 
the example of Christ, Avhoni we pro- 
fess to follow. See Slander. Barrow's 
Works, vol. i. ser. 16. Tillotson's Ser. 
ser. 42. Jack's Ser. on Evil S/7eaki?ig. 

EULOGY, eiclog-ia,a term made use 
of in reference to the consecrated bread. 
When the Greeks have cut a loaf or 
piece of bread to conseci-ate it, they 
break the rest into little bits, and distri- 
bute it among the persons who have not 
5'et communicated, or send it to persons 
that are absent : and these pieces of 
bread are what they call eulogies. The 
word is Greek, iuK^'yia, formed of eu, bene, 
" well," and kzj^, dico, " I say, speak ;" 
q. d. benedictU7n, " blessed." 

The Latin church has had something 
like eulogies for a great many ages; and 
thence arose the use of their uoly bread. 
The name eulogy was likewise given to 
loaves or cakes brought to church by 
the faithful to have them blessed. Last- 
ly, the use of the term passed hence to 
mere presents made to a person with- 
out any benediction. 

EUNOMIANS, a sect in the fourth 
century. They were a branch of Arians, 
and took their name from Eunomius, 
bishop of Cyzicus. Cave, in his Histo- 
ria Literaria, vol. i. p. 223, gives the fol- 
lowing account of their faith. " There 
is one God, uncreated and without be- 
ginning ; who has nothing existing be- 
fore him, for nothing can exist before 
what is uncreated ; nor with him, for 
what is uncreated must be one ; nor in 
him, for God is a simple and uncom- 
pounded being. This one simple and 
eternal being is God, the creator and 
ordainer of all things ; first indeed, and 
principally of his only begotten Son; and 
then through him of all other things. 
For God begat, created, and made the 
Son only by his direct opera.tion and 
power, before all things, and every 
other creature ; not producing, how- 
ever, any being like himself, or impart- 
ing any of his own proper substance to 
the Son ! for God is immortal, uniform, 
indivisible ; and therefore cannoi com- 
municate any part of his own proper 
substance to another. He alone is un- 
begotten ; and it is impossible that any- 
other being should be formed of an un- 
begotten substance. He did not use his 
own substance in begetting the Son, but 
his will only ; nor did he beget him in 
the likeness of his substance, but aC' 
cording to his own good pleasure; he 
then created the Holy Spirit, the first 
and greatest of all spirits, by his own 



EUT

f)Ower, in deed and operation mediate- 
y; yet by tlie immediate power and 
operation of the Son. After the Holy 
Spirit, he created all otlier thins^s, in 
heaven and in earth, visible and invisi- 
ble, coi-poreal and incoi-poreal, mediate- 
ly bv himself, by the power and opera- 
tion of the Son, Sec." The ftader will 
evidently see how near these tenets are 
to those "of Arianism. See Arians. 

EUSEBIANS, a denomination given 
to the Arians, on account of the favour 
and countenance which Eusebius, bishop 
of Cxsarea, showed and procured for 
them at their first rise. 

EUSTATHIANS, a name given to 
the Catholics of Antioch, in the fourth 
century, on occasion of their refusing to 
acknowledge any other bishop beside 
St. Eustathius, deposed bv the Arians. 

EUSTATHIANS, a sedt in the fourth 
century, so denominated from their foun- 
der, Eustathius, a monk so foolishly fond 
of his own profession, that he condemn- 
ed all other conditions of life. Whether 
this Eustathius were the same with the 
bishop of Sabastia, and chief of the Se- 
mi-arians, is not easy to determine. He 
excluded married people from salva- 
tion ; prohibited his followers from pray- 
ing in their houses, and obliged them to 
quit all they had, as incompatible with 
the hopes of heaven. He drew them out 
of the other assemblies of Christians, to 
hold secret ones with him, and made 
them wear a partictilar habit : he ap- 
pointed them to fast on Sundays ; and 
taught them that the ordinarj^ fasts of 
the church were needless after they had 
attained to a certain degree of purity 
which he pretended to. He showed 
great horror for chapels built in honour 
of mart}Ts, and the assemblies held 
therein. He was condemned at the 
council of Gangra, in Paphlagonia, held 
between the vear 326 and 341. 

EUTUCHITES, a denomination in 
the third century ; so called from the 
Greek eutuxeiv, which signifies to live 
without pain, or in pleasure. Among 
other sentiments, they held that our 
souls are placed in our bodies only to 
honour the angels who created them ; 
and that we ought to rejoice equally in 
all events, because to grieve would be 
to dishonour the angels, their creators. 

EUTYCHIANS, ancient heretics, 
who denied the duplicity of natures in 
Christ ; thus denominated from Euty- 
ches, the archimandrite or abbot of a 
monastery, a.t Constantinople, who he- 
gan to projjagate his opinion about A. D. 
448. He did not, however, seem quite 
steady and consistent in his sentiments ; 
for he appeared to allovi' of two uatui-cs. 



even before the union, which was ap- 
joarently a consecjuence he drew from 
the principles of the Platonic philoso- 
phy, which supposes a pre-existence of 
soiils:' accordingly he believed that tlie 
soul of Jesus Christ had been united to 
the Divinity before the incarnation ; but 
then he allowed no distinction of natures 
in Jesus Christ since his incarnation. 
This heresy was first condemned in a 
synod held at Constantinople, by Fla- 
vian, in 448 ; approved by the council 
of Ephesus, called conventus latromaii, 
in 449 ; and re-examined and fulminated 
in the general council of Chalcedon, in 
451. The Eutychians were divided into 
several branches, as the Agnoetee, Theo- 
dosians, Sex'eriayis, &amp;c. 8cc. Sec. Euty- 
chians was also the name of a sect, half 
Arian and half Eunomian, which arose 
at Constantinople in the fourth century. 

EXALTATION OF CHRIST con- 
sisted in his rising again from the dead 
on the third day, in ascending up into 
heaven, in sitting at the right hand of 
God the Father, and in coming to judge 
the world at the last day. See ai'ticles 
Resurrection, Ascension, Inter- 
cession, and Judg3ient-Day. 

EXAMINATION, Self. See Self- 
Examinatioic. 

EXAMPLE, a copy or pattern. In a 
moral sense, is either taken for a type, 
instance, or precedent for our admoni- 
tion, that we may be cautioned against 
the faults or ci'imes which others have, 
committed, by the bad consequences 
which have ensued from them ; or ex- 
ample is taken for a pattern for our 
imitation, or a model for us to copy 
after. 

That good examples have a peculiar' 
power above naked precepts to dispose 
us to the practice of virtue and holiness, 
may appear by considering, " 1. That 
they most clearly express to us the na- 
ture of our duties in their subjects and 
sensible effects. General precepts form 
abstract ideas of virtue ; but in exam- 
ples, virtues are most visible in all their 
circumstances. — 2. Precepts instruct us 
in what things are our duty, but exam- 
ples assure us that they are possible. — 
3. Examples, bv secret and lively incen- 
tive, urge us to imitation. We are touch- 
ed in another manner by the A-isiblc 
practice of good men, which reproaches 
our defects, and obliges us to the same 
zeal, which laws, though wise and good, 
will not effect." 

The life of Jesus Christ forms the 
most beautiful example the Christian 
can imitate. Unlike all otliers, it was 
absolutely perfect and uniform, and eve- 
ry ^vay accommodated to our present

state. In him we behold all light with- 
out a shade, all beauty without a spot, 
all the purity of the law, and the excel- 
lency ot the Gospel. Here we see piety 
■without superstition, and morality with- 
out ostentation; humility without mean- 
ness, and fortitude Avithout temerity ; 
patience without apathy, and compas- 
sion without weakness ; zeal without 
rashness, and beneficence witliout pro- 
digality. The obligation we are under to 
imitate this example arises from duty, 
relationship, engagement, interest, and 
gratitude. See article Jesus Christ. 
Those who set bad examples iihould 
consider, 1. That they are the ministers 
of the devil's designs to destroy souls. — 
2. That they are acting in direct oppo- 
sition to Christ, who came to save, and 
not to destroy. — 3. That they are add- 
ing to the miseries and calamities v/hich 
are alread}' in the world. — 4. That the 
effects of their example may be inc;d- 
culable on society to the end of time, 
and perhaps in eternity ; for who can 
tell what may Ije the consequence of 
one sin, on a family, a nation, or poster- 
ity? — 5. They are acting contrary to the 
divine command, and thus exposing 
themselves to final ruin. Masfsillon^s

EXARCH, an officer in tlie Greek 
church, whose business it is to visit the 
provinces allotted to him, 'n\ order to in- 
form himself of the lives and manners 
of the clergy ; take cognizance of eccle- 
siastical causes ; the manner of cele- 
brating divine service ; the administra- 
tion of the sacraments, particularly con- 
fession ; the observance of the canons ; 
monastic discipline ; affairs of mama- 
ges, divorces, &amp;;c. but above all, to take 
an account of the several re\'enucs 
•which tlie patriarch receives from se- 
veral churciies, and particularly as to 
Avhat regards collecting the same. The 
exarch, after having enriched himself 
in his post, frequently rises to the patri- 
archate himself. Exarch is also used 
in the Eastern church antiquitv, for a 
general or superior o\'er severalmonas- 
teries, the same that we call archiman- 
drite; being exempted bv the patriarch 
of Constantinople from the jurisdiction 
of the bishop. 

EXCISION, the cutting off a person 
from fellowship vvith the commimity to 
which he belongs, by w£'_y of punish- 
ment for some sin committed. The 
Jevv's, Selden informs us, reckon up 
thirty-six crimes, to which they pretend j 



this punishment is due. The rabbins 
reckon three kinds of excision ; one, 
which destroys only the body ; another, 
Avhich destroys the soul only ; and a 
third which destroys both body and soul. 
The first kind of excision they pretend 
is untimely death ; the second is an ut- 
ter extingtion of the soul ; and the third 
a compound of the two former: thus 
making the soul mortal or immortal, 
says Selden, according to the degree of 
misbehaviour and wickedness of the 
people. See next article. 

EXCOMMUNICATION, a penal- 
ty, or censure, whereby persons who 
are guilty of any notorious crime or of- 
fence, are separated from the commu- 
nion of the church, and deprived of all 
spiritual advantages. 

Excommunication is founded upon a 
natural right which all societies have of 
excluding cut of their body such as vio- 
late the laws thereof, and it was origi- 
nally instituted for preserving the puri- 
ty of the church ; but ambitious eccle- 
siastics converted it by degrees into an 
engine for promoting their own power, 
and inflicted it on the most fn\olous oc- 
casions. 

In the ancient church, the power of 
excommunication was lodged in the 
hands of the clergy, who distinguished 
it into the greater and less. The less 
consisted in excluding persons from the 
participation of the eucharist, and the 
pra}ers of the faithful ; but they were 
not expelled the church. The greater 
excommunication consisted in absolute 
and entire seclusion from the churcli, 
and the participation of all its rights: 
notice of which was given by circular 
letters to the most eminent churches all 
over the world, that they might all con- 
firm this act of discijjline, by refusing to 
admit the delinquent to their commu- 
nion. The consequences were very ter- 
rible. The person so excommunicated, 
was avoided in all civil commerce and 
outward conversation. No one was to 
receive him into his house, nor eat at 
the same table with him ; and, when 
dead, he was denied the solemn rites of 
burial. 

The Jews expelled from their syna- 
gogue such as had committed any griev- 
ous crime. See John ix. 32. John xii. 42. 
John xvi. 2. and Joseph. Antiq. Jud. lib. 
9. cap. 22. and lib. 16. cap. 2. Godwyn, 
in his Moses and Aaron, distingaiishes 
three degi'ees or kinds of excommuni- 
cation among the Jews. The first he 
finds intimated in John ix. 22. the second 
in 1 Cor. v. 5. and the third in 1 Cor. 
xvi. 22. 
The Romish pontifical takes notice of

EXC 



three kinds of excomrnunicaticn. ]. 
The minor, incurred bv those who have 
anv correspondence with an excommu- 
nicated person. — 2. The major, which 
falls upon those who disobey the com- 
mands of the holy see, or refuse to sub- 
mit to certain points of discipline ; in 
consequence of Avhich they are exclu- 
ded from the church militant and trium- 
phant, and delivered ovor to the devil, 
and his ancrels. — 3. Anathema, which is 
properh' that jjronounced by the pope 
against heretical princes and countries. 
In fonner ages, these papal fuimina- 
tions were most terrible things ; but 
latterly they were formidable to none 
but a few petty states of Italy. 

Excommunication, in the Greek 
church, cuts off the offender from all 
communion with the three hundred and 
eighteen fathers of the first council of 
IS ice, and with the saints; consigns him 
over to the devil and the traitor Judas, 
and condemns his body to remain after 
death as hard as a flint or piece of steel, 
unless he humble himself, and make 
atonement for his sins by a sincere re- 

Sentance. The form abounds with 
readful imprecations ; and the Cireeks 
assert, that, if a person dies excom.mu- 
nicated, the devil enters into the lifeless 
corpse ; and, therefore, in order to pre- 
vent it, the relations of the deceased 
cut his body in pieces, and boil them in 
wine. It is a custom with the patriarch 
of Jerusalem annually to excommuni- 
cate the pope and the church of Rome ; 
on which occasion, together with a great 
deal of idle ceremony, he drives a nail 
into the ground with a hammer, as a 
mark of malediction. 

The form of excommunication in the 
church of England anciently ran thus: 
" By the authority of Ciod the Father 
Almighty, the Son, and Holy Ghost, and 
of iVIary the blessed mother of God, 
we excommunicate, anathematize, and 
sequester from the holy mother church, 
&amp;c." The causes of excommunication 
in England are, contempt of the bishops' 
court, heresy, neglect of public worship 
and the sacraments, incontinency, adul- 
tery, simony, 8cc. It is descrilied to be 
twofold ; the less is an ecclesiastical 
censure, excluding the party from the 
participation of the sacrament; the 
greater proceeds farther, and excludes 
him not only from these, but from the 
company of all christians; but if the 
judge of any spiritual court excommu- 
nicates a man for a cause of which he 
has not the legal cognizance, the party 
ma)^ have an action against him at com- 
mon law, and he is also liable to be in- 
dicted at the suit of the king. 



Excommunication in the church of 
Scotland, consists only in an exclusion 
of openly profane and immoral persons 
from baptism and the Lord's supper; 
but is ■ eldom publicly denounced, as, 
indeed, sucli persons genei-ally exclude 
themselves from the latter orduiance at 
least; but it is attended with no civil 
incapacity whatever. 

Among the Independents and Bap- 
tists, the persons who are or should be 
excommunicated, are such as are quar- 
relsome and litigious, Gal. v. 12. ; such, 
as desert their privileges, withdraw 
themselves from the ordinances of God, 
and forsake his people, Juds 19 ; such 
as are irregular and immoral in their 
liA'-es, railers, dnmkai'ds, extortioners, 
foiTiicators, and covetous, Eph. v. 5. 
1 Cor. V. 11. 

"The exclusion of a person from any 
Christian church does not affect his tem- 
poral e*^^tate and civil affairs; it does not 
subject him to fines or imprisonments ; 
it interferes not with the business of a 
civil magisti-ate ; it makes no change in 
the natural and civil relations between 
husbands and wives, parents and chil- 
dren, masters and servants ; neither 
does it deprive a man of the liberty of 
attending public worship ; it removes 
him, ■ owever, from the communion of 
the church, and the privileges depen- 
dent on it : this is done that he may be 
ashamed of his sin, and be broueht to 
repentance ; that the honour of Christ 
may be vindicated, and that stumbling- 
blocks may he removed out of the Avay." 

Though the act of exclusion be not 
performed exactly in the same manner 
in every church, jet (according to the 
congregational plan) the power of ex- 
cision lies in the church itself. The of- 
ficers take the sense of the members 
assembled together ; and after the mat- 
ter has been properly investigated, and 
all necessary steps taken to reclaim the 
offender, the church proceeds to the 
actual exclusion of the person from 
among them, by sigTiifying their judg- 
ment or opinion that the person is un- 
worthy of a place m God's house. In the 
conclusion of this article, however, we 
must add, that too great caution cannot 
be observed in procedui'es of this kind ; 
every thing should be done with the 
greatest meekness, deliberation, prayer, 
and a deep sense of our own unworthi- 
ness ; with a compassion for the offen- 
der, and a fixed design of embracing 
every opportunity of doing him good, by 
reproving, instructing, and, it possible, 
restoring him to the enjoyment of the 
privileges he has forfeited by his con 
duct. See Church. 



EXH 



176 



EXi 



EXCUSATI, a term formerly used 
to denote slaves, who, flying to any 
church for sanctuary, were excused 
and pardoned by their masters. 

EXHORTATION, the act of laying 
such motives before a person as may 
excite him to the. performance of any 
duty. It differs only from suasion in that 
the latter principally endeavours to con- 
vince the \inderstanding, and the former 
to work on the affections. It is consi- 
dered as a great branch of preaching, 
though not confined to that, as a man 
may exhort, though he do not preacli ; 
though a man can liardly be said to 

E reach if he do not exhort. It seems, 
owever, that there are some, who, be- 
lieving the inability of man to do any 
thing good, cannot reconcile the idea of 
exhorting men to duty, being, as they 
suppose, a contradiction to address men 
who have no power to act of them- 
selves. But they forget, 1. That the 
Great Author of our being has appoint- 
ed this as a mean for inclining the will 
to himself. Is. Iv. 6, 7. Luke xiv. 17, 23. 
— 2. That they who thus address do not 
suppose that there is any virtue in the 
exhortation itself, but that its energy 
depends on God alone, 1 Cor. xv. 10. — 
3. That the Scripture enjoins ministers 
to exhort men, that is, to rouse them to 
duty, by proposing suitable motives. Is. 
Iviii. 1. 1 Tim. vi. 2. Heb. iii. 13. Rom. 
xii. 8. — 4. That it was the constant prac- 
tice of prophets, apostles, and Christ 
himself, Is. i. 17. Jer. iv. 14. Ez. xxxvii. 
Luke xiii. 3. Luke iii. 18. Acts xi. 23. 
" The express words," says a good di- 
^■ine, " of scriptural in\'itations, exhor- 
tations, and promises, prove more effec- 
tual to encourage those who are ready 
to give up their hopes, than all the con- 
solatory topics that can possibly be sub- 
stitiited in their place. It is, therefore, 
much to be lamented that pious men, 
by adhering to a supposed systematical 
exactness of expression, should clog 
their addresses to sinners with excep- 
tions and limitations, which the Spirit 
of God did not see good to insert. They 
will not say that the omission. was an 
oversight in the inspired writers; or ad- 
mit the thought for a moment, that they 
can improve on their plan : why then 
cannot they be satisfied to 'speak ac- 
cording to the oracles of God, without 
affecting a more entire consistency.'' 
Great mischief has thus been done by 
very different descriptions of men, who 
undesignedly concur in giving Satan an 
occasion of suggesting to the trembling 
enquirer that perhaps he may perse- 
vere in asking, seeking, and knock- 
ing, witli the greatest earnestness and 



importunity, and yet finally be cast 
away." 

EXISTENCE OF GOD. The me- 
thods usually followed in proving the ex- 
istence of God are two ; the first called 
arguiuenturn a priori, which begiiming 
with the cause descends to the effect ; 
the other argume?ituin a Jwsteriori, 
which, from a consideration of the effect, 
ascends to the cause. The former of 
these hath been particularly laboured 
by Dr. Samuel Clarke ; but after all he 
has said, tlie possibility of any one's be- 
ing convinced by it hath been questioned. 
The most general proofs are the follow- 
ing: 1. "AH nations. Heathens, Jews, 
Mahometans, and Christians, harmo- 
niously consent that there is a God who 
created, preserves, and governs all 
things. 1 o this it has been objected, 
that there have been, at different times 
and places, men who were atheists, and 
denicrs of a God. But these have been 
so few, and by their opinions have shown 
that they rather denied the particular 
providence than the existence of God, 
that it can hardly be said to be an ex- 
ception to the argviment stated. And 
e\'en if men were bold enough to assert 
it, it would not be an absolute pi'oof that 
they really believed what they said, 
since it might proceed from a wish that 
there was no God to whom they must 
be accountable for their sin, rather than 
a belief of it, Ps. xiv. 1. It has also been 
objected, that whole nations have been 
found in Africa and America who have 
no notion of a Deity : but this is what 
has never been proved ; on the contrary, 
upon accurate inspection, even the most 
stupid Hottentots, Saldanians, Green- 
landers, Kamtschatkans, and savage 
Americans, are found to have some 
idea of a God. 

2. "It is argued from the law and 
light of Nature, or from the general im- 
pression of Deity on the mind of eveiy 
man, i. e. an indistinct idea of a Being 
of infinite perfection, and a readiness to 
acquiesce in the truth of his existence, 
whenever they understand the terms in 
which it is expressed. Whence could 
this proceed, even in the minds of such 
whose affections and carnal interests 
dispose them to believe the contrary, if 
there were no impression naturally in 
their hearts ? It has been observed by 
some writers, tliat there are no innate 
ideas in the minds of men, and particu- 
larly concerning God ; but this is not 
so easily proved, since an inspired apos- 
tle assures us that even the Gentiles, 
destitute of the law of Moses, have the 
'work of the law written in their 
hearts,' Rom. ii. 15.

S. "The works of creation plainly 
demonstrate the existence of a God. 
The innumerable alterations and mani- 
fest dependence every where observa- 
ble in the world, prove that the things 
which exist in it neither are nor could 
be from eternity. It is self-evident that 
they never could form themselves out 
of nothmg, or in any of their respective 
forms ; and that chance, being nothing 
but the want of design, never did nor 
could form or put into order any thing ; 
far less such a marvellous and well con- 
nected system as our world is. Though 
we should absurdly fancy matter to \iQ 
eternal, yet it could not change its own 
form, or produce life or reason. More- 
over, when we consider the diversified 
and wonderful forms of creatures in the 
world, and how exactly those forms and 
stations con'espond with their respec- 
tive ends and uses ; when we consider 
the marvellous and exact machinery, 
form, and motions of our own bodies ; 
and especially when we consider the 
powers of our soul, its desires after an 
infinite good, and its close union with, 
and incomprehensible operations on our 
bodies, we are obliged to admit a Crea- 
tor of infinite wisdom, power, and good- 
ness. 

4. "It is argued from the support 
and government of the world. Wlio 
can consider the motions of the heaven- 
ly luminaries, exactly calculated for the 
greatest advantage to our earth, and 
its inhabitants ; the exact balancing and 
regulating of the meteors, winds, rain, 
snow, hail, vapour, thunder, and the 
like ; the regular and never-failing re- 
turn of summer and winter, seed-time 
and harvest, day and night ; the aston- 
ishing and diversified formation of vege- 
tables ; the propagation of herbs, almost 
every where, that are most effectual to 
heal the distempers of animal bodies in 
that place ; the almost infinite diversi- 
fication of animals and vegetables, and 
their pertinents, that, notwithstanding 
an amazing similarity, not any two are 
exactly alike, but every form, member, 
or even feather or hair of animals, and 
every pile of grass, stalk of corn, herb, 
leaf, tree, berry, or other fmit, hath 
something peculiar to itself: the making 
of animals so sagaciously to prepare 
their lodgings, defend themselves, pro- 
vide for their health, produce and pro- 
tect, and procure food for their young ; 
the direction of fishes and fowls to 
and in such marvellous and long pere- 
grinations at such seasons, and to such 
places, as best correspond with their 
own preservation and the benefit of 
mankind; the stationing of brute ani- 



mals by sea or land, at less or greater 
distances as are most suited to the safety, 
subsistence or comfort of mankind, and 
preventing the increase of prolific ani- 
mals, and making the less fmitful ones, 
which are used, exceedinglv to abound ; 
the so diversifying the countenances, 
voices, and hand-writings of men, as 
best secures and promotes their social 
advantages; the holding of so equal a 
balance between males and females, 
while the number of males, whose lives 
are peculiarly endangered in war, navi- 
gation, &amp;c., are generally gi-eatest ; the 
prolonging of men's lives, when the 
world needed to be peopled, and now 
shortening them when that necessity 
hath ceased to exist; the almost uni- 
versal provision of food, raiment, medi- 
cine, fuel. Sec, answerable to the nature 
of particular places, cold or hot, moist 
01- dry ; the management of human af- 
fairs relative to societies, govemment, 
peace, war, trade. Sec, in a manner 
different from and contrary to the car- 
nal policy of those concerned ; and es- 
pecially the strangely similar but diver- 
sified erection, preservation, and go- 
vemment of the Jewish and Christian 
churches : who, I say, can consider all 
these things, and not acknowledge the 
existence of a wise, merciful, and good 
God, who governs the world, and every 
thing in it .' 

5. "It is proved fi-om the miraculous 
events which have happened in the 
world ; such as the overaowing of the 
earth by a flood; the confusion of 
languages ; the burning of Sodom and 
the cities about by fire from heaven; 
the plagues of Egypt ; the dividing of 
the Red Sea ; raining manna from hea- 
ven, and bringing streams of water from 
flinty rocks ; the stopping of the course 
of the sun, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

6. " His existence no less clearly ap- 
pears from the exact fiilfilment of so 
many and so particularly circumstan- 
tiated predictions, pubhshed long before 
the event took place. It is impossible 
that these predictions, which were so 
exactly fulfilled in their respective pe- 
riods, and of the fulfilment of which 
there are at present thousands of de- 
monstrative and sensible documents in 
the world, could proceed from any but 
an all-seeing and infinitely wise God. 

7. "The existence of God farther 
apjDears fi*om the fearful punishments 
which have been inflicted upon pcrs'^ins, 
and especiallv upon nations, when their 
immoralities became excessive, and that 
by very unexpected means and instra- 
ments ; as in the drowning; of the old 
world ; destiniction of Sodom and Go-

morrah; plagues of Pharaoh and his 
servants ; overthow of Sennacherib and 
his army ; miseries and rain of the 
Canaanites, Jews, Syrians, As&lt;;yrians, 
Chaldeans, Persians, Egyptians, Greeks, 
Romans, Saracens, Tartars, and others. 

8. "Lastly, the existence of God 
may be argued from the terror and 
dread which wound the consciences of 
men, when guilty of crimes which other 
men do not know, or are not able to 
punish or restrain : as in the case of 
Caligula, Nero, and Domitian, the Ro- 
man emperors ; and this while they ear- 
nestly laoour to persuade themsch^es or 
others that there is no God. Hence 
their being afraid of thunder, or to be 
left alone in the dark, &amp;c." 

As to the modus of the Divine ex- 
istence, it would be presumption to at- 
tempt to explain. That he exists, is 
clear from the foregoing arguments; 
but the manner of that existence is not 
for us to know. Many good men have 
uttered great absurdities in endeavour- 
ing to explain it, and after all none of 
them have succeeded. The wisest of 
men never made the attempt. Moses 
began his writings by supposing the 
being of a God; he did not attempt to 
explain it. Although many of the in- 
spu-ed wi-iters asserted his existence, 
and, to discountenance idolatry, pleaded 
for his perfections, yet no one of them 
ever pretended to explain the manner 
of his being. Our duty is clear. We 
are not commanded nor expected to 
understand it. All that is required is 
this : " He that cometh to God must be- 
lieve that he is, and that he is a reward- 
er of them that diligently seek him."

EXORCISM, the expelling of devils 
from persons possessed, by means of 
conjuration and prayers. The Jews 
made great pretences to tliis power. 
Josephus tells several Avonderful tales 
of the great success of se^'eral exor- 
cists. One Eleazer, a Jew, cured many 
djemoniacs, he saysj by means of a rovot 
set in a ring. This root, witli the ring, 
■was held under the patient's nose, and 
the devil was forthwith evacuated. The 
most part of conjurers of this class v/ere 
impostors, each pretending to a secret 
nostrum or charm which was an over- 
match for the devil. Our Saviour com- 
municated to his disciples a real power j 



over dxmons, or at least over the dis- 
eases said to be occasioned by dxmons. 
See DyEJioNiAC. 

Exorcism makes a considerable part 
of tlie superstition of the church of 
Rome, the ritual of which forbids the 
exorcising any person without the bi- 
shop's leave. The ceremony is per- 
formed at the lower end of the church, 
towards the door. The exorcist first 
signs the possessed person with the sign 
of the cross, makes him kneel, and 
sprinkles him with lioly water. Then 
follow the litanies, psalms, and prayer; 
after which the exorcist asks the devil 
his name, and adjures him by the mys- 
teries of the Christian religion not to af- 
flict the person any more; then, laying 
his right hand on the dscmoniac's head, 
he repeats tlie form of exorcism, which 
is this : " I exorcise thee, unclean spi- 
rit, in the name of Jesus Christ : trem- 
ble, O Satan, thou enemj' of the faith, 
thou foe of mankind, who hast brought 
death into the world ; who hast de- 
prived men of life, and hast rebelled 
against justice ; thou seducer of man- 
kind, thou root of all evil, thou source 
of avai'ice, discord, and envy." The 
Romanists likewise exorcise houses and 
other places supposed to be haunted by 
unclean spirits ; and the ceremony is 
much the same with that for a person 
por-sessed.

EXPEDIENCY, the fitness or pi-o-

EXPERIEN CE, knowledge acquired 
l)y long use without a teacher. It con- 
sists in the ideas of things we have seen 
or read, which the judgment has re- 
flected on, to form for itself a rule or 
method. 

Christian experience is that religious 
knowledge which is acquh-ed by any 
exercises, enjoyments, or sufferings, 
either of body or mind. Nothing is more 
common than to ridicule and despise 
what is called religious experience as 
mere enthusiasm. But if religion con- 
sist in feeling, we would ask, how it can 
possibly exist without experience ? We 
are convinced of, and admit the pro- 
priety of the term, when applied to 
those branches of science which are not 
fouiided on speculation or conjecture, 
but on sensible trial. Why, then, should 
it be rejected when applied to religion ? 
It is evident that, however beautiful re- 
ligion may be in name, its excellency 
and energy ai-e only truly known and 
displayed as exfierienced. A system 
believed, or a mind merely informed, 
\ will produce little good, except the

heart be affected, and we feel its influ- 
ence. To expei"ience, then, the veH- 
gion of Christ, we must not only be ac- 
quainted with its tiieory, but enjoy its 
power; subduing our corruptions, ani- 
mating our aftections, and exciting us to 
duty. Hei\ce the Scripture culls expe- 
rience tasting; Ps. xxxiv. 8. fee/i?ig, ike. 
1 Thes. ii. 13, &amp;c. That' our expe- 
rience is always absolutely pure in the 
E resent state cannot be expected. "The 
est experience," says a good writer, 
"may be mixed with natural affections 
and passions, impressions on the ima- 
gination, self-righteousness, or spiritual 
pride ;" but this is no reason that all 
experience is to be rejected, for upon 
this ground nothing could be received, 
since nothing is absolutely perfect. It 
is, however, to be lamented, that v/liile 
the best of men have a mixture in their 
experience, there are otliers whose ex- 
perience (so called) is entirely counter- 
feit. They have been alarmed, have 
changed the ground of their confidence, 
have had tlieir imaginations heated and 
delighted by impressions and visionary 
representations; they have recollected 
the promises of the Gospel, as if spoken 
to them with peculiar appropriation, to 
certify them that their sins were for- 
given ; and i\aviug seen and heard such 
wonderful things, they think they must 
doubt no more of their adoption into the 
family of God. They have also fre- 
quently heard all experience profanely 
ridiculed as enthusiasm ; and this be- 
trays tliem into the opposite extreme, 
so that they are emboldened to despise 
every caution as tlie result of enmity to 
internal religion, and to act as if there 
were no delusive or counterfeit expe- 
i-ience. But tlie event too plainly shows 
their awful mistake, and that they 
grounded their expectations upon the 
account given of the extraordinary ope- 
rations of the Holy Spirit on tlie mind 
of prophets, rather than on the promises 
of his renewing influences in the hearts 
of believers. vVhen, therefore, they 
lose the impressions with which they 
once were elated, they relapse nearly 
into their old course of life, their creed 
and confidence alone excepted." 

Christian experience may be consi- 
dered as genuine, 1. \^^hen it accords 
■with the revelation of God's mind and 
will, or what he has revealed in his 
"word. Any thing contrary to this, 
however pleasing, cannot be sound, or 
produced by divine agency. — 2. When 
Its tendency is to promote humility in 
us : that experience, by which we learn 
our own weakness, and subdues pride, 
must be good. — 3. When it teaches us 



to bear with others, and to do them 
good. — 4. When it operates so as to ex- 
cite us to be ardent in our devotion, and 
sincere in our regard to God. A power- 
ful experience ot the divine favour will 
lead us to acknowledge the same, and 
to manifest our gratitude both by con- 
stant praise and genuine piety. 

Christian experience, however, may 
be abused. There are some good peo- 
ple who certainly have felt and enjoyed 
the power of religion, and yet have not 
always acted with prudence as to theii- 
experience. 1. Some boast of their ex- 
periences, or talk of tliem as if tliey 
were very extraordinar)- ; whereas, 
were they acquainted witli others, tliey 
would find it not so. That a man may 
make mention of his experience, is no 
way improper, but often useful ; but to 
hear persons always talking of them- 
selves, seem.s to indicate a spirit of pride, 
and that their experience cannot be very 
deep. — 2. Another abuse of experience 
is, dependence on it. We ought cer- 
tainly to take encouragement from past 
circumstances, if we can ; but if we are 
so dependent on past experience as to 
preclude present exertions, or always 
expect to have exactly the same as- 
sistance in every state, trial, or oi'di- 
nance, we shall be disappointed. God 
has wisely ordered it, that though he 
never will leave his people, yet he will 
suspend or bestow comfort in his own 
time ; for this very i-eason, that we may 
rely on him, and not on the circumstance 
or oi'dinance. — 3. It is an abuse of ex- 
perience, when introduced at impropei- 
times, and before improper persons. It 
is true, we ought never to be ashamed 
of our profession ; but to be always talk- 
.ing to irreligious people respecting ex- 
perience, which they know nothing of, 
is, as our Saviour says, casting pearls 
before swine. Bunyan's Pil^rim^s Pro- 
gress ; Buck's Treatise on Exfierience ;

EXPERIENCE MEETINGS, are 
assemblies of religious persons, who 
meet for the purpose of relating their 
experience to each otlier. It has been 
doubted by some whether these meetings 
are of any great utility ; and wliether 
they do not in some measure force peo- 
ple to say more than is true, and puff 
up those with pride who are able to 
communicate their ideas with facility ; 
but to this it may be answered, 1. That 
the abuse of a thing is no proof of the 
evil of it. — 2. That the most eminent

saints of old did not neglect this practice, 
Ps. Ixvi. 16. Mai. iii. 16.-3. That by a 
wise and prudent relation of experience, 
the Christian is led to see that others 
have participated of the same joys and 
sorrows with himself; he is excited to 
lo\^e and sen'e God; and animated to 
perseverance in duty, by finding that 
others, of like passions with himself, 
are zealous, active, and diligent. — 4. 
That the Scriptures seem to enjoin the 
frequent intercourse of Christians for 
the purpose of strengthening each other

F. 



FAITH is that assent which we give 
to a proposition advanced by another, 
the truth of Avhich we do not imme- 
diately perceive from our own reason 
and experience ; or it is a judgment or 
assent of the mind, the motive whereof 
is not any intrinsic evidence, but the 
authority or testimony of some otlier 
who reveals or relates it. The Greek 
word riio-ris, translated faith, comes 
from the verb ITfiOu, to persuade ; the 
nature of faith being a persuasion and 
assent of the mind, arising from testi- 
mony or evidence. 

1. Dmine faith, is that founded on the 
authority of God, or it is that assent 
which we give to what is revealed by 
God. The objects of this, therefore,' 
are matters of revelation. 

2. Human faith, is that whereby we 
believe what is told us by men. The 
objects hereof are matters of human 
testimony or evidence. 

3. Historical faith, is that whereby 
we assent to the tniths ot revelation as 
a kind of certain and infallible record, 
James ii. 17, or to any fact recorded in 
history. 

4. The faith of miracles, is the per- 
suasion a person has of his being able, 
by the divine power, to effect a miracle 
on another, Matt. xvii. 20. 1 Cor. xiii. 2. 
or another on himself. Acts xiv. 9. This 
obtained chiefly in the time of Christ 
and his apostles. 

5. A temporary faith, is an assent to 
evangelical tiniths, as both interesting 
and desirable, but not farther than they 
ai'e accompanied with temporal ai^•an- 
t^ges J and which is lost when such ad- j 



vantages diminish or are removed. Matt, 
xi. 24. Luke viii. 13. 

6. Faith in respect to futurity, is a 
moral principle, implying such a con- 
viction of the reality and importance of 
a future state, as is sufficient to regu- 
late the temper and conduct. 

7. Faith in Christ, or saving faith, is 
that principle wrought in the heart by 
the Divine Spirit, wherebv we are per- 
suaded that Christ is the Messiah ; and 
possess such a desire and expectation of 
the blessings he has promised in his 
Gospel, as engages the mind to fix its 
dependence on him, and subject itself to 
him in all the ways of holy obedience, 
and relying solely on his grace for ever- 
lasting life. These are the ideas which 
are generally annexed to the definition 
of saving faith ; but, accurately speak- 
ing, faith is an act of the understanding, 
giving credit to the testimony of the 
Gospel ; and desire, expectation, confi- 
dence, &amp;c. are rather the effects of it, 
than faith itself, though inseparably con- 
nected with it. Much has been said as 
to the order or place in which faith 
stands in the Christian system, some 
placing it before, others after repent- 
ance. Perhaps the following remarks 
on the subject may be considered as 
consistent with truth and Scripture : 1. 
Regeneration is the work of God en- 
lightening the mind, and changing the 
heart, and in order of time precedes 
faith. — 2. Faith is the consequence of 
regeneration, and implies the percep- 
tion of an object. It discerns the evil of 
sin, the holiness of God, gives credence 
to the testimony of God in his word, aad 



FAl

seems to precede repentance, since we 
cannot repent of that of which we have 
no clear perception, or no concern 
about. — 3. Repentance is an after- 
thought, or sori'owing for sin, the evil 
nature of which faith perceives, and 
which immediately follows faith. — 4. 
Conversion is a turning from sin, which 
faith sees, and repentance sorrows for, 
and seems to follow, and to be the end 
of all the rest. 

As to the profierties or adjuncts of 
faith, we may obsel■^'e, 1. That it is the 
nrst and principal grace : it stands first 
in order, and takes the precedence of 
other graces, Mark xvi. 16. Heb. xi. 
6. — 2. It is every way precious and 
valuable, 1 Pet. ii. 1. — 3. It is called in 
Scripture, one faith ; for though there 
are several sorts of faith, there is but 
one special or saving faith, Eph. iv. 5. 
— 4. It is also denominated common 
faith ; common to all the regenerate, 
Tit. i. 4. — 5. It is tnie, reai, and un- 
feigned. Acts viii. 37. Rom. x. 10. — 

6. It cannot be finally lost as to the 
grace of it, Phil. i. 6. 1[..uke xxii. 32. — 

7. It is progressive, Luke xvii. 5. 2 
Thess. i. 3. — 8. It appropriates and 
realizes, or, as the apostle says, is the 
substance of things hoped foi-, and the 
evidence of things not seen, Heb. xi. 1. 

The evidence or effects of faith, are, 
1. Love to Christ, 1 Pet. i. 8. Gal. v. 6. 
— 2. Confidence, Eph. iii. 12. — 3. Joy, 
Rom. V. 11. Phil. i. 25. — i. Prayer, 
Heb. iv. 16. — 5. Attention to his ordi- 
nances, and profit by them, Heb. iv. 2. 
— 6. Zeal in the promotion of his gloiy, 
1 Coi-. XV. 58. Gal. vi. 9.-7. Holiness 
of heart and life. Matt. vii. 20. 1 John 
ii. 3. Acts XV. 9. James ii. 18, 20, 22.

FAITHFULNESS OF GOD, is that 
perfection of his nature whereby he in- 
iMlibly fulfils his designs, or perfovms 



his word. It appears, says Dr. Gill, in 
the performance of what he has said 
with i-espect to the world in general, 
that it shall not be destroyed by a flood, 
as it once was, and for a token of it, has 
set his bow in the clouds ; that the or- 
dinances of heaven should keep their 
due course, which they have done for 
almost 6000 years exactly and punctu- 
ally ; that all his creatures should be 
supported and provided for, and the 
elements all made subservient to that 
end, which we find do so according to 
his sovereign pleasure. Gen. ix. Isa. 
liv. 9. Ps. clxv. Deut. xi. 14, 15. 2 
Pet. iii. 

2. It appears in the fulfilment of what 
he has said with respect to Christ. 
Whoever will take the pains to com- 
pare the predictions of the birth, pover- 
ty, life, sufferings, death, resurrection, 
and ascension of Christ, with the ac- 
complishment of the same, will find a 
striking demonstration of the faithful- 
ness of God. 

3. It appears in the performance of 
the promises which he has made to his 
people. In respect to temporal bless- 
ings, 1 Tim. iv. 8. Psal. Ixxxiv. 11. Is, 
xxxiii. 16. — 2. To spiritual, 1 Cor. i. 9. 
In supporting them in temptation, 
1 Cormth. x. 13. Encouraging them 
under persecution, 1 Pet. iv. 12, 13. 
Isa. xli. 10. Sanctifying afflictions, Heb. 
xii. 4 to 12.' Directing them in difficul- 
ties, 1 Thess. v. 24. Enabling them to 
persevere, Jer. xxxi. 40. Bringing 
them to glory, 1 John ii. 25. 

4. It appears in the fulfilling of his 
threatenings. The curse came upon 
Adam according as it was threatened.^ 
He fulfilled his threatening to the old 
world in destroying it. He declared 
that the Israelites should be subject to 
his awful displeasure, if they walked 
not in his ways; it was accordingly ful- 
filled, Deut. xxviii. See Immutabili- 
ty. 

FALL OF MAN, the loss of those 
perfections and that happiness which 
his Maker bestowed on him at his crea- 
tion, through transgression of a positive 
command, given for the trial of man's 
obedience, and as a token of his holding 
eveiy thing of God, as lord paramount 
of the creation, with the use of every 
thing in it, exclusive of the fniit of one 
tree. This positive law he broke by 
eating the forbidden fruit ; first the wo- 
man, then the man : and thus the con- 
dition or law of the covenant being bro- 
ken, the covenant itself was broken. 
The woman was enticed bv an evil ge-

man into the transgi-ession of the law, 
of which a brute beast is incapable. 
Hence the evil genius is called a mur- 
derer and a liar from the beginning, 
John viii. 44. Rom. v. 12, the old ser- 
pent, Rev. xii. 9. xx. 2. Moses relates 
this histoiy, from what appeared ex- 
ternally to sense; both, therefore, are 
to be conjoined, the serpent as the in- 
strument, and the devil as the primaiy 
cause. Man suffered himself to be se- 
duced by perverse and confused notions 
of good and evil, prompted by a desire 
of a greater degi-ee of perfection, and 
swayed by his sensual sippetite, in con- 
tradiction to his reason, Gen. iii. 6. And 
thus it appears possible, how, notwith- 
standing the divine image with which 
man is adorned, lie might fall; for, 
though included in it knowledge, it did 
not exclude fi'om it confused notions, 
which are those arising from sense and 
imagination, especially when off our 
guard and inattentive, blindly following 
the present impression. From this one 
sin arose another, and then another, 
from the connection of causes and ef- 
fects, till this repetition brought on a 
habit of sin, consequently a state of 
moral slavery ; called by divines a deatli 
in sin, a spiritual deatli, a defect of pow- 
er to act according to the law, and from 
the motive of the divine perfections, as 
death in general is such a defect of 

Eower of action ; and this defect or ina- 
ility, with all its consequences, man 
entailed on his posterity, remaining upon 
them, till 07ie greater man remove this, 
and reinstate them in all they forfeited 
in Adam. 

In the fall of man we may observe, 1. 
The greatest infidelity. — 2. Prodigious 
pride. — 3. Horrid ingratitude. — 4. Visi- 
ble contempt of God's majesty and jus- 
tice. — 5. Unaccountable folly. — 6. A 
ci-uelty to himself and to all his posteri- 
ty. Infidels, however, have treated the 
account of the fall and its effects, with 
contempt, and considered the whole as 
absurd ; but their objections to the man- 
ner have been ably answered by a va- 
riety of authors; and as to the effects, 
one would hardly think any body could 
deny. For, that man is a fallen crea- 
ture, is evident, if we consider his mise- 
ry as an inhabitant of the natural world ; 
the disorders of the globe we inhabit, 
and the dreadful scourges with which it 
is visited ; the deplorable and shocking 
circumstances of our birth ; the painful 
and dangerous travail of women ; our 
natural uncleanliness, helplessness, igno- 
rance, and nakedness ; the gross dark- 
ness in which we naturdUy are, both 
with respect to God and a future state ; 



the general rebellion of the brute crea- 
tion against us ; the various poisons that 
lurk m the animal, vegetable, and mi- 
neral world, ready to destroy us : the 
heavy curse of toil and sweat to which 
we are liable ; the innumerable calami- 
ties of life, and the pangs of death. 
Again, it is evident, if we consider him 
as a citizen of the moral world ; his 
commission of sin ; his omission of duty ; 
the triumph of sensual appetites over 
his intellectual faculties; the coiruption 
of the powers that constitute a good 
head, the understanding, imagination, 
memory, and reason ; the depravity of 
the poivers which form a good heart, 
the Avill, conscience, and affections ; his 
manifest alienation from God ; his ama- 
zing disregard even of his nearest re- 
latives ; his unaccountable unconcern 
about himself; his detestable tempers; 
the general out-breaking of human cor- 
ruption in all individuals ; the universal 
overflowing of it in all nations. Some 
striking proofs of this depravity may be 
seen in the general propensity of man- 
kind to vain, irrational, or cruel diver- 
sions ; in the universality of the most ri- 
diculous, impious, inhuman, and diaboli- 
cal sins ; in the aggravating circumstan- 
ces attending the displav of this cor- 
ruption ; in the many ineffectual endea- 
vours to stem its torrent, in the obstinate 
resistance it makes to divine grace in 
the unconverted ; the amazing struggles 
of good men with it; the testimony of 
the heathens concerning it ; and the 
preposterous conceit which the uncon- 
verted have of their own goodness.

FAMILIARS OF THE INQUISI- 
TION, persons who assist in appre- 
hending such as are accused, and carry- 
ing them to prison. They are assistants 
to the inquisitor, and called familiars, 
because they belong to his family. In 
some provinces of Italy they are called 
cross bearers; and in others the scho- 
lars of St. Peter the martyr; and wear 
a cross befoi-e them on the outside gar- 
ment. They are properlv bailiffs of the 
inquisition : and the vile office is esteem- 
ed so honourable, that noblemen in the 
kingdom of Portugal have been aml)i- 
tious of belonging to it. Nor is this sur- 
prising, when it is considered that Int- 
nocent III. gi-anted very large indulgen-

cics and privileges to these familiars; 
and that tne same plenary indulgence is 
granted by the pope to every single ex- 
ercise of this office, as was granted by 
the Latcran council to those who suc- 
coured the Holy Land. When several 
pciTjons are to be taken up at the same 
time, these familiars are commanded to 
order matters that they may know no- 
thing of one another's being apprehend- 
ed ; and it is related, that a father and 
his three sons and three daughters, who 
lived together in the same house, were 
carried prisoners to the inquisition 
without knowing any thing of one 
another's being there till seven years 
afterwards, when they that were alive 
were released bj' an act of faith. See

FANATICS, wild enthusiasts, vi- 
sionary persons, who pretend to revela- 
tion and inspiration. The ancients call- 
ed those fanatici who passed their 
times in temples {fana-) and being 
often seized with a kind of enthusiasm, 
as if inspired by the Divinity, showed 
wild and antic gestures, cutting and 
slashing their arms with knives, sha- 
king the head, &amp;c. Hence the word was 
applied among us to the Anabaptists, 
Quakers, &amp;c. at their first rise, and is 
now an epithet giv-en to modern pro- 
phets, enthusiasts, &amp;c. ; and we believe 
unjustly to those who possess a consi- 
derable degree of zeal and fervency of 
devotion. 

FARNOVIANS, a sect of Socinians, 
so called from Stanislaus Farnovius, 
who separated from the other Unita- 
rians in the year 1568. He asserted 
that Christ had been engendered or 
produced out of nothing by the Supreme 
Being, before the creation of this terres- 
trial globe, and warned his disciples 
against paying religious worship to the 
Divine Spirit. This sect did not last 
long ; for having lost their chief, who 
died in 1615, it was scattered, and re- 
duced to nothing. 

FASTING, abstinence from food, 
more particularly that abstinence which 
is used on a religious account. 

The Jews had every year a stated and 
solem.n fast on the ioth day of the 
month Tisri, which generally answered 
to the close of our September. This 
solemnity was a day ot strict rest and 
fasting to the Israelites. Many of them 
spent the day before in prayer, and 
such like penitential exercises. On the 
day itself, at least in later times, they 
made a tenfold confession of their sins, 



and were careful to end all their mutual 
broils. See Lev. xvi. Numb. xxix. 7, 
]2. Lev. xxiii. 23, 32. Individuals also 
fasted on any extraordinary distress. 
Thus David fasted during the sickness 
of his adulterous child, 2 Sam. xii. 21. 
Ahali, when he was threatened with 
ruin, 1 Kings xii. 27. Daniel, when he 
understood that the Jewish captivity 
drew to an end, 9th and 10th chapters 
of Nehemiah, Joshua, 8cc. 

However light some think of reli- 
gious fasting, it seems it has been prac- 
tised by most nations from the remotest 
antiquity. The Egyptians, Phoenicians, 
and Assyrians, had their fasts as well 
as the Jews. Porphyry affirms that the 
Egyptians, before their stated sacinfi- 
ces, always fasted a great many days j 
sometimes for six weeks. The Greeks 
observed their fasts much in the same 
manner. At Rome, kings and empe- 
rors fasted themselves. Numa Pompi- 
lius, Julius Csesai", Augustus, Vespasian, 
and others, we are told, had their sta- 
ted fast days ; and Julian the apostate 
was so exact in this observation, that 
he outdid the priests themselves. The 
Pythagoreans frequently fasted rigidly 
for a long time ; and Pythagoras, their 
master, continued his fast, it is said, for 
forty days together. The Brachmans, 
and the Chinese, have also their stated 
fasts. 

Eveiy one knows how much fasting 
has been considered as an important 
rite in the church of Rome, and the ex- 
tremes they have run into in this re- 
spect. See article Abstinence. The 
church of England also has particular 
seasons for fasting, especially that of 
Lent, which is to be observed as a time 
of humiliation before Easter, the gene- 
ral festival of our Saviour's resurrection. 
Fast da)^s are also appointed by the 
legislature upon any extraordinary oc- 
casions of calamity, wai", &amp;c. See art. 
Rogation, Lent. 

Religious fasting consists, 1. "In ab- 
stinence from every animal indulgence, 
and from food, as far as health and cir- 
cumstances will admit. — 2. In the hum- 
ble confession of our sins to God, with 
contrition or sorrow for them. — 3. An 
earnest deprecation of God's displea- 
sure, and humble supplication that he 
would avert his judgments. — 4. An in- 
tercession with God for such spiritual 
and temporal blessings upon ourselves 
and others which are needful." It does 
not appear that our Saviour instituted 
any particular fast, but left it optional. 
Any state of calamity and sorrow, how- 
ever, naturally suggests this. The 
firopriety of it may appear, 1, From

many examples recorded in Scripture. 
— 2. By plain and undeniable inferences 
from Scripture, Matt. vi. 16. — 3. F\om 
divine commands given on sonie occa- 
sions, though there are no commands 
which prescribe it as a constant duty. — 
4. It may be argued from its utility.

natural expression of our sorrow. — 2. A 
help to devotional exercises. — 3. Keep- 
ing the body in subjection. — i. Mav be 
rendered svibservient to charity. How 
far or how long a person should abstain 
from food, depends on circumstances. 
The great end to be kept in view is, 
humiliation for, and abstinence from 
sin. "If," says Marshall, "abstinence 
divert our minds, by i-eason of a gnaw- 
ing appetite, then you had better eat 
sparingly, as Daniel in his greatest 
fast," Dan. x. 2, 3. They, however, 
who in times of public distress, when 
the judgments of God are in the earth, 
and when his providence seems to call 
for humiliation, will not relinquish any 
of their sensual enjoyments, nor deny 
themselves in the least, cannot be justi- 
fied ; since good men in all ages, more 
or less, have humbled themselves on 
such occasions; and reason as well as 
Scripture evidently prove it to be our 
duty. Matt. ix. 15. 1 Cor. vii. 5. Ben-

FATE {fatum^ denotes an inevitable 
necessity dependmg upon a superior 
cause. The word is formed a fando, 
"from speaking," and primarily implies 
the same with f^?u7», viz. a word or 
decree pronounced by God, or a fixed 
sentence whereby the Deity has pre- 
scribed the order of things, and allotted 
to every person what shall befal him. 
The Greeks called it fifiaj'tifvr,, as it 
were a chain or necessary series of 
things indissolubly linked together. It 
is also used to express a certain una- 
voidable designation of things, by which 
all agents, both necessary and volun-l 
tar)', are swayed and directed to their I 
ends. Fate is divided into physical and 
divine. 1. Physical fate is an order and 
series of natural causes, appropriated 
to their effects; as, that ftre wai-ms; 
bodies communicate motion to each 
other, 8cc." and the effects of it are all 
the events and phenomena of nature. — 
2. Divine fate is what is more usuallv 
called providence. See Providence, 
Necessity. 

FATHERS, a term applied to an- 
cient authors who have preserved in 
their writings traditions of^ the church. 



Thus St. Chrysostom, St. Basil, &amp;c. are 
called Greek fathers, and St. Augustine 
and St. Ambrose, Latin fathers. No 
author who wrote later than the twelfth 
century is dignified with the title of 
father. 

Some suppose that the study of the 
fathers is barren and unimproving ; that 
though there are some excellent things 
interspersed in their writings, yet the 
instruction to be derived from them 
will hardly repay the toil of breaking 
up the gi'ound ; that a life-time would 
hardly suffice to read them with care, 
and digest them completely. Others 
have such an high opinion of the fathers, 
as to be almost afraid of inteipreting 
Scripture against their decision. They 
suppose, that as some of them were 
companions, disciples, or successively 
followers of the apostles, it is highly 
probable that they must have been well 
informed, that their sentiments must be 
strongly illustrative of the doctrines of 
the New Testament ; and that as con- 
troversies have increased, and dogmas 
received since their time, they must be 
much less entangled with decisions 
merely human than more recent com- 
mentators. Perhaps it is best to steer 
between these two opinions. If a person 
have ability, inclination, and opportu- 
nity to wade through them, let him : 
but if not, referring to them occasionally 
may suffice. One caution, however, is 
necessary, which is this; that though 
the judgment of antiquity in some dis- 
putable points certainly may be useful, 
yet we ought never to put them on the 
same footing as the Scriptures. In 
many cases they may be considered as 
competent witnesses ; but we must not 
confide in their verdict as judges. Jor-

FAULT, a slight defect or crime 
which subjects a person to blame, but 
not to punishment ; a deviation from, or 
transgression of a rule in some trifling 
circumstance. 

FAVOUR OF GOD. See Grace. 

FEAR is that uneasiness of mind 
which arises from an apprehension of 
danger, attended with a desire of avoid- 
ing it. " Fear," says Dr. Watts, " shows 
itself by paleness of the cheeks, sinking 
of the spirits, trembling of the limbs, 
hurry and confusion of the mind and 
thoughts, agonies of nature, and faint-

in^. Many a person has died with fear. 
Sometimes it rouses all nature to exert 
itself in speedy flight, or other methods 
to avoid the approaching evil : sudden 
terror has performed some almost in- 
credibles of this kind." 

Fear is of ditfcrent kinds: 1. There 
is an idolatrous and su/ierstitious fear. 
which is called Ssic-i^ai^cvia, a fear of 
dxmons, which the city of Athens was 
greatly addicted to. "I perceive," says 
the apostle Paul, " that in all things ye 
are too superstitious," or given to the 
fear and worship of false deities. — 2. 
There is an external fear of God, an 
outward show and profession of it, 
which is taught by the precepts of men : 
as in the men of Samaria, who pre- 
tended to fear the Lord, as the priest 
instinicted them, and yet served their 
own gods; and such an extern?d fear 
of God, Job's friends supposed was all 
that he had, and that even he had cast 
that off. — 3. There is an Injfiocritical 
fear, v/hen men make a profession of 
religion ; but only se!-\c him for some 
sinister end and selfish view, which 
Satan insinuated was Jc/a's case. "Doth 
Job fear God for nought ?" Job i. 9. — 
4. There is a servile fear, v/hich they 
possess who ser\'e God from fear of 
punishment, and not from love to him. 
— 5. There is a filial fear, such as that 
of a son to his father. Fear is sinful 
when — 1. It proceeds from unbelief or 
distitist of God : 2. When it ascribes 
more to the creature than is due ; or 
when we fear oiu" enemies without con- 
sidering they are under God : 3. When 
we fear that in God that is not in him, 
or that he will break his promise, &amp;c. 4. 
When our fear is immoderate, so as to 
distract us in duty. See next article. 

FEAR OF GOD, is that holy dispo- 
sition or gracious habit formed in the 
soul by the Holy Spirit, whereby we 
are inclined to obey all God's com- 
mands ; and evidences itself, 1. By a 
dread of his displeasure. — 2. Desire of 
his favour. — 3. Regard for his excel- 
lencies. — 4. Submission to his will. — 5. 
Gratitude for his benefits. — 6. Sincerity 
in his worship. — 7. Conscientious obe- 
dience to his commands, Prov. viii. 13.

FEAST, in a religious sense is a cere- 
monv of feasting and thanksgiving. 

The principal feasts of the Jews were 
the feasts of trumpets, of expiation, of 
tabernacles, of the dedication, of the 
passcn er, of Pentecost, and that of pu- 



rification. Feasts, and the cereiTiol\ie«i 
thereof, have made great part of the 
religion of almost all nations and sects ; 
hence the Greeks, the Romans, Maho- 
metans, and Christians, have not been 
without them. 

Feasts, among us, are either immove- 
able or moveable. Immoveable leasts 
are those constantly celebrated on the 
same day of the yeai'. Theprir.cipal of 
these are Christriias-day, Circumcision, 
Epiphany, Candlemas or Purification ; - 
Lady-day, or the annunciation, callecl 
also the incarnation and conception ; 
All Saints and All Souls; besides the 
days of the several apostles, as St. 
Thomas, St. Paul. Moveable feasts are 
those Vv'hich are not confined to the 
same day of the year. Of these the 
principal is Easter, which gives law 
to all the I'est, all of them following and 
keeping their pi'oper distances from it. 
Such are Palm Sunda}', Good Friday, 
Ash Wednesday, Sexagesima, Ascen- 
sion-day, Pentecost, and Trinity Sun- 
day. 

Besides these feasts, which are gene- 
ral, and enjoined by the church, there 
are others local and occasional, enjoined 
by the magistrate, or voluntarily set on 
foot by the people ; such are the days 
of thanksgiving for deliveiy from war, 
plagues, &amp;c. ; such also are the vigils 
or wakes in commemoration of the de- 
dication of particular churches. 

The prodigious increase of feast-days 
in the Christian church, commenced to- 
wards the close of the fourth century, 
occasioned by the discovery that was 
made of the remains of martyrs, and 
other holy men, for the commemoration 
of whom they were established. These, 
instead of being set apart for pious ex- 
ercises, were abused in indolence, vo- 
luptuousness, and criminal practices. 
Many of them were instituted on a pa- 
gan model, and perverted to similar 
pui-poses. See Holy Day. 

FEAST OF ASSES. Thiswasafes- 
tival in the Romish church, and was 
celebrated at Beauvais. They chose a 
young woman, the handsomest in the 
town ; made her ride on an ass richly 
harnessed, and placed in her amas a 
pretty infant. In this state, followed b&gt; 
the bishop and clergy, she marched in 
procession from the cathedral to tlie 
church of St. Stephen ; entered into the 
sanctuaiy, placed herself near the altar, 
and then celebrated mass ; not forgetting 
to explain the fine qualities of the ani- 
mal, and exhorting him to make a de- 
vout genuflection, with a variety of 
other fooleries.

sansations or emotions of the miiid pro- 
duced by the views we have of religion. 
While some enthusiasts boast of, depend 
on, and talk much of their feelings, tnere 
are others who are led to discard the 
term, and almost to abandon the idea 
of religious feeling ; but it is evident, 
that however many have been mis- 
guided and deceived by their feelings, 
yet there is no such thing as religion 
without this. For instance; religion 
consists in contrition, repentance, and 
devotion : now, what is contrition but 
a feeling of sorrow for sin ? what is re- 
pentance but a feeling of hatred to it, 
with a relinquishing of it ? what is de- 
votioh but a feeling of love to God and 
his ways? Who can separate the idea 
of feeling from any of these acts ? The 
fact is this; religious feelings, like every 
thing else, have been abused ; and 
men, to avoid the imputation of fanati- 
cism have run into the opposite evil of 
lukewarnincs.s, and been content with 
f a system without feeling its energy.

FIFTH MONARCHY MEN, were 
a set of enthusiasts, in the time of Crom- 
well, who expected the sudden appear- 
ance of Christ to establish on earth a 
new monarchy or kingdom. In conse- 
quence of this illusion, some of them 
aimed at the subversion of all human 
govt^mjient. In ancient hiitoiy we 



read of four great monarchies, the As- 
syrian, Persian, Grecian, and the Ro- 
man ; and these men, believing that 
this new spiritual kingdom of Christ 
was to be the fifth, came to bear the 
name by which they were called. Their 
leader was Thomas Venner, a wine 
cooper, who, in his little couAenticle in 
Coleman-street, warmed his admirers 
with passionate expectations of a fifth 
universal monarchy, under the personal 
reign of King Jesus upon earth, and that 
the saints were to tiike the kingdom to 
themselves. To introduce this ima- 
ginary kingdom, they marched out of 
their meeting-house, towards St. Paul's 
church-yard, on Sunday, Jan. 6th, 1660, 
to the number of about fifty men, well 
armed, and with a resolution to sub\ ert 
the present government, or to die in 
the attempt. They published a decla- 
ration of the design of their rising, and 
placed sentinels at proper places. The 
lord mayor sent the trained bands to 
disperse them, whom they quickly rout- 
ed, but in the evening retired to Cane 
Wood, between Highgate and Hamp- 
stead. On Wednesday morning they 
returned and dispersed a party of the 
king's soldiers in Thread-needle-street. 
In Wood-street they repelled the train- 
ed bands, and some of the horse guards^ 
but Venner himself was knocked down, 
and some of his company slain ; from 
hence the remainder retreated to Crip- 
plegate, and took possession of a house, 
which they threatened to defend with 
a desperate resolution ; but nobody ap- 
pearing to countenance their frenzy, 
they surrendered after they had lost 
about half their number. \ enner, and 
one of his officers, were hanged before 
their meeting house door in Coleman- 
street, Jan. 19th ; and a few days after 
nine more were executed in divers parts 
of the city. 

FILIAL PIETY, is the affectionate 
attachment of children to their parents, 
including in it love, reverence, obe- 
dience, and relief. Justly has it been 
observed, that these gi-eat duties are 
prompted equally by nature and by gra- 
titude, independent of the injunctions of 
religion ; for where shall we find the 
person who hath received from any one 
benefits so great, or so many, as chil- 
dren from their parents ? And it may 
be truly said that if persons are unduti- 
ful to their parents, they seldom prove 
good to any other relation. See article

FIRST FRUITS, among the He- 
brews, were oblations of part of t!ie 
fruits of the harvest, offered to God as 
an acknowledgment of his sovereign 
dominion. There was another sort r-f 
first fruits which was paid to God. 
\Vhen bread was kneaded in a family, 
a portion of it was set ai:)art, and given 
to the priest or Levite wlio dwelt in the 
place. If there were no priest or Le- 
vite there, it was cast into the oven, and 
consumed by the fii-e. These oiferings 
made a considerable part of the reve- 
nues of the priesthood, Lev. xxiii. Ex. 
xxii. 29. Chi-on. xxiii. 19. Numb. xv. 
19, 20. 

The Jirst fruits of the Spirit, are such 
communications of his grace on earth, 
as fully assure us of the fidl enjoyment 
of God in heaven, Rom. viii. 23. Christ 
is called the first fruits of them that 
slept; for as the first finiits were ear- 
nests to the Jews of the succeeding har- 
vest, so Christ is the first fruits of the 
resurrection, or the earnest of a future 
resurrection ; that as he rose, so shall 
believers also rise to happiness, and life. 
1 Cor. XV. 20. 

First fruits are mentioned in ancient 
^VTiters as one part of the church re- 
venue. 

First fruits, in the church of England, 
are the profits of every spiritual bene- 
fice for the first year, according to the 
valuation thereof in the king's book. 

FIVE POINTS, are the five doc- 
trines controverted between the Armi- 
nians and Calvinists. See Calvinists. 

FLACIANS, the followers of Mat- 
thias Flacius lUyricus, who flourished 
in the sixteenth centuiy. He taught 
that original sin is the very substance 
of human nature ; and that the fall of 
man was an event which extinguished 
in the human mind everj-^ virtuous ten- 
dency, every noble faculty, and left no- 
thing behind it but universal darkness 
and corruption. 

FLAGELLANTES. See Whip- 

PERS. 

FLATTERY, a servile and fawning 
behaviour, attended with servile com- 
pliances and obsequiousness, in order to 
gain aperson's favour. 

FLEMINGIANS, or Flandrians, 
a sect of rigid Anabaptists, who ac- 
quired this name in the sixteenth cen- 
tury, because most of them were na- 
tives of Flanders, by way of distinction 
from the Waterlandians. See Wate r - 

LANDIANS. 

FOLLY, accoitling to Mr. Locke, 
consists in the drawing of false conclu- 
sions from just principles, by which it 
is distinguished from madness, which 



draws just conclusions from false priii- 
ciples. But this seems too confined a 
definition. Folly, in its most general 
acceptation, denotes a weakness of in- 
tellect or apprehension, or some partial 
absurdity m sentiment or conduct See 
Rvn,, Sin. 

FOOL, one who has not the use of 
reason or judgment. In Scripture, wick- 
ed persons are often called fools, or fool- 
ish, because such act contrary to reason, 
trust to their own hearts, violate the 
laws of God, and prefer things vile, tri- 
fling, and temporal, to such as are im- 
portant, divine, and eternal. 

FOOLISH SPEAKING, such kind 
of conversation, as includes folly, and 
can no ways be profitable and interest- 
ing, Eph. V. 4. Facetiousness, indeed, is 
allowable, when it ministers to harm- 
less di\ ertisement, and delight to con- 
versation ; when it is used for the pur- 
pose of exposing things which ai'e base 
and vile ; when it has tor its aim the re- 
formation of others; when used by way 
of defence under unjust i-eproach. But 
all such kind of speaking as inchides 
profane jesting, loose, wanton, scumlous, 
injurious, unseasonable, vain-glorious 
talk, is strictly forbidden. See Barrow's 
excellent Sermon on this subject in his 
Works, vol. i. ser. 14-. 

FORBEARANCE, is the act of pa- 
tiently enduring provocation or offence. 
Tlie following may be considered as 
the most powerful incentives to the ex- 
ercise of this disposition : — -1. The con- 
sideration that we ourselves often stand 
in need of it from others. Gal. vi. 1. — . 
2. The express command of Scripture, 
Eph. iv. 2. Col. iii. 13.— 3. The felicity 
of^ this disposition. It is sure to bring 
happiness at last, while resentment 
only increases our own misery. — 4. 
That it is one of the strongest CAaden- 
ces we can give of the reality of our re- 
ligion, John xiii. 35. — 5. The beautiful 
example of Christ, Heb. xii. 3. 1 Pet. ii. 
21—23. 

FORBEARANCE OF GOD. See 
Patience of God. 

FOREKNOWLEDGE OF GOD, 
is his foresight or knowledge of every 
thing that is to come to pass. Acts ii. 
23. This foreknowledge, says Char- 
nock, was from eternitv. Seeing he 
knows things possible in his power, and 
things future in his will, if his power 
and resolves were from eternity, his 
knowledge must be so too ; or efse we 
must make him ignorant of his own 
power, and ignorant of his own will 
from eternity, and consequently not 
from eternity blessed and perfect. His 
knowledge of possible thmgs must run

parallel with liis will. If he willed from 
eternity, he knew from eternity Avhut 
he willed ; but that he did will from 
eternity we must grant, unless we would 
render him changeable, and conceive 
him to be made in time of not willing, 
willing. The knowledge God hath in 
time was always one and the same, be- 
cause his understanding is his proper 
essence, as perfect as his essence, and 
of an immutable nature. 

"To deny this is, (says Saurin,) to 
degrade the Almighty; for what, pray, 
is a God who created beings, and who 
could not foresee what would result 
from their existence .•• A God, who 
formed spirits imited to bodies by cer- 
tain laws, and who did not know how to 
combine these laws so as to foresee the 
effects they would produce ? A God 
forced to suspend his judgment.-' A 
God who every day learns something 
new, and who doth not know to-day 
what will happen to-morrow i" A (iod 
who cannot tell whether peace v/i!l be 
concluded or war continue to ravage 
the wC'ild; whether religion will be re- 
ceived in a certain kingdom, or whether 
it will be banished ; whether the right 
heir will succeed to the crown, or whe- 
ther the crown will be set on the head 
&lt;)f an usvn-per ? For according to the 
different detemiinations of the wills of 
men, o.^ king, or people, the prince \v\\\ 
make peace, or declare Avar ; religion 
•svill be banished or admitted ; the ty- 
rant or the lawful king will occupy the 
throne : for if God cannot foresee how 
the volitions of men will be determined, 
he cannot ibresee any of these events. 
What is this but to degrade God fj'om 
his Deity, and to make the most perfect 
of all intelligences a being involved in 
darkness and uncertainty like our- 
fielves?" See Omniscience. 

FORGIVENESS, the pardon of any 
offence committed against us. This is 
a virtue which our Lord expressly in- 
culcates, not as extending to our friends 
only, but to our enemies. "Ye have 
heard," saith he, "Thou shalt love thy 
neighbour, and hate thine enemy ; but 
I say unto you, love your enemies," &amp;c. 
" This," says an ingenious writer, " was 
a lesson so new, and utterly unknown, 
till taught by his doctrines and enforced 
by his example, that the wisest moral- 
ists of the wisest nations and ages re- 
])resented the desire of revenge as a 
mark of a noble mind ; but how much 
more magnanimous, how much more 
beneficial to mankind, is forgiveness ! 
It is more magnanimous, because every 
generous and exalted disposition of the 
human mind is requisite to the practice 



of it ; and it is the most beneficial, be- 
cause it ])uts an end to an eternal suc- 
cession of injuries and retaliations." 
Let us, therefore, leam to cherish this 
noble disposition ; let the bitterest ene- 
my we have be softened by its effects ; 
let us consider also how friendly it is to 
our own happiness, and how much it 
pi events the unhappiness of others. 
"The feuds and animosities, in families, 
and between neighbours, which disturb 
the intercourse of human life, and col- 
lectively compose half the misery of it, 
have tlieir foundation in the want of a 
forgiving temper, and can never cease 
but by the exercise of this virtue on 
one side, or on both." Paley's Mor.

FORNICATION, whoredom, or the 
act of incontinency between single per- 
sons; for if either of the parties be 
married, it is adultery. VVhile the 
Scriptures give no sanction to those 
austerities which have been imposed on 
men under the idea of religion, so on 
the other hand, they give no liberty for 
the indulgence of any propensity that 
would either militate against our own 
interest or that of others. It is in vain 
to argue the innocency of fornication 
from the natural passions implanted in 
us, sbice "marriage is honourable in 
all," and wisely appointed for the pre- 
vention of those evils which would 
otherwise ensue ; and, besides the exis- 
tence of any natural propensity in us, is 
no proof that it is to be gratified with- 
out any restriction. That fornication is 
both unlawful and unreasonable, may 
be easily inferred, if we consider, 1. 
That our Saviour expressly declares 
this to be a crime, Mark vii. 21 — 23. — 
2. That the Scriptures declare that

FORTITUDE is a virtue or quality 
of the mind generally considered the 
same with courage ; though, in a more 
accurate sen^e, they seem to be distin- 
guishable. Courage resists danger, for- 
titude suppoi'ts pain. Courage may be 
a virtue or vice, according to the cir- 
cumstances ; fortitude is always a vir- 
tue : we speak of desperate courage, 
but not of desperate fortitude. A con- 
tempt or neglect of danger may be call- 
ed courage ; but foilitude is the virtue 
of a rational and considerate mind, and 
is foimded in a sense of honour, and a 
regai'd to dut&gt;'. 

Christian fortitude may be defined 
that state of mind which arises from 
trath and confidence in God ; enaliles us 
to stand collected and undisturbed in the 
time of difficulty and danger ; and is at 
an equal distance from rashness on the 
one hand, and pusillanimity on the other. 
Fortitude takes different names, accord- 
ing as it acts in opposition to different 
evils ; but some ot those names are ap- 
l&gt;lied with considerable latitude. With 
respect to danger in general, fortitude 
has been called intrejiidity ; with re- 
spect to the dangers of war, valour; 
with respect to pain of body, or distress 
of mind, patience; with respect to la- 
bour, activity; with respect to injury, 
forbearance ; with respect to our con- 
dition in general, magnanimity. 

_ Christian fortitude is necessary to vi- 
gilance, patience, self-denial, and per- 
severance ; and is requisite under af- 
fliction, temptation, ijersecution, deser- 
tion, and death. The noble cause in 
which the Christian is engaged ; the 
glorious Master whom he serves; the 
provision that is made for his security ; 
the illustrious examples set before him ; 
the approbation of a good conscience ; 
and the grand prospect he has in view, 
are all powerful motives to the exercise 
of this grace. Watts' s Ser. ser. 31.

FORTUNE, a name which, among 
the ancients, seemed to have denoted a 
principle of fortuity, whereby things 
came to pass without being necessitated 
thereto; but Avhat and whence that 
principle is, they do not seem to have 
ever precisely tliought. It does not ap- 
pear that the antiquity of the word is 
very high. It is acknowledged, on all 
hands, that Tuxn, from wlience the Ro- 
mans took their fortnna, was a term 
invented long after the times of Hesiod 
and Homer, in whose writings it no 
where occurs. The philosophical sense 
of the word coincides with what is vul- 
garly called chance. It is difficult to as- 
certain what it denotes in the minds of 
those who now use the word. It has 
been justly observed, tliat they who 
would substitute the name of provi- 
dence in lieu of that of fortune, cannot 
give any tolerable sense to half the 
phrases wherein the word occurs. 

FRAME. Tills word is used to de- 
note any state of mind a man may be in ; 
and, in a religious sense, is often con- 
nected with the word feeling, or used 
synonymously with it. See Feeling. 

" If our frames are comfortable," 
says one, "we may make them the mat- 
ter of our praise, but not of our pride ; 
we may make tliem our pleasure, but 
not our portion ; we may make them 
the matter of our encouragement, but 
not the ground of our security. Are oiir 
frames dark and uncomfortaljle ? they 
should humble us, but not discourage 
us ; they should quicken us, biit not ob 
struct us in our application for neces- 
sary and suitabte grace ; they should 
make us see our own emptiness, but not 
make us suspect the fulness of Christ ; 
they should make us see our own un- 
worthiness, but not make us suspect the 
willingness of Christ; they should make 
us see our own weakness, but not cause 
us to suspect the strength of Chiist ; 
they should make us suspect our own 
hearts, but not the firmness and freeness 
of the promises." 

FRANCISCANS, a religious order 
founded by St. Francis in the year 1209. 
Francis was the son of a merchant of 
Assisi, in the province of Umbria, who, 
having led a dissolute life, was reclaim- 
ed by a fit of sickness, and afterwards 
fell into an extravagant devotion that 
looked less like religion than alienation 
of mind. Soon after this, viz. in the year 
1208, hearing the passage repeated in 
which Christ addresses his apostles, 
Provide neither gold nor silver, &amp;c. 
Matt. X. 9, 10. he was led to consider a 
voluntary and absolute poverty as the 
essence of the Gospel, and to prescribe

this poverty as a sacred inile both to 
Jiimself and to the few that followed 
him. This new society, which appeared 
to Innocent III. exti-emely adapted to 
the present state of the church, and pro- 
per to restore its declining credit, was 
solemnly approved and confirmed by 
Honorius III. in 1223, and had made a 
considerable progress before the death 
of its founder in 1226. Fi-ancis, through 
an excessive humility, would not suffer 
the monks of his order to be called /ra- 
tres, i. e. brethren or friars; hvit f rut er- 
culi, i. e. little brethren, or friars mi- 
nor, by which denomination they liave 
been generally since distinguished. The 
Franciscans and Dominicans were zeal- 
ous and active friends to the papal hie- 
rarchy, and in return were distinguished 
by peculiar privileges and honourable 
employments. The Franciscans, in par- 
ticular, were invested with the. treasure 
of ample and extensive indulgences, the 
distribution of which was committed to 
them by the popes as a mean of subsis- 
tence, and a rich indemnificatini for 
their voluntary po\'erty. In consequence 
of this grant, the rule of the founder, 
which absolutely prohibited both per- 
sonal and collective property, so that 
neither the individual nor the commu- 
nity were to possess either fund, reve- 
nue, or any worldly goods, was consi- 
dered as too strict and severe, and dis- 
pensed with soon after his death. In 
1231, Gregory IX. published an inter- 
pretation of this rule, mitigating its ri- 
gour; which was farther coniirmed by 
Innocent IV. in 1245, and by Alexander 
IV. in 1247. These milder operations 
were zealously opposed by a branch of 
the Franciscans, called the spiritual ; 
and their complaints were regarded by 
Nicholas III. who, in 1279, published a 
famous constitution, confirming the rule 
of St. Fi'ancis, and containing an elabo- 
rate explication of the maxims he re- 
commended, and the duties he prescri- 
bed. In 12&lt;S7, Matthew, of Aqua Spar- 
ta, being elected general of the order, 
discouraged the ancient discipline of the 
Franciscans, and indulged his monks in 
abandoning even the appearance of po- 
verty ; and this conduct inflamed the 
indignation of the spiritual or austere 
Franciscans ; so that, from the year 
1290, seditions and schisms arose in an 
order that had been so famous for its 
pretended disinterestedness and humili- 
ty. Such was the enthusiastic frenzy of 
the Franciscans, that they impiously 
maintained that the founder of their or- 
der was a second Christ, in all respects 
similar to the first, and that tlieir insti- 
tution and discipline were the true Gos- 



pel of Jesus. Accordingly Albizi, a 
Franciscan, of Pisa, published a book in 
1383, with the applause of his order, en- 
titled the Book of the Conformities of 
St. Francis with Jesus Christ. In the 
beginning of this century the whole 
Franciscan order was divided into two 
parties ; the one embracing the severe 
discipline and absolute poverty of St. 
Francis, and were called sfiirituals; and 
the other, who insisted on mitigating 
the austere injunctions of their founder, 
were denominated brethren of the com- 
munity. These wore long, loose, and 
good habits, with large hoods ; the for- 
mer were clad in a strait, coarse, and 
short dress, pretending that this dress 
was enjoined by St. Francis, and that no 

Sower on earth had a right to alter it. 
feither the moderation of Clement V. 
nor the violence of John XXII. could 
appease the tumult occasioned by these 
two parties: however, their rage sub- 
sided from the year 1529. In 1368 these 
two parties were formed into two large 
bodies, comprehending the whole Fran- 
ciscan order, viz. the conventual bre- 
thren, and the brethren of the obser- 
vance, or obsein.'ation, from whom 
sprang the Capuchins and Recollects. 
The general opinion is, that the Fran- 
ciscans came into England in the year 
1224, and had their first house at Can- 
terbury, and their second at London ; 
i)ut there is no certain account of their 
being here till king Henry VII. built 
two or three houses for them. At the 
dissolution of the monasteries, the con- 
ventual Franciscans had about fifty-five 
houses, which were under seven custo- 
dies or wardenships, viz. those of Lon- 
don, Worcester, \ ork, Cambridge, Bris- 
tol, Newcastle, and Oxford. 

FRATERNITY, in the Roman Ca- 
tholic counti'ies, signifies a society for 
the improvement of devotion. Of these 
there are several sorts, as, 1. The fra- 
ternity of the Rosaiy, founded by St. 
Dominic. It is divided into two branches, 
called the common rosary, and the fier- 
petual rosary; the former of whom are 
obliged to confess and communicate 
every first Sunday in the month, and 
the latter to repeat the rosary continu- 
ally. — 2. The fraternity of the Scapula- 
ry, whom it is pretended, according to 
the Sabbatine bull of pope John XXII. 
the Blessed Virgin has promised to de- 
liver out of hell the first Sunday after 
their death. — 3. The fraternity of St. 
Francis's girdle are clothed with a sack 
of a grey colour, which they tie with a 
cord; and in processions walk bare- 
footed, carrying in their hands a wooden 
cross. — 4. That of St. Austin's leather

girdle, comprehends a great many de- 
votees. Italy, Spain, and Portugal, are 
the countries where are seen the great- 
est number of these fraternities, some 
of which assume the name of arch-fra- 
ternity. Pope Clement VII. instituted 
tlie arch-fraternity of charity, which 
distributes bread every Simday among 
the poor, and gi\es jiortions to forty 
poor girls on the feast of St. Jerome, 
their patron. The fraternity of deatli 
buries such dead as are abandoned l)y 
their relations, and causes masses to be 
celebrated for them. 

FRATRICELLI,an enthusiastic sect 
of Franciscans, which arose in Italy, and 
particularly in the marquisate of Anco- 
na, about the year 1294. The word is 
an Italian diminutive, signifying frater- 
culi, or "little brothers," and was. here 
used as a term of derision, as they Avere 
most of them apostate monks, Avhom 
the Italians call fratclli or fratrkelli. 
For this reason, the term fratrkelli, as 
a nick-name, was given to mnny otiier 
sects, as tlie Catharists, the \^'aldenses, 
&amp;c. however different in their opinions 
and their conduct. But this denomina- 
tion, applied to the austere part of the 
Franciscans, was considered as honour- 
able. See Franciscans. 

The founders of this sect were P. 
Maurato and P. de Fossombroni, who, 
having obtained of Pope Celestin V. a 
permission to live in solitude after the 
manner of hermits, and to observe the 
rule of St. Francis in all its rigour, seve- 
ral idle vagabond monks joined them, 
who, living after their own fancies, and 
making all perfection to consist in po- 
verty, were soon condemned by pope 
Boniface VIII. and his successor, and 
the inquisitors ordered to proceed 
against them as heretics : which com- 
mission they executed with their usual 
barbarity. Upon this, retiring into Si- 
cily, Peter John Oliva de Serignan had 
no sooner published his comment on the 
Apocalvpse, than they adopted his te- 
nets. Tliey held the Romish church to 
be Babylon, and proposed to establish 
another far more perfect one: they 
maintained that the rule of St. Francis 
was the evangelical rule observed by 
Jesus Christ and his apostles. They 
foretold the reformation of the church, 
and the restoration of the true Gospel 
of Christ, by the genuine followers of 
St. Francis ; and declared their assent 
to almost all the doctrines which were 

fiublishcd under the name of the abbot 
oachim, m the "Introduction to the 
Everlasting Gospel," a book published 
in 1250, and explauied by one of the 
spiritual friars, whose name was Ger- 



hard. Among other errors inculcated 'vi\ 
this book, it is pretended that St. Fran- 
cis was the angel mentioned in Rev. xiv, 
6, and had promulgated to the world 
the tiTie and everlasting Gospel ; that 
the Gospel of Christ was to be abi'oga- 
ted in 1260, and to give place to this 
new and everlasting Gospel, which was 
to be substituted in its room ; and that 
tlie ministers of this great reformation 
v/ere to be humble and barefooted 
friars, destitute of all worldly employ- 
ments. Some say, they even elected a 
pope of their church ; at least they ap- 
pointed a general with superiors, and 
built monasteries, &amp;c. Besides the opi- 
nions of Oliva, they held that the sacra- 
ments of the church were invalid, be- 
cause those who administered them had 
no longer any power or jurisdiction. 
Thc}^ were condemned again by pope 
John XXII. in consequence of wliose 
cruelty they regarded him as the true 
antichrist ; but several of them, retura- 
ing into Germany, were sheltered by 
Lewis, duke of Bavaria, the emperor. 

There are authentic records, from 
which it appears, that no less than 2000 
persons were burnt by the inquisition, 
from the year 1318 to the time of Inno- 
cent VI. for their inflexible attachment 
to the order of St. Francis. The se&gt;'eri- 
ties against them were again revived, 
towards the close of the fifteenth centu- 
ry, by pope Nicholas V. and his succes- 
sors. However, all the persecutions 
which this sect endured were not suffi- 
cient to extinguish it; for it subsisted 
until the times of the refonnation in 
Germany, when its remaining votaries 
adopted the cause and embraced the 
doctrine and discipline of Luther. ^

FREE AGENCY is the power of 
following one's inclination, or Avhatever 
the soul does, with the full bent of pre- 
ference and desire. Many and long nave 
been the disputes on this subject ; not 
that man has been denied to be a free 
agent ; but the dispute has been in what 
it consists. See articles Liberty and 
Will. A distinction is made by wri- 
ters between free agency, and what is 
called the Arminian notion of free will. 
The one consists merely in the power of 
following our prevailing inclination ; the 
other in a supposed power of acting 
contrary to it, or at least of changing it. 
The one predicates fi-eedom of the 
man ; the other, of a faculty in man , 
which Mr. Locke, though an anti-ne- 
cessarian, explodes as an absurdity. 
The one goes merely to render us ac-

FRENCH PROPHETS. They first 
appeared in Dau])liiny and Vivarais. In 
the year 168*8, five or six hundred Pro- 
testants of both sexes gave tliemseh'es 
out to be prophets, and inspired of the 
Holy Ghost. They soon became so nu- 
merous, that there v/ere many thou- 
sands of them inspired. They were 
people of all ages and sexes without 
distinction, though the greatest part of 
them were boys and girls from six or 
seven to twenty-five years of age. They 
had strange fit's, which came upon them 
with tre\nblings and faintings as in a 
swoon, which made them stretch out 
their arms and legs, and stagger several 
times before they dropped down. They 
stiuck. themselves with their hands, 
they fell on their backs, shut their eyes, 
and he^'ed with their lireasts. They 
regained a while in trances, and, com- 
ing out of them with twitchings, uttered 
all which came in their mouths. They 
said they saw the heavens open, the 
angels, paradise, and hell. Those who 
were just on the point of receiving the 
spirit of pi'ophecy, dropped down not 
only in the assemblies, crying out inercy, 
but in the fields, and in their own houses. 
The least of their assemblies made up 
four or five hundred, and some of them 
amounted to even three or four thou- 
sand persons. When the prophets had 
for a while been under agitations of 
body, they began to prophesy. The bur- 
den of their prophecies was. Amend 
your lives ; repent ye: the end of all 
things draws nigh! The hUls rebound- 
ed with their loud cries for m,ercy, and 
imprecations against the priests, the 
church, the pope, and against the anti- 
christian dominion, with predictions of 
the approaching fall of pope,ry All 



they said at these tiroes was lieavd and 
received with reverence and awe. 

In the year 1706, three or fonr of these, 
prophets came over into England, and 
brought their prophetic spirit along 
with them, which discovered itself in 
the same ways and nianners, by ecsta- 
cies, and agitations, and inspirations un- 
der them, as it had done in France ; and 
they propagated the like spirit to others, 
so thrift before the year was out there 
were tM'o or three hundred of these 
prophets in and about London, of both 
sexes, of all ages ; men, women, and 
children: and they had delivered under 
inspiration four or five hundred pro- 
phetic warnings. 

The great things they pretended by 
their spirit was, to give warning of the 
near a/iproach of the kingdom of God, 
the hafifiy times" of the church, the mil- 
lennium 'state. Their message was (and 
they were to proclaim it as heralds to 
the Jews, and everv nation under hea- 
ven, beginning at ^England,) that the 
grand jutiilee, the acceptable year of 
the Lord, the accomplishment of those 
numerous Scriptures concerning the 
new heaven and tlie ne\V earth, the 
kingdom of the JMcssiah, the marriage 
of the Lamb, the first resurrection, or 
the new Jerusalem desceriding from 
above, were now even at the door; that 
this great operation was to be wrought 
on the part of man by spiritual arms 
only, proceeding from the mouths of 
those who should by inspiration, or the 
mighty gift of the Spirit, be sent forth in 
great numbers to laljour in the vine- 
yard ; that this mission of his servants 
should be witnessed to by signs and 
wonders from heaven, by a deluge of 
judgments on tlie wicked universally 
throughout the world, as famine, pesti- 
lence, earthquakes, &amp;c. that the exter- 
minating angels shall root out the tares, 
and there shall remain upon earth only 
good corn ; and the works of men being 
thrown down, there shall be but one 
Lord, one faith, one heart, one v(nce 
among mankind. They declared that 
all the great things they spoke of would 
be manifest over the whole earth with- 
in the term of three years. 

'i'hese prophets also pretended to the 
gift of languages, of discerning the se- 
crets of the heart, the gift of ministra- 
tion of the same spirit to others by the 
laying on of the hands, and the gift of 
healing. To prove they were really in- 
spired by the Holy Ghost, they alleged 
the complete joy and satisfaction they 
experienced, the spirit of prayer which 
was poured forth upon tlieni, and the 
ans^.ver of their prayer by God. 



FRI

FRIAR (brother,) a term common to 
the monks of all orders. In a more pe- 
culiar sense, it is restrained to such 
monks as are not priests : for those in 
orders are usually dignified with the 
appellatiofi of father. 

FRIENDSHIP, a mutual attachment 
subsisting between two persons, and 
arising not merely from the general 
principle of benevolence, from emotions 
of gratitude for fa\ ours received, from 
views of interest, nor from instinctive 
affection or animal passion ; but from an 
opinion entertained by each of them 
that the other is adorned with some 
amiable or respectable qualities. Vari- 
ous have been the opinions respecting 
friendship. Some have asserted tliat 
there is no such thing in the world ; 
others have excluded it from the list of 
Christian virtues ; while others, believ- 
ing the possibility of its existence, sup- 
pose that it is very rare. To the two 
former remarks we may reply, that 
there is every reason to believe that 
there has been, and is such a thing as 
friendship. The Scriptures present us 
both with examples of, and precepts 
concerning it. David and Jonathan, 
Paul and Timothy, our Lord and La- 
zarus, as well as John, are striking in- 
stances of friendship. Solomon exhorts 
us in language so energetic, as at once 
shews it to be our duty to cultivate it. 
** Thine own friend, and thy fathei''s 
friend, forsake not." " Make sure of 
thy friend, for faithful are the wounds 
of a friend," 8cc. The genius and in- 
junctions of the Christian religion seem 
also to inculcate this \'irtue ; for it not 
only commands universal benevolence 
to men, but promotes the strongest love 
and friendship between those whose 
minds are enlightened by divine grace, 
and who behold in each other the image 
of their Divine Master. As friendship, 
however, is not enjoyed by every one, 
and as the want of it rises often from 
ourselves, we shall here subjoin, from 
an eminent writer, a few remarks by 
way of advice respecting it. 1. We 
must not expect perfection in any with 
whom we contract fellowship. — 2. We 
nriust not be hurt by differences of opi- 
nion arising in intercourse with our 
friends. — 3. It is material to the preser- 
vation of friendship, that openness of 
temper and obliging manners on both 
hanc'S be cultivated. — 4. We must not 
listen rashly to evil reports against our 
friends. — 5. We must not desert oui' 
friends in danger or distress. Bloir's

FUNERAL RITES, ceremonies ac- 
companying the interment or burial of 
anv person. 

The first people who seemed to have 
paid any attention to their dead were 
tlie Egyptians. They took great care 
in embalming their bodies, and building- 
proper repositories for them. This 
gave birth to those wonders of the 
Avorld, tlic Egyptian pyramids. On the 
death of any ])erson among them, the 
parents and friends put on mournful 
habits, and abstained from all banquets 
and entertainments. This mourning 
lasted from forty to seventy days, during 
which time they embalmed the bod). 
Before the dead were allowed to be de- 
posited in the tomb, they underwent a 
solemn judgment. If any one stepped 
forth, accused them, and proved that 
the deceased had led an evil life, the 
judges pronoimced sentence, and the 
body was pi'ecluded from burial. Even 
their sovereigns underwent this judica- 
ture ; and Diodorus Siculus asserts, that 
many kings had been deprived of the 
honours of burial, and that the terrors 
of such a fate had a salutary influence 
on the virtue of their kings. 

The funeral rites among the Hebrews 
were solemn and magnificent. The re- 
lations and friends rent their clothes j' 
and it was usual to bend the dead per- 
son's thumb into the hand, and fasten it 
in that posture with a string, because 
the thumb then having the figure of the 
name of God, they thought the devil 
would not approach it. They made a 
funeral oration at the grave, after which 
they prayed ; then turning the face of 
the deceased towai'ds heaven, they said, 
"Go in peace." 

The Greeks used to put a piece of 
money in the mouth of the deceased, 
which was thought to be the fare over 
the infernal river : they abstained from 
banquets; tore, cut, or shaved their 
hair; sometimes throwing themselves

oil tlie ground, and rolling in the dust ; 
beating their breasts, and even tearing 
their flesh with their nails. 

The funeral rites among the Romans 
were very numerous. — ^They k.e]it the 
deceased seven days, and washed him 
every day with hot Avater, and some- 
times with oil, if possibly lie might be 
revived, in case he were only in a slum- 
ber; and every now and then his friends, 
meeting, made a liorrible shout with 
the same view : but if they found he did 
not revive, he was dressed and embalm- 
ed with a performance of a variety of 
singular cei'emonies, and at last bi'ought 
to the funeral pile, and burnt : after 
which his ashes were gathered, inclosed 
in an urn, and deposited in the sejjulchre 
or tomb. 

The ancient Christians testified their 
abhorrence of the pagan custom of burn- 
ing their dead, and always deposited 
the body entire in the ground ; and it 
was usual to bestow the honour of em- 
balming upon the maityrs, at least, if 
not upon others. They prepai't-d the 
body tor burial by washing it with wa- 
ter, and dressing it in a funeral attire. 
This was performed by near relations, 
or persons of such dignity as the cir- 
cumstances of the deceased reOjUired. 
Psalmody, or singing of psalms, was the 
great ceremony used in all funeral pro- 
cessions among the ancient Christians. 

In the Romisli church, when a person 
is dead, they wash the body, and put a 
crucifix in his hand. At the feet stands 
a vessel of holy water, and a sprinkler, 
that they who come in may sprinkle 
both themselves and the deceased. In 
the mean time some priest stands bv 
the coi-pse, and prays for the deceased 
till it is laid in the earth. In the fune- 
ral procession the exorcist walks fii-st, 
carrying the holy water; next the cross 
bearer ; afterwards the rest of the cler- 
gv ; and, last of all, the officiating priest. 
They all sing the miserere, and some 
other psalms ; and at the end of each 
j)salm a requiem. It is said, that the 
Faces of deceased laymen must be turn- 
ed towards the altar when they are 
placed in the church, and those of the 
clergy towards the people. I'he corpse 
is placed in the church, surrounded with 
lighted tapers. After the office for the 
dead, mass is said ; then the officiating 
priest sprinkles the coi-pse thrice with 
liol&gt;' water, and as often throws incense 
on it. The body being laid in the grave, 
the friends and the relations of the de- 
ceased sprinkle the grave with holy 
water. 

The funeral ceremonies of the Greek 
church art; much the same with those 



of the J^atin. It needs only to be ob- 
served, that, after the funeral service, 
they kiss the crucifix, and salute the 
mouth and forehead of the deceased ; 
after which, each of the company eats 
a bit of bread, and drinks a glass of 
wine in tlie church, wishing the soul a 
good repose, and the afflicted family all 
consolations. Binfffiain^s Antiqu. b. 2.

FUTURE STATE, a term made 
use of in relation to the existence of 
the soul after death. That there is such 
a state of existence, we have eveiy rea- 
son to believe ; " for if we suppose," 
says a good writer, " the events of this 
life to have no i-eference to another, the 
whole state of man becomes not only 
inexplicable, but contradictoiy and in- 
consistent. The powers of the inferior 
animals are perfectly suited to their 
station. They know nothing higher 
than their present condition. In gratify- 
ing their appetites, they fulfil their desti- 
ny, and pass away. — Man, alone, comes 
forth to act a part which carries no 
meaning, and tends to no end. Endow- 
ed with capacities which extend far be- 
yond his present sphere, fitted by his ra- 
tional nature for running the race of 
immortality, he is stopped short in tlie 
very entrance of his course. He squan- 
ders his activity on pursuits which he 
discerns to be vain. He languishes for 
knowledge which is placed beyond his 
reach. He thirsts after a happiness 
which he is doomed never to enjoy. He 
sees and laments the disasters of his 
state, and yet, upon this supposition, can 
find nothing to remedy them. Has the 
eternal God any pleasure in sporting 
himself with such a scene of misery and 
folly as this life (if it liad no connection 
with another) must exhibit to his eye ? 
Did he call into existence this magnifi- 
cent universe, adorn it with so much 
beauty and splendour, and surround it 
with those glorious luminaries which 
we behold in the heavens, only that 
some generations of mortal men might 
arise to behold these wonders, and then 
disapjjear for ever ? How unsuitable in 
this case were the habitation to the 
wretched inhabitant ! How inconsistent 
the commencement of his being, and 
the mighty pre]5aration of his powers 
and faculties, with his despicable end I 
How contradictory, in fine, were evety 
thing which concerns the state of man, 
to the wisdom and perfections of his 
Maker!" 

But that there is such a state is clear 
from many passages of the New Tes- 
tament, John V. 24. Acts vii. 9. Rom. 
viii. 10, 11. 2 Cor. V. 1, 2. Phil. i. 21.

1 Thess. iv. 14. 1 Thess. v. 10. Luke 
xvi. 22, &amp;c. But, though these texts 
prove tlve point, yet some have doubted 
whether there be any where in the Old 
Testament any reference to a future 
state at all. The case, it is said, appears 
to be this : the Mosaic covenant contain- 
ed no promises directly relating to a 
future state ; probably, as Dr. VVarbur- 
ton asserts, and argues at large, because 
Moses was secure of an equal provi- 
dence, and therefore needed not subsi- 
diaiy sanctions taken from a future 
stafc, without the belief of which the 
doctrine of an universal providence can- 
not ordinarily be vindicated, nor the 
eeneual sanctions of religion secured. 
But, in opposition to this sentiment, as 
Doddridge observes, " it is evident that 
good men, even before Moses, were 
animated by views of a future state, 
Heb. xi. 13, 16, as he himself plainly 
was, 24 to 26 vei-se ; and that the pro- 
mises of heavenly felicity were contain- 
ed even in the covenant made with 
Abraham, Avhich the Mosaic could not 
disannul. Succeeding providences also 
confirmed the natural argimients in its 
favour, as every remarkable interposi- 
tion would do ; and when general pro- 
mises were made to the obedient, and 
an equal providence relating to the na- 
tion established on national conformity 
to the Mosaic institution, and not merely 
to the general precepts of virtue ; as 
such an equal providence would neces- 
sarily involve many of the best men in 
national ruin, at a time when, by pre- 
sening their integritj' m the midst of 



general apostas}', their virtue was most 
conspicuous ; such good men, in such a 
state, would have vast additional rea- 
sons for expecting future rewards, be- 
yond what could arise from jjrinciples 
common to the rest *)f mankintl ; so that 
we cannot wonder that we find in the 
writings of the prophets many strong 
expressions of such an expectation, 
particularly Gen. xlix. 18. Ps. xvi. 9 to 
11. Ps. xvli. last ver. Ps. Ixxiii. 17, 27.

Is. xxvi. 19. The same thing may also 
be inferred from the particular promises 
made to Daniel, Dan. xii. 13. to Zerub- 
babel. Hag. ii. 23. and to Joshua, the 
high priest, Zech. iii. 7. as well as from 
those historical facts recorded in the 
Old Testament of the murder of Abel, 
the translation of Enoch and Elijah, the 
death of Moses, and the story of the

GAIANITjii, a denomination which 
derived its name from Gaian, a bishop 
of Alexandria, in the sixth centuiy, who 
denied that Jesus Christ, after the hy- 
postatical union, Avas subject to any of 
the infirmities of human nature. 

GALILEANS, a sect of the Jews 
which arose in Judea some years after 
the birth of our Saviour. They sprang 
from one Judas, a imtive of Gaulam, in 
upper Galilee, upon the occasion of Au- 
gustus appointing the people to be mus- 
tered, which they looked upon as an 
instance of servitude which all true Is- 
raelites ought to oppose. They pre- 
tended that God alone should be owned 
as master, and lord, and in other re- 
spects were of tlie opinion of the Phari- 
sees; but as they judged it unlawful to 



pray for infidel princes, they separated 
themselves from the rest of the Jews, 
and performed their sacrifices apait. 
As our Saviour and his apostles were of 
Galilee, they were suspected to be of 
the sect of the Galileans ; and it was on 
this principle, as St. Jerome observes, 
that the Pharisees laid a snare for him, 
asking, Whether it were lawful to give 
tribute to Czesar? that in case he denied 
it, the}' might have an occasion of ac- 
cusing him. 

GAZARES, a denomination which 
appeared about 1197 at Gazare, a town 
of Dalmatia. They held almost the 
sanie opinions with the Albigenses ; but 
their distinguishing tenet was, that no 
human power had a right to sentence 
men to death for anv crime whatever.

GENERAL CALL. See Calling. 

GENERATION, ETERNAL, is a 
term used as descriptive of the Father's 
communicating the Divine Nature to 
the Son. The Father is said by some 
divines to have produced the Word, or 
Son, from all eternity, by way of gene- 
ration ; on which occasion the word 
generation raises a peculiar idea: that 
procession which is really affected in 
the way of understanding is called gene- 
ration, because, in virtue thereof, the 
Word becomes like to Him from whom 
he takes the original ; or, as St. Paul 
expresses it, the figure or image of his 
substance ; i. e. of his being and nature. 
— And hence it is, they say, that the 
second person is called the Son ; and 
that in such a way and manner as never 
any other was, is, or can be, because 
of his own divine nature, he being the 
time, proper, and natural Son of God, 
begotten by him before all worlds. Thus, 
he is called his onv7i Son, Rom. viii. 3. 
his only begotten Son, John iii. 16. 
Many have attempted to explain the 
manner of this generation by different 
similitudes; but as they throw little or 
no light upon the subject, we shall not 
trouble the reader with them. Some, 
however, suppose that the term Son of 
God refers to Christ as mediator ; and 
that his Sonship does not lie in his di- 
vine or human nature, separately con- 
sidered, but in the union of botli in one 
person. See Luke i. 35. Matt. iv. 3. 
Jolm i. 49. Matt. xvi. 16. Acts ix. 20, 22. 
Rom. i. 4. It is observed, that it is im- 
possible that a nature properly divine 
should be begotten, since begetting, 
whatever idea is annexed to it, must 
signify some kind of production, deriva- 
tion, and inferiority ; consequently, that 
%v'hatever is produced must have a be- 
ginning, and whatever had a beginning 
Avas not from eternity, as Christ is said 
to be. Is. ix. 6. Col', i. 16, 17. That 
the Sonship of Christ respects him as 
mediator will Ije evident, if we com- 
pare John x. 30. with Jolin xiv. 28. In 
the former it is said, "I and my Fa- 
ther are one ;" in tlie latter, " My Fa- 
ther is greater than I." These decla- 
rations, however opposite they seem, 
equally respect liim as he is the Son ; 
but if his Sonship primarily and properly 
signify the generation of his divine na- 
ture, it will be difficult, if not impossi- 
ble, according to that scheme, to make 
them harmonize. Considered as a dis- 
tinct person in the Godhead, without 
respect to his office as mediator, it is 
impossible, that, in the same view, he 
should be both eijual and mferior to his 



Father. Again : he expressly tells us 
himself, that " the Son can do nothing of 
liimself ; that the Father showeth him 
all things that he doth ; and that he 
giveth him to have life in himself," 
John V. 19, 20, 26. which expressions, 
if applied to him as God, not as media- 
tor, will reduce us to the disagreeable 
necessity of subscribin.^ either to the 
creed of Arius, and maintain him to be 
God of ail inferior nature, and thus a 
plurality of Gods, or to embrace the 
doctrine of Socinus, who allows .him 
only to be a God by office. But if this 
title belong to him as mediator, every 
difficulty is removed. And, lastly, it is 
observed, that though Jesus bef God, 
and the attributes of eternal existence 
ascribed to him, yet the two attributes, 
eternal and son, are not once expressed 
in the same text as referring to eternal 
generation. See article Son of God;

GENEROSIT Y,the disposition which 
prompts us to bestow favours which are 
not the iiurchase of any particular merit. 
It is different from humanity. Huma- 
nity is an exquisite feeling we possess 
in relation to others, so as to grie\'e for 
their sufferings, resent their injuries, or 
to rejoice at their prosperity ; and as it 
arises from sympathy, it requires no 
great self-denial, or self-command ; but 
generosity is that by which we are led 
to prefer some other person to our- 
selves, and to sacrifice any interest of 
our own to the interest of another. 

GENIUS, a good or evil spirit or dx- 
mon, who the ancients supposed was 
set over each person to direct his birth, 
accompany him in his life, and to be his 
guard. 

Genius signifies that aptitude which 
a man naturally possesses to perform 
well and easily that which others can 
do but indifferently, and with a great 
deal of pain. 

GENTILE, in matters of religion, a 
Pagan, or worshipper of false gods. 
The origin of this word is deduced from 
the Jews, who called all those avIio 
were not of their name D"1J gojim, i. e. 
gentes, which in the Greek translation 
of the Old Testament is rendered ra 
sSvTi, in which sense it frequently occurs 
in the New Testament ; as m Matt. vi. 
32. " All these things the nations or 
Gentiles seek." Whence the Latin 



GEN 



197 



GIF 



church also used gentes in the same 
sense as our Gentiles, especially in tiie 
New Testament. But the word gentes 
soon got another signification, and no 
longer meant all such as were not Jews, 
but those only who were neither Jews 
nor Christians, bvit followed the super- 
stitions of the Greeks and Romans, &amp;c. 
In this sense it continued among the 
Christian writers, till their manner of 
speech, together with their religion, 
■was publicly, and by authority, recei\'ed 
in the empire, when gentiles, from gen- 
tes, came mto use ; and then both words 
had two significations ; viz. in treatises 
or laws concerning religion, they signi- 
fied Pagans, neither Jews nor Chris- 
tians ; and in civil affairs they are used 
for all such as were not Romans. See 
Heathen. Paganism. 

GENTLEN ESS, softness or mildness 
of disposition and behaviour. Little as 
this disposition is thought of by manv, 
we find it considered in Scripture as a 
characteristic of the tiiie Christian. 
"The wisdom that is from above," 
saith St. James, " is gentle," ch. iii. 17. 
" This gentleness, indeed, is to be dis- 
tinguished from passive tameness of 
spirit, and from unlimited compliance 
Avith the manners of others. That pas- 
sive tameness, which submits without a 
struggle to every encroachment of the 
violent and assuming, forms no part of 
Christian duty ; but, on the contrarv, 
is destructive of general happiness and 
order. That unlimited complaisance, 
which on every occasion falls in with 
the opinions and manners of others, is 
so far from being a virtue, that it is it- 
self a vice, and the parent of many 
vices. It overthrows all steadiness of 
principle, and produces that sinful con- 
formity with the world which taints 
the whole character. In the present 
corrapted state of human manners, al- 
ways to assent and to comply, is the 
very worst maxim we can adopt. Tnie 
gentleness, therefore, is to be carefully 
distinguished from the mean spirit of 
cowards and the fawning assent of syco- 
phants. It renounces no just right from 
fear; it gives up no important ti-uth 
from flattery : it is, indeed, not only con- 
sistent with a firm mind, but it neces- 
sarily rec^uires a manly spirit and a fix- 
ed principle, in order to give it any 
real value. It stands opposed to harsh- 
ness and severity, to pride and arro- 
gance, to violence and oppression : it is 
properly that part of charity which 
makes us unwilling to give pain to any 
of our brethren. Compassion prompts 
us to I'clieve their wants ; forbearance 
prevents us from retaliating their inju- 



ries; meekness restrains our anery 
passions ; candour our sevei'e judg- 
ments ; but gentleness corrects what- 
ever is offensive in our manner, and, by 
a constant train of humane attention^ 
studies to alleviate the burden of com- 
mon miserv." 

GENUFLECTION, the act of bow- 
ing or bending the knee, or rather of 
kneeling down. Th^ Jesuit Rosweyd, 
in his Onomasticon, shows that genu- 
flection, or kneeling, has been a very 
ancient custom in the church, and even 
under the Old Testament dispensation ; 
and that this practice was obsei-i-ed 
throughout all the year, excepting on 
Sunday's, and during the time from Eas- 
ter to Whitsuntide, when kneeling was 
forbidden Ijy the council of Nice. Others 
have shown, that the custom of not 
kneeling on Sundays had obtained from 
the time of the apostles, as appears from 
St. Irenxus and TertuUian ; and the 
Ethiopic church, scnipulously attached 
to the ancient ceremonies, still retains 
that of not kneeling at divine service. 
The Russians esteem it an indecent pos- 
ture to worship God on the knees. I'he 
Jews usually prayed standing. Baronius 
is of opinion that genuflection was not 
established in the year of Christ 58, 
from that passage iri Acts xx. 36, where 
St. Paul is expressly mentioned to kneel 
down at prayer ; but Saurin shows that 
nothing can be thence concluded. The 
same author remarks, also, that the 
primitive Christians carried the prac- 
tice of genuflection so far, that some of 
them had worn cavities in the floor 
where they prayed : and St. Jerome re- 
lates of St. James, that he had con- 
tracted a hardness on his knees equal 
to that of camels. 

GHOST, HOLY. See Holy Ghost. 

GIFT OF TONGUES, an ability 
given to the apostles of i*eadily and in- 
telligibly speaking a variety of languages 
which they had never learnt. This was 
a most glorious and important attesta- 
tion of the Gospel, as well as a suitable, 
and indeed, in their circumstances, a 
necessary furniture for the mission for 
which the apostles and their assistants 
were designed. Nor is there any rea- 
son, with Dr. Middleton, to understand 
it as merely an occasional gift, so that 
a person might speak a language most 
fluentl)^ one hour, and be entirely igno- 
rant of it in the next ; which neither 
agrees with what is said of the abuse of 
it, nor would have been suflicient to an- 
swer the end proposed. See Acts ii.

GILBERTINES, a religious order; 
thus called from St. Gilbert, of Sem- 
pringliam, in the county of Lincoln, who 
founded the same about the year 1148 ; 
the monks of which obser\-ed the iide 
of St. Augustine, and were accounted 
canons, and the nuns that of St. Bene- 
dict. The founder of this order erected 
a double monastery, or rather two dif- 
ferent ones, contiguous to each other; 
the one for men, the other for women, 
but parted by a very high wall. St. Gil- 
bert himself founded thirteen monaste- 
ries of this order ; viz. four for men alone, 
and nine for men and women together, 
which had in them 700 brethren, and 
1500 sisters. At the dissolution, there 
were about twenty-five houses of this 
order in England and Wales.

pro^ idence^ and grace. We may be said

GNOSIMACHI, a name which dis- 
tinguished those in the seventh century 
who were professed enemies to the 
Gnosis ; i. e. th&amp; studied knowledge or 
-science of Christianity, which they rest- 
ed wholly on good works ; calling it a 
useless labour to seek for knowledge in 
the Scripture. In short&gt; they contended 
for the practice of morality in all sim- 
plicity, and blamed those who aimed at 
improving and perfecting it by a deeper 
knowledge and insight into the doctrines 
and rnysteries of religion. The Gnosi- 
machi were the very reverse of the 
Gnostics. 

GNOSTICS, (from rvwo-nxot, know- 
ing,) ancient heretics, famous from the 
first rise of Christianity, principally hi 
the east. It ajipears from several pas- 
sages of Scripture, particularly 1 .lohn 
ii. 18 ; 1 Tim. vi. 20 ; Col. ii. 8 ; that 
many persons were infected with the 
Gnostic heresy in the first century ; 
though the sect did not render itself 
cons])icuous, either for numbers or re- 
putatiiin, before the time of Adrian, 
when some writers erroneously date its 



rise. The name was adopted by this 
sect, on the presumption that they were 
the only persons who had the true 
knoivleds^e of Christianity. Accordingly 
they looked on all other Christians as 
simple, ignorant, and barbarous persons, 
who explained and interpreted the sa- 
cred w ritings in a low, literal, and un- 
edifying signification. At first, the Gnos- 
tics were the only philosophers and wits 
of those times, who formed for them- 
selves a peculiar system of theology, 
agreeable to the philosophy of Pythago- 
ras and Plato; to which they accom- 
modated all their intei-pretations of 
Scripture. But Gnostics afterwards be- 
came a generical name, comprehending 
divers sects and parties of heretics, who 
rose in the first centuries; and who, 
though they differed among themselves 
as to circumstances, yet all agreed iii 
some common principles. They cor- 
rupted the doctnne of the Gospel by a ' 
profane mixture of the tenets of the ori- 
ental philosophy, concerning the origin 
of evil and the creation of the world, 
with its divine truths. Such were the 
Valentinians, Simonians, Caipocratians, 
Nicholaitans, 8cc. 

Gnostics sometimes also occurs in a 
good sense, in the ancient ecclesiastical 
writers, particularly Clemens Alexan- 
driiius, who, in the person of his Gnos- 
tic, describes the characters and quali- 
ties of a perfect Christian. This jjoint 
he labours in the seventh book of his 
Stromata, where he shows that none 
but the Gnostic, or learned person, has 
any true religion. He affirms, that, 
were it possible for the knowledge of 
Ciod to be separated from eternal salva- 
tion, the Gnostic would make no sci-uple 
to choose the knowledge; and that if 
God would promise him impunity in 
doing of any thing he has once spoken 
against, or offer him heaven on those 
terms, he would never alter a whit of 
his measures. In this sense the father 
uses Gnostics, in opposition to the here- 
tics of the same name ; affirming, that 
the true Gnostic is grown old in .the 
study of the holy Scripture, and that he 
preserves the orthodox doctrine of the 
apostles, and of the church ; whereas 
t'le false Gnostic abandons all the apos- 
tolical traditions, as imaginmg himself 
wiser than tlie apostles. 

Gnostics was sometimes also more 
particularly used for the successors of 
the Nicholaitans and Carpocratians, in 
the second century, upon their laying 
aside the names of the first authors. 
Such as would be thoroughly acquainted 
with all their doctrines, reveries, and vi- 
sions may consult St. Iraiseus, Tertul-

lian, Clemens Alexaiidrinus, Origen, 
and St. Efiiphanius ; particularly the 
first of these writers, who relates their 
sentiments at large, and confutes them. 
Indeed he dwells more on the Valen- 
tinians than any other sect of Gnostics ; 
but he shows the general principles 
whereon all their mistaken opinions 
were founded, and the method they fol- 
lowed in explaining Scripture. He ac- 
cuses them of introducing into religion 
certain vain and ridiculous genealogies, 
i. e. a kind of divine processions or ema- 
nations, which had no other foundation 
but in their own wild imagination. The 
Gnostics confessed, that these xons, or 
emanations, were no where expressly 
delivered in the sacred writings ; but 
insisted that Jesus Christ had intimated 
them in parables to such as could under- 
sttmd them. They built their theologj'^ 
not only on the Gospels and the epistles 
of St. j'aul, but also on the law of Mo- 
ses and the prophets. These last were 
peculiarly serviceable to them, on ac- 
count of the allegories and allusions 
with which they abound, which are ca- 
pable of different interpretations; though 
their doctrine concerning the creation 
of the world by one or more inferior 
beings of an evil or imperfect nature, 
led them to deny the divine authority of 
the books of the Old Testament, which 
contradicted this idle fiction, and filled 
them with an abhon-ence of Moses and 
the religion he taught ; alleging, that he 
was actuated by the malignant author of 
this world, who consulted his own glory 
and authority, and not the real advan- 
tage of men. Their persuasion that evil 
resided in matter, as its centre and 
source, made them treat the body with 
contempt, discourage marriage, and re- 
ject the doctrine ot the resurrection of 
the body, and its re-union with the im- 
mortal spirit. Their notion, that ma- 
levolent genii presided in nature, and 
occasioned diseases and calamities, wars 
and desolations, induced them to apply 
themselves to the study of magic, in 
order to weaken the powers, or suspend 
the influence of these malignant agents. 
The Gnostics considered Jesus Christ 
as the Son of God, and inferior to the 
Father, who came into the world for 
the rescue and happiness of miserable 
mortals, oppressed by matter and evil 
beings; but they rejected our Lord's 
humanity, on the principle that every 
thing corporeal is essentially and intrin- 
sically evil ; and thei-efore the greatest 
part of them denied the reality of his 
sufferings. They set a great \'alue on 
the beginning of the Gospel of St. John, 
where they fancied they saw a great 



deal of their xons, or emanations, under 
the terms the ivord, the life, the light, 
&amp;c. They divided all nature into three 
kinds of beings, viz. hylic, or material ; 
/isychic, or animal ; and /uieiimatic, or 
spiritual. On the like principle they 
also distinguished three sorts of men ; 
material, anivial, and ft/iirituat. The 
first, who were material, and incapable 
of knowledge, inevitably perished, both 
soul and body ; the third, such as the 
Gnostics themselves pretended to be, 
were all certainly saved; the psychic, 
or animal, who were the middle between 
the other two, were capable either of 
being saved or damned, according to 
their good or evil actions. With regard 
to their moral doctrines and conduct, 
they were much divided. The greatest 
part of this sect adopted very austere 
rules of life, recommended rigorous ab- 
stinence, and prescribed severe I)odily 
mortifications, with a view of purifying 
and exalting the mind. However, some 
maintained that there was no moral dif- 
ference in human actions ; and thus con- 
founding right with wrong, they gave a 
loose rein to all the passions, and assert- 
ed the innocence of following blindly all 
their motions, and of living by their tu- 
multuous dictates. They supported 
their opinions and practice by various 
authorities : some referred to fictitious 
and apocryphal writings of Adam, Abra- 
ham, Zoroaster, Christ, and his apos- 
tles ; others boasted that they had de- 
duced their sentiments from secret doc- 
trines of Christ, concealed from the vul- 
gar ; others affirmed that they arri^•ed 
at superior degrees of wisdom by an in- 
nate vigour of mind ; and others asserted 
that they were instructed in these mys- 
terious parts of theologicajb|cience by 
Theudas, a disciple*of Sttiflftl, and by 
Matthias, one of the frii^nds of our Lord, 
The tenets of the ancient Gnostics were 
revived in Spain, in the fourth centur)*, 
by a sect called the Priscillianists. At 
length the name Gnostic, which origi- 
nally was glorious, became infamous, by 
the idle opinions and dissolute lives of 
the persons who bore it. 

GOD, the self-existent, infinitely 
perfect, and infinitely good Being, who 
created and preserves all tilings tlia't 
have existence. As the Divine Being 
possesses a nature far beyond the com - 
prehension of any of his creatures, of 
course that nature is inexplicable. "All 
our knowledge of invisible ol)jects is ob- 
tained by analogy ; that is, bj the re- 
semljlance which they bear to visible 
objects ; but as there is in nature no ex- 
act resemblance of the nature of God, 
an attempt to explain the divine nature

is absurd and impracticable. All simi- 
litudes, therefore, which are used in at- 
tempting to explain it must be rejected." 
Yet, though we cannot fully understand 
his nature, there is something of him we 
may knov/. He hath been pleased to 
discover his perfections, in a measure, 
by the woi-ks of crciition and the Scrip- 
tures of truth ; these, therefore, we 
ought to study, in order that we may 
obtain the most V)ecoming thoughts of 
him. For an accoimt of the various at- 
tributes or perfections of God, the

There are various names given to the 
Almighty in the Scriptures, though pro- 

f)erly speaking, he can have no name ; 
or as he is incomprehensible, he is not 
nominable ; and being but one, he has 
no need of a name to distinguish him ; 
neveitheless, as names are gi\'en him in 
the Scriptures, to assist our ideas of his 
greatness and perfection, they are wor- 
thy of our consideration. These names 
are. El, which denotes him the strong 
and powerful (Jod, Gen. xvii. 1. Eloah, 
which represents him as the only proper 
object of worship, Psal. xlv. 6, 7. Shad- 
tlai, which denotes him to be all-suffi- 
cient and all-mighty, Exod. vi. 3. 
H/iccljon, AThich represents his incom- 
parable excellency, absolute supremacy 
over all, and his peculiar residence in 
the highest heavens, Psalm 1. 11. Adoni, 
which makes him the great connector, 
supporter, lord, and judge, of all crea- 
tures, Psal. ex. 1. Jail, which may de- 
note his self-existence, and giving of be- 
ing to his ci'eatures, or his inhnite come- 
liness, and answerableness to himself, 
and to the happiness of his creatures, 
Exod. XV. ^ Elijeh, I am, or I nvill be, 
denotes hi(PI^-exi3tence, absolute in- 
dependency, imputal^le eternity, and 
all-sufficiency, to his people, Exod. iii. 
14. Jehovah, which denotes his self- 
existence, absolute independence, un- 
successive eternity, and his effi?ctual and 
marvellous giving of being to his crea- 
tures, and fulfilling his promises. Gen. 
ii. 4, &amp;c. 

In the New Testament, God is called 
Kurios, or Lord, which denotes his 
self-existence, and his establishment of, 
and authorit)- over all things ; and Theos, 
which represents him as the maker, 
pen'ader, and governing observer of 
the vmiverse. 

GODFATHERS AND GODMO- 
THERS, persons who, at the baptism 
of infants, answer for their future con- 
duct, and solemnly promise that they 
will renounce the de\"il and all his 
works, and follow a life of piety and 



1 virtue ; and by these means lay them- 
' selves under an indispensable oblig'icion 
I to instruct them, and watch over their 
conduct. 

I GODLINESS, strictly taken, is right 
I worship or devotion ; but in general it 
j iniports the whole of practical religion, 
1 Tim . iv. 8. 2 Pet. i. 6. It is difficult, as 
Saurin observes, to include an adecjuate 
idea of it in what is called a definition. 
" It supposes knowledge, veneration, 
j affection, dependence, submission, grati- 
1 tude, and obedience ; or it may be re- 
I duced to these four ideas ; knoivledge 
' in the mind, by which it is distinguished 
from the visions of the superstitious ; 
rectitude in the conscience, that distin- 
guishes it from h}pocrisy ; sacrifice iu 
the life, or renunciation of the world, by 
which it is distinguished from the un- 
meaning obedience of him who goes as 
a happy constitution leads him ; and, 
lastly, zeal in the heart, which differs 
from the languishing emotions of the 
lukewarm." The advantages of this 
disposition, are honour, peace, safety, 
usefulness, support in death, and pros- 
pect of gloiy ; or, as the apostle sums 
up all in a few words, " It is profitable 
unto all things, having the promise of 
the life that now is, and of that which is 
to come," 1 Tim. iv. 8. Sauriii's Ser?n.

Works, vol. i. p. 9 ; Scott's Christian 
Life : ScougaWs Life of God in the Soul

GOOD, in general, is whatever in- 
creases pleasure, or diminishes pain in 
us ; or, which amounts to the same, 
whatever is able to procui'e or preserve 
to us the possession of agreeable sensa- 
tions, and remove those of an opposite 
nature. Moral good denotes the right 
conduct of the several senses and pas- 
sions, or their just proportion and ac- 
commodation to their respective objects 
and relations. 

Physical good is that which has either 
generally, or for any particular end, such 
qualities as are expected or desired. 

GOOD FRIDAY, a fast of the Chris- 
tian church, in memoiY of the sufferings 
and death of Jesus Christ. It is ob- 
served on the Friday in Passion Week, 
and it is called, by way of eminence, 
good ; because of the good effects of our 
Saviour's sufferings. Among the Sax- 
ons it was called Long Friday ; but for 
what reason does not ajipear, except on 
account of the long fasting and long of- 
fices then used. See Holy Days. 

GOODNESS, the fitness of a thing 
to produce any particular end. Per- 
fection, kindness, benevolence. 
GOODNESS OF GOD, relates to

the absolute perfection of his own na- 
ture, and his kindness manifested to his 
creatures. Goodness, says Dr. Gill, is 
essential to God, without which he 
■would not be God, Exod. xxxiii. 19. 
xxxiv. 6, 7. Goodness belongs only to 
God, he is solely good. Matt. xix. 17 ; 
and all the goodness found in creatures 
are only emanations of the divine good- 
ness. He is the chief good ; the sum 
and substance of all fclicitv, Ps. cxliv. 
12, 15. Ixxiii. 25. iv. 6, 7. There is no- 
thing but goodness in God, and nothing 
but goodness comes from him, 1 Jolin 
i. 5. James i. 13, 14. He is infinitely 
good ; finite minds cannot comprehend 
his goodness, Rom. xi. 35, 36. He is 
immutably and , unchangeably good, 
Zeph. iii. 17. The goodness of God is 
communicative and diffusive, Ps. cxix. 
68. xxxiii. 5. With respect to the ob- 
jects of it, it may be considered as ge- 
neral and special. His general good- 
ness is seen m all his creatures; yea in 
the inanimate creation, tb.e sun, tl;e 
earth, and all his works ; and in the go- 
vernment, support, and protection of the 
world at large, Ps. xxxvi. 6. cxlv. 
His special goodness relates to angels 
and saints. To angels, in creating, con- 
firming, and making them what they 
are. To saints, in election, calling, jus- 
tification, adoption, sanctification, per- 
severance, and eternal glorification.

GOSPEL, the revelation of the grace 
of God to fallen man thi-ough a media- 
tor. It is taken also for the history of 
the life, actions, death, resurrection, as- 
cension, and doctrine of Jesus Christ. 
The word is Saxon, and of the same 
import with the Latin ex&lt;angelium, 
which signifies glad tidings or good 
news. It is called the (ios/iel of his 
Grace, because it flows from his free 
love, Acts XX. 24. The Gos/tel of the 
kingdom, as it treats of the kingdoms of 
grace and glory. The Gos/icl of Christ, 
because he is the author and subject of 
it, Rom. i. 16. The Gosjiel of peace 
and salvation, as it promotes our pre- 
sent comfort, and leads to eternal glorv, 
Eph. i. 13. vi. 15. The glorious Gospel, 
as in it the glorious perfections of Jelio- 
vah are displayed, 2 Cor. iv. 4. The 
everlasting Gospel, as it was designed 
from eternity, is permanent in time, and 
the effects of it eternal, Rev. xiv. 6. 
There are about thirty or forty apociy- 
phal Gospels ; as the Gospel of St. Pe- 



ter, of St. Andrew, of St. Barnabas, tlie 
eternal Gospel, Sec. &amp;c. &amp;c. : but they 
were never received by the Christian 
church, being evidently fabulous and 
trifling. See Christianity. 

GOSPEL CALL. See Calling. 

GOSPEL A LAW. It has been 
disputed whether the Gospel consists 
merely of pi-omises, or whether it can 
in any sense be called a law. The an- 
swer plainly depends upon adjusting 
the meaning of tne words Gospel and 
lavj : if the Gospel be taken for the de- 
claration God has made to men by 
Christ, concerning the manner in which 
he will ti-eat them, and the conduct he 
expects from them, it is plain that this 
includes commands, and even threat- 
enings, as Well as promises ; but to de- 
fine the Gospel so, as only to express 
the fa\'ourai)le part of that declaration, 
is indeed taking the question for grant- 
ed, and confining the word to a sense 
much less extensive than it often has in 
Scripture : compare Rom. ii. 16. 2 
Thes. i. 8. 1 Tim. i. 10, 11.; and it is 
certain, that, if the Gospel be put for 
all the parts of the dispensation taken 
in connection one with another, it may 
well be called, on the whole, a good 
message. In like manner the question, 
wliether the Gospel be a law or not, i.s 
to be determined bv the definition of 
the law and of the Gospel, as above. If 
law signifies, as it generally does, the 
discovery of the will of a superior, 
teaching what he requires of those un- 
der his government, with the intimation 
of his intention of dispensing rewards 
and punishments, as this rule of their 
conduct is observed or neglected; iji this 
latitude of expi'ession, it is plain, from 
the proposition, that the Gospel, taken 
for the declaration made to men by 
Christ, is a lanv, as in Scripture it is 
sometimes called, James i. 25. Rom. iv, 
15. Rom. viii. 2. But if law be taken, 
in the greatest rigour of the expression, 
for such a discovery of the will of God, 
and our duty, as to contain in it no inti- 
mation of our obtaining the Divine fa- 
vour otherwise than by a perfect and 
universal conformity to it, in that sense 
' the Gospel is not a law. See Neono- 
iNiiANS. IVitsius 071 Cov. vol. iii. ch. 1. ; 
Doddridge's Lect. lect. 172.; Watts's 
Orthodoxy and Charitii, essay 2. 

GOVERNMENT OF GOD, is the 
disposal of liis creatures, and all events 
relative to them, according to his infi- 
nite justice, power, and wisdom. His 
moral government is his rendering to 
every man according to his actions, con- 
sidei-ed as good or evil. See DoMiMlOK

GRA

GRA 



GRACE. Tliere are various senses 
in which tliis word is vistd in Scripture ; 
but the general idea of it, as it relates 
to God, is his free favour and love. As 
it respects men, it implies the happy 
state of reconciliation and fa\'our with 
God wherein they stand, and the holy 
endowments, qualities, or habits of 
faith, hope, love, Sec, which they pos- 
sess. Divines have distinguished grace 
into common or general, fipecial or par- 
ticular. Commo?i grace, if it may be so 
called, is what all men have ; as the 
light of nature and reason, convictions 
of conscience, &amp;c., Rom. ii. 4. 1 Tim. iv. 
10. Special grace is that Avhich is pe- 
culiar to some people only ; such as 
electing, redeeming, justifying, pardon- 
ing, adopting, establishing, and sanctify- 
ing grace, Rom. viii. 30. This special 
grace is by some distinguished into im- 
puted and inherent: imputed grace 
consists in tlie holiness, obedience, and 
righteousness of Christ, imputed to us 
for our justification ; inherent grace is 
what is w^'ought in the heart by the Spi- 
rit of God in regeneration. Grace is 
also said to be irresistible, efficacious, 
and victorious; not but that thei'e are in 
human nature, in the fiist moments of 
conviction, some* stiuggles, opposition, 
or conflict ; but by these terms we are 
to understand, that, in the end, victory 
declares for the grace of the Gospel. 
There have been many other di.stmc- 
tions of grace; but as they are of too 
frivolous a nature, and are now obsolete, 
they need not a place here. Growt/i in 
grace is the progress we make in the di- 
vine life. It discovers itself by an in- 
crease of spiritual light and knowledge; 
by olir renouncing self, and dej^ending 
more ui)on Ghrist; by growing more 
spiritual in duties ; by being more lium- 
ble, submissive, and thankful ; by rising 
superior to the corruptions of our nature, 
and finding the power of sin more weak- 
ened in us; by being less attached to the 
world, and possessing more of a hea- 
venly disposition. M'Luurin's Essays,

GRACE AT MEALlS, a short pray- 
er, imploring the divine blessing on our 
food, and expressive of gratitude to God 
for supplying our necessities. The pro- 
priety of this act is evident from the 
divine command, 1 Thess. v. 18. 1 Cor. 
X. 31. 1 Tim. iv. 5. From the conduct 
of Christ, Mark viii. 6, 7. From rea- 
son itself; not to mention that it is a 
custom practised by most nations, and 



even not neglected by heathens them- 
selves. The English, however, seem 
to be very deficient in this duty. 

As to the mcuuier in which it ought to 
be performed, as Dr. Watts observes, 
we ought to have a due regard to the 
occasion, and the persons present ; the 
neglect of which hath been attended 
with indecencies and indiscretions. Some 
have used themselves to mutter a few 
words with so low a voice, as though by 
some secret charm they were to conse- 
crate the food alone, aiid there was no 
need of the rest to join with them in the 
petitions. Others have broke out into 
so violent a sound, as though they were 
bound to make a thousand people hear 
them. Some perform this part of woi'- 
ship with so slight and familiar an air, 
as though they had no sense of the great 
God to whom they speak : others have 
put on an iinnatural solemnity, and 
changed their natural voice into so dif- 
ferent and awkward a tone, not without 
some distortions of countenance, that 
have tempted strangers to ridicule. 

It is the custom of some to hurry over 
a single sentence or two, and they ha^'c 
done, before half the company- are pre- 
pared to lift up a thought to heaven. 
And some have lieen just heard to be- 
speak a blessing on the church and the 
king, but seem to have forgot they were ■ 
asknig God to Ijless their food, or giving 
thanks for the food they have received. 
Others, again, make a long prayer, and, 
among a multitude of other petitions, do 
not utter one that relates to the table 
before them. 

'llie general rules of pnidence, toge- 
ther with a due observation of the cus- 
tom of the place where we live, would 
correct all these disorders, and teach us 
that a few sentences suited to the occa- 
sion, spoken with an audible and proper 
voice, are suflicient for this purpose, es- 
pecially if any strangers are pi-esent.

GRATITUDE, is that pleasant af- 
fection of the' mind which arises from a 
sense of favours received, and by Avhich 
the possessor is excited to make all the 
returns of love and service in his power. 
"Gratitude," says Mr. Cogan (in his 
Treatise on the Passions,) "is the 
powerful re-action of a well-disposed 
mind, upon whom benevolence has con- 
ferred some importaiit good. It is most- 
ly connected with an impi-essive sense 
of the amiable disposition of the person 
by whom the benefit is conferred, and it 
immediately produces a personal aflPec- 
tion towards him. ^Ve shall not wonder

at the peculiar strength and energy of 
this afiFection, when we consider that it 
is compounded of love placed upon the 
good communicated, affection tor the 
donor, and joy at the reception. Thus 
it has goodness for its object, and the 
most pleasing, perhaps uiiexfiected, ex- 
ei*tions of goodness for its immediate 
cause. T/uinkfiilness refers to verbal 
expressions of "gratitude." See Thank- 
fulness. 

GRAVITY, is that seriousness of 
mind, united with dignity of behaviour, 
that commands veneration and respect.

GREATNESS OF GOD, is the in- 
finite glory and excellency of all his 
perfections. His greatness appears by

self, and not derived, Ps. xxi. 13. it is 
infinite, Ps. cxlv. 3. not diminished by

GREEK CHURCH, comprehends in 
its bosom a considerable part of Greece, 
the Grecian Isles, Wallachia, Molda- 
via, Egypt, Abyssinia, Nubia, Libya, 
Arabia, Niesopotamia, Syria, Cilicia, 
and Palestine, which are all under the 
jurisdiction of the patriarchs of Constan- 
tinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jeru- 
salem. If to these we add the whole of 
the Russian empire in Europe, great 
part of Siberia in Asia, Astracan, Casan, 
and Geoi-gia, it will be evident that the 
(ireek church has a wider extent of 
territory than the Latin, with all the 
branches which have sprung from it ; 
and that it is witli great impropriety 
that the church of Rome is called by 
her members the catholic or universal 
churcli. That in these widely distant 
countries the professors of Christianity 
are_ agreed in every minute article of 
belief, it would be rash to assert ; but 
there is certainly such an agreement 
among them, with respect both to faith 
and to discipline, tliat they mutually 
hold communion with each other, and 



are, in fact, but one church. It is called 
the Greek church, in contradistinction 
to tl\e Latin or Romish church ; as also 
th% Eastern, in distinction from the 
W'estern church. We shall here pre- 
sent the reader with a view of its rise, 
tenets, and discipline. 

1. Greek church, rise arid sefiaratioii 
of. The Greek chui-ch is considered as 
a separation from the Latin. In the 
middle of the ninth century, the con- 
troversy relating to the procession of the 
Holy Ghost (which had been started in 
the sixth century) became a point of 
great importance, on account of the jea- 
lousy and ambition which at that time 
were blended with it. Photius, the pa- 
triarch of Jerusalem, having been ad- 
vanced to that see in the room of Igna- 
tius, whom he procured to be deposed, 
was solemnly excommunicated by pope 
Nicholas, in a council held at Rome, 
and his ordination declared null and 
void. The Greek Einperor resented 
tiiis conduct of the pope, who defended 
himself with great spirit and resolution. 
Photius, in his tui'n, convened what he 
called an oecumenical council, in which 
he pi-onounced sentence of excommuni- 
cation and deposition against the pope, 
and got it subscribed by twenty-one 
bishops and others, amounting in num- 
ber to a thousand. This occasioned a 
wide breach between the sees of Rome 
and Constantinople. However, the death 
of the emperor Michael, and the depo- 
sition of Photius, subsequent thereupon, 
seem to have restored peace ; for the 
emperor Basil held a council at Con- 
stantinople in the year 869, in which 
entire satisfaction was given to Pope 
Adrian ; but the schism was only smo- 
thered and suppressed a while. The 
Greek church had several complaints 
against the Latin; particularly it was 
thought a gi-eat hardship for the Greeks 
to subscribe to the definition of a coun- 
cil according to the Roman form, pre- 
scribed by the pope, since it made the 
church of Constantinople dependent on 
that of "Rome, and set the pope above 
an oecumenical council ; but, aoove all, 
the pride and haughtiness of the Roman 
court gave the Greeks a great distaste ; 
and as their deportment seemed to in- 
sult his imperial majesty, it entirely 
alienated the affections of the ernpcror 
Basil. Towards the middle of the ele- 
venth century, Michael Cei'ularius, ])a- 
triarch of Constantinople, opposed the 
Latins, with respect to their making use 
of unleavened bread in the eucharist, 
their observation of the sabbath, and 
fasting on Saturday, charging them with 
living in communioii with the Jews. To

this pope Leo IX. replied ; and, in his 
apologv for the Latins, declaimed very 
warmly against the false doctrine of the 
Greeks, and interposed at the^saine 
time, the authority of his see. He like- 
wise, by his legates, excommunicated 
the patriarch in the church of Santa 
Sophia, which gave the last shock to the 
reconciliation attempted a long time af- 
ter, but to no purpose ; for from that 
time the hatred of the Cireeks to the 
Latins, and of the Latins to the Greeks, 
became insuperable, insomuch that they 
liave continued ever since separated 
from each other's communion. 

n. Greek church, tenets of. The fol- 
lowing are some of the chief tenets held 
by the Greek chui'ch : — They disown 
the authority of the pope, and deny that 
the church of Rome is the true catholic 
church. They do not baptize their chil- 
dren till they are three, four, live, six, 
ten, nay, sometimes eighteen years of 
age : baptism is performed by tnne im- 
mersion. They insist that the sacra- 
ment of the Lord's supper ought to be 
administered in botli kinds, and they 
give the sacrament to children imme- 
diately after baptism. They grant no 
indulgences, nor do they lay any claim 
to the character of infaUibiiity, like the 
church of Rome. They deny that there 
is any such place as purgatory ; notwith- 
standing they pray for the dead, that 
God would haAe mercy on them at the 
general judgment. They practise the 
invocation of saints ; though, they say, 
they do not invoke them as deities, but 
as intercessors with God. They ex- 
clude confirmation, extreme unction, 
and matrimony, out of the seven sacra- 
ments. They deny auricular confession 
to be a divine precept, and saj'^ it is only 
a positive injunction of the church. 
They pay no religious homage to the 
eucharist. They admyiister the com- 
munion in both kinds to the laity, both 
in sickness and in health, though they 
have never applied themselves to their 
confessors; because they are persuaded 
that a lively faith is all whicli is'requi- 
site for the worthy receiving of the 
Lord's supper. Tliey maintain tliat the 
Hoi 5' Ghost proceeds only from the Fa- 
ther, and not from the Son. They be- 
lieve in predestination. They admit of 
no images in ivlief or embossed work, 
but use paintings and sculptures in cop- 
per or silvei". They approve of the mar- 
riage of priests, provided they enter in- 
to that state before their admission into 
holy orders. They condemn all fourth 
marriages. They observe a number of 
hiojy davs, and keep four fasts in the 
year more solemn than the rest, of 



which the fast in Lent, before Easter, 
is the chief. They believe the doctrine 
of consubstantiation, or the union of the 
body of Christ with the sacrament bread. 

III. Greek church, state and discipline 
of. Since the Greeks became subject to 
the Turkish yoke, they have sunk into 
the most deplorable ignorance, in con- 
sequence of the slavery and thraldom 
under which they groan ; and their re- 
ligion is now greatly cori-upted. It is, 
indeed, little better than a neap of ridi- 
culous ceremonies and absurdities. The 
head of the Greek church is the patri- 
arch of Constantinople, who is chosen 
by the neighbouring archbishops and 
metropolitans, and confirmed by the 
emperor or grand vizier. He is a per- 
son of great dignity, being the head and 
director of the Eastern church. The 
other patriarchs are those of Jenisalem, 
Antioch, and Alexandria. Mr. Toume- 
fort tells us, that the patriarchates are 
now generally set to sale, and bestowed 
\ipon those who are the highest bidders. 
'1 he patriarchs, metropolitans, arch- 
bishops, and bishops, are always chosen 
from among the caloyers, or Greek 
monks. The next person to a bishop, 
among the clergy, is an archimandrite, 
who is the director of one or more con- 
vents, which are called mandren ; then 
comes the abbot, the arch-priest, the 
priest, the deacon, the under-deacon, 
the chanter, and the lecturer. The se- 
cular clergy are subject to no niles, and 
never rise higher than high-priest. The 
Greeks \\a.\e few nunneries, but a great 
many convents of monks, who are all 
priests; and (students excepted) obli- 
ged to follow some handicraft employ- 
ment, and lead a very austere life. 

The Russians adhere to the doctrine 
and ceremonies of the Greek church, 
though they are now independent of the 
patriarch of Constantinople. The Rus- 
sian church, indeed, may be reckoned 
the first, as to extent of empire; yet 
there is veiy little of the power of vital 
religion among them. The Roskolniki, 
or, as they now call themselves, the 
Starovertzi, were a sect that separated 
from the church of Russia, about 1666 : 
they affected extraordinary piety and 
devotion, a ^'eneration for the letter of 
the Holy Scriptures, and would not al- 
low a priest to administer baptism who 
had that day tasted brandy. They har- 
boured many follies and superstitions, 
and have been greatly pei'secuted ; but, 
perhaps, tiiere will be found among 
them "som.e that shall be counted to 
the Lord for a generation." Several set- 
tlements of German Protestants have 
been established in the Wolga. The

Grace. 

GUARDIAN ANGEL. "Some," 
says Dr. Doddridge, "have thought, 
that not only every region but every 
Tnun has some particular angel assigned 
him as a guardian, whose business it is 
generally to watch over that country or 
person ; for this opinion they urge Matt. 
xvii). 10. Acts xii. 15. But the argument 
from both these places is evidently pre- 
carious ; and it seems difficult to recon- 
cile th^ supposition of such a continued 



attendance with what is said of the sta- 
ted residence of these angels in heaven, 
and with Heb. i. 14, where all the an- 
gels are represented as ministering to 
the heirs of salvation : though, as there 
is great I'eason to believe the number of 
heavenly spirits is vastly superior to 
that of men upon earth, it is not impro- 
bable that they may, as it were, relieve 
each other, and. in their turns perform 
tliese condescending services to those 
whom the Lord ot Angels has been 
pleased to redeem with his own blood; 
but we must confess that our knowledge 
of the laws and orders of those celestial 
beings is very limited, and consequently 
that it is the part of humility to avoid 
dogmatical determinations on such heads 
as these." See Angel ; and Dod- 
dridge's Lectures, lect. 212. 

GUILT, the state of a person justly 
charged with a crime ; a consciousness 
of having done amiss. See Sin. 



H. 



HABIT, a power and ability of doing 
any thing, acquired by fremient repeti- 
tion of the same action. It is distin- 
guished from custom. Custom respects 
t\\e actioji ; habit the arto?-. 'Ry custom 
we mean a frequent reiteration of the 
same act ; and by habit the effect that 
custom has on the mind or body. " Man," 
as one observes, "is a bundle of habits. 
There are habits of industry, attention, 
vigilance, advertency ; of a prompt obe- 
dience to the judgment occurring, or of 
yielding to the first impulse of passion ; 
of apprehending, methodizing, reason- 
ing ; of vanity, melancholy, fretfulness, 
suspicion, covetousness, &amp;c. In a word, 
there is not a quality or function, either 
of body or mind, which does not feel the 
influence of this great laAV of animated 
nature." To cure evil habits, we should 
be as early as we can in our application, 
princi/iiis obsta ; to cross and mortify 
the incluiation by a frequent and obsti- 
nate practice of the contrary virtue. To 
foi-m good habits, we should get our 
minds well stored with knowledge ; as- 
sociate with the wisest and best men ; 
reflect much on the pleasure good ha- 
bits are productive of; and, above all, 
supplicate the Divine Being for direc- 
tion and assistance. Kaims's Elem. of

fi/ERETICO COMBURENDO, a 
writ which anciently lay against an he- 
retic, who, having once been convicted 
of heresy by his bishop, and having ab- 
jured it, afterwards falling into it again, 
or into some other, is thereupon com- 
mitted to the secular power. This writ 
is thought by some to be as ancient as 
the common law itself ; however, the 
conviction of heresy by the common law 
was not in any petty ecclesiastical court, 
but before the archbishop himself, in a 
provincial synod, and the delinquent was 
delivered up to the king, to do with 
him as he pleased ; so that the crown 
had a control over the spiritual power: 
but by 2 Henry IV. cap. 15. the dioce- 
san alone, without the intei'vention of a 
synod, might convict of heretical tenets; 
and unless the convict abjured his opi- 
nions, or if after abjuration he relapsed, 
the sheriff" was bound ex officio, if requi- 
red by the bishop, to commit the unhap- 
py victim to the flames, without waiting 
tor the consent of the crown. This writ 
remained in force, and was actually 
executed on two Anabaptists, in the se- 
venth of Elizabeth, and on two Arians 
in the ninth of James I. Sir Edward 
Coke was of opinion that this writ did 
not lie in his time ; but it is now formally 
taken away b}' statute 29 Car. II. cap. 9.

But this statute does not extend to take 
away or abridge the jurisdiction of Pro- 
testant archbishops, or bishops, or any 
other judges of any ecclesiastical courts, 
in cases of atheism, blasphemy, heresy, 
or schism ; but they may prove and 
punish the same, according to his ma-

munication, deprivation, degradation, 
and other ecclesiastical censures, not 
extending to death, in such sort, and no 
other, as they might have done before

HAMPTON-COURT CONFER- 
ENCE, a conference appointed by 
James I. at Hampton-Court, in 1603, in 
order to settle the disputes Ijetween the 
church ?.nd the Puritans. Nine bishops, 
and as many dignitaries of the church, 
appeared on one side, and four Puritan 
ministers on the other. It lasted for 
three days. Neale calls it a mock con- 
ference, because all things were pre- 
viouslv concluded between the king and 
the bishops; and the Puritans borne 
down not with calm reason and argu- 
ment, but with the royal authority, the 
king being both judge and party. The 
proposals and remonstrances of the Pu- 
litans may be seen in A''eah'''s History

■ HAPPINESS, absolutely taken, de- 
notes the durable possession of perfect 
good, without any mixtvire of evil ; or 
vhe enjoyment of pure pleasure unalloy- 
ed with pain, or a state in which all our 
wishes are satisfied ; in which senses, 
happiness is only known by name on 
tliis earth. The word hajipy, when ap- 
plied to any state or condition of human 
life, will admit of no positive definition, 
but is merely a relative term ; that is, 
when we call a man happy, we mean 
that he is happier than some others with 
whom we compare him ; than the gene- 
rality of others ; or than he himself was 
\\\ some other situation. Moralists justly 
t^serve, that happiness does not consist 
in the pleasures of sense; as eating, 
drinking, music, painting, theatric ex- 
hibitions, 6cc. &amp;c. for these pleasures 
continue but a little while, by repetition 
lose then* i-elish, and by high expecta- 
tion often bring disappointment. Nor 
does happiness consist in an exemption 
from labour, cai'e, business, &amp;c. ; such a 
state being usually attended with de- 
pression ot spirits, imaginary anxieties, 
and the whole train of hypochondriacal 
affections. Nor is it to be found in great- 
ness, rank, or elevated statiop.s, as mat- 



ter of fact abundantly testifies; but hap- 
piness consists in the enjoyment of the 
divine favour, a good conscience, and 
uniform conduct. In subordination to 
these, human happiness may be greatly 
promoted by the exercise of the social 
affections ; the pursuit of some engaging 
end ; the prudent constitution of the ha- 
bits ; and the enjoyment of our health.

HARMONY OF THE GOSPELS, 
a term made use of to denote the con- 
currence or agreement of the writings 
of the four Evangelists ; or the history 
of the four Evangelists digested into one 
continued series. By this means each 
story or discourse is exhibited with all 
its concurrent circumstances; frequent 
repetitions are pi-evented, and a multi- 
tude of seeming oppositions reconciled. 
Among some of the most valuable har- 
monies, are those of Cradock, Le Clerc, 
Doddridge, Mackuight, A''ewcombe, and 
Townson's able Harmony on the con- 
cluding Part of the Gospels; Thomp- 
son's Diatessaron. The teimi harmony 
is also used in reference to the agree- 
ment which the Gospel beai'S to natural 
religion, the Old Testament, the histo- 
ry of other nations, and the works of 
God at large. 

HASSIDEANS, or Assideans, 
those Jews who resorted to Mattathias, 
to fight for the laws of God and the 
li1)erties of their country. They were 
men of great valour and zeal, having 
voluntarily devoted themselves to a 
more strict observation of the law than 
other men. For, after the return of the 
Jews from the Babylonish captivity, 
there were two sorts of men in their 
church ; those who contented them- 
selves with that obedience only which 
was prescribed by the law of Moses, 
and who were called Zadikin, i. e. the 
righteous ; and those who, over and 
above the laws, superadded the consti- 
tutions and traditions of the elders, and 
other rigorous observances ; these lat- 
ter Avere called the Chasidim, i. e. the 
pious. From the former sprang the 
Samaritans, Sadducees, and Caraites : 
•from the latter, the Pharisees and the 
Essenes ; which see. 

HATRED is the aversion of the will 
to any object considered by us as evil, 
or to' any person or thing we suppose 
can do us harm. See Antipathy. Ha- 
tred is ascribed to God, but is not to be 
considered as a passion in him as in

man ; nor can he hate any of the crea- 
tures he has made as his creatures. Yet 
he is said to hate the wicked, Ps. v. 5 ; 
and indignation and wrath, tribulation 
and anguish, will be upon every soul of 
man that does evil. See Wrath of 
God. 

H ATTEMISTS, in ecclesiastical his- 
tory, the name of a modern Dutch sect, 
so called from Pontian Van Hattem, a 
minister in the province of Zealand, to- 
wards the close of the last centun% who, 
being addicted to the sentiments of Spi- 
nosa, was on that account degraded from 
his pastoral office. The Verschorists 
and Hattemists resemble eacli other in 
their religious sj^stems, though they 
never so entirely agreed as to form one 
communion. The founders of these sects 
deduced from the doctrine of absolute 
deci'ees a system of fatal and uncontrol- 
lable necessity ; they denied the differ- 
ence between moral good and evil, and 
the corruption of human nature ; from 
whence they farther concluded, that 
mankind were under no sort of obliga- 
tion to correct their manners, to im- 
J)rove their minds, or to obey the divine 
aws ; that the whole of religion consist- 
ed not in acting, but in suffering; and 
that all the precepts of Jesus Christ are 
reducible to this one, that ive bear with 
chcfrfulness and fiatience the events 
that happen to un through the divine 
will, and make it our constant and only 
study to maintain a permanent tran- 
quillity of mi7id. Thus far they agi-eed : 
nut the Hattemists further affirmed, 
that Christ made no expiation for the 
sins of men by his deatli ; but had only 
suggested to us, by his mediation, that 
there wasnothing in us that could offend 
the Deity : this, they say, was Christ's 
manner of justifying his servants, and 
presenting them blameless before the 
triljunal of God. It was one of their dis- 
tinguished tenets, that God does not 
punish men for their sins, but by their 
sins. These two sects, says Mosheim, 
still subsist, though the)' no longer bear 
the names of then- fovmders. 

HEARING THEWORD OF GOD, 
is an ordinance of divine appointment, 
Rom. X. 17. Prov. viii. 4, 5. Mark iv. 24. 

Public reading of the Scriptures was 
a part of synagogue worship. Acts xiii. 
15. Acts XV. 21. and was the practice of 
the Christians in primitive times. Un- 
der the former dispensation there was a 
public hearing of the law at stated sea- 
sons, Dent. xxxi. 10, 13. Neh. viii. 2, 3. 
It seems, therefore, that it is a duty in- 
cumbent on us to hear, and, if sensible 
of our ignorance, we shall also consider 
it our privilege. As to the manner of \ 



hearing, it should be constantly, Proy, 
viii. 34. Jam. i. 24, 25. Jttentively, Luke 
xxi. 38. Acts x. 33. Luke iv. 20, 22. 
With rex'erence, Ps. Ixxxix. 7. With 
faith, Heb iv. 2. With an endeavour to 
retain what we hear, Heb. ii. 1. Ps. cxix.

HEART is used for the soul, and all 
the powers thereof; as the understand- 
ing, conscience, will, affections, and me- 
mory. The heart of man is naturally, 
constantly, universally, inexpressibly, 
o])enly, and evidently depraved, and in- 
clined to evil, Jer. xvii. 9. It requires a 
divine power to renovate it, and render 
it susceptible of right impressions, Jer. 
xxiv. 7. ^^'hen thus renovated, the ef- 
fects will be seen in the temper, conver- 
sation, and conduct at large. See Faith, 
Hope, 6cc. Hardness of heart is that 
state in which a sinner is inclined to, 
and actually goes on in rebellion against 
God. This state evidences itself bv light 
views of the evil of sin ; partial acknow- 
ledgment and confession of it; frequent 
commission of it ; pride and conceit : in- 
gratitude ; unconceiTi about the word 
and ordinances of God ; inattention to 
divine providences; stifling convictions 
of conscience; shunning reproof; pre- 
sumption, and general ignorance of^ di- 
vine things. W e must distinguish, how- 
ever, between that hardness of heart 
which even a good man complains of, 
and that of a judicial nature. 1. Judi- 
cial hai'dness is verj- seldom perceived, 
and never lamented ; a broken and con- 
trite heart is the least thing such desire ; 
but it is otherwise with believers, for 
the hardness they feel is always a mat- 
ter of grief to them, Rom. vii. 24. — 2. Ju- 
dicial hardness is perpetual ; or, if ever 
there be any remorse or relenting, it is 
only at such times when the sinner is 
under some outward afflictions, or filled 
with the dread of the wrath of God ; 
but as this wears off or abates, his stu- 
pidity returns as much or more tliati 
ever, Exod. ix. 27 ; but tnie believers, 
when no adverse dispensations trouble 
them, are often distressed because their 
hearts are no more affected in lioly du- 
ties, or inflamed with love to God, Rom. 
vii. 15. — 3. Judicial hardness is attended 
with a total neglect of duties, especially 



HEA 



2QS 



HEA 



those that are secret ; but that hai'dness 
of heart which a believer complains of, 
though it occasions his going uncomfor- 
tably in duty, vet does not keep him 
from it. Job xxiii. 2, 3. — 4. When a per- 
son is judicially hai'dened, he makes 
use of indirect and unwarrantable me- 
thods to maintain that false peace which 
he thinks himself happy in^ the enjoy- 
ment of; but a believer, when complain- 
ing of the hardness of his heart, cannot 
be satisfied with any thing short of 
Christ, Ps. ci. 2. — 5. Judicial hardness 
generally opposes the interest of truth 
and godliness; but a good man considers 
this as a cause neai-est his heart; and 
although he have to lament his luke- 
■warmness, yet he constantly desires to 
promote it, Ps. Ixxii. 19. 

Kecliing the heart, is a duty enjoined 
in the sacred Scriptures. It consists, 
says Mr. Flavel, in the diligent and con- 
stant use and improvement of all holy 
means and duties to preserve the soul 
from sin, and maintain communion with 
God ; and this, he properlv observes, 
supposes a previous work of sanctifica- 
tion, which hath set the heart right by 
giving it a new bent and inclination. 

1. It includes frequent observation of 
the frame of the heart, Ps. Ixxvii. 6. — 

2. Deep humiliation for heart evils and 
disorders, 2 Chi-on. xxxii. 26. — 3. Ear- 
nest supplication for heart purifying and 
rectifying ^race, Ps. xix. 12. — 4. A con- 
stant holy jealousy over our hearts, 
Prov. xxvii. 14. — 5. It includes the real- 
izing of God's presence with us, and set- 
ting him before us, Ps. xvi. 8. Gen. xvii. 
1. This is, 1. The hardest work; heart 
work is hard work, indeed. — 2. Constant 
work, Exod. xvii. 12. — 3. The most im- 
portant work, Prov. xxiii. 26. This is a 
duty ivhich should be attended to, iftve 
consider it in connectioii with, 1. The 
honour of God, Is. Ixvi. 3.-r-2. The sin- 
cerity of our profession, 2 Kings x. 31. 
Ezek. xxxiii. 31, 32. — 3. The beauty of 
our conversation, Prov. xii. 26. Ps. xlv. 
1. — 4. The comfort of our souls, 2 Cor. 
xiii. 5. — 5. The improvement of our 
graces, Ps. Ixiii. 5, 6. — 6. The stability 
of our souls in tlie liour of temptation, 1 
Cor. xvi. 13. — Tlie seasons in which we 
should more fiarticularly keep our hearts 
are, 1. The time of prosperitv, Deut. vi. 
10, 12.— 2. Under afflictions, Heb. vii. 5, 
6. — 3. The time of Sion's troubles, Ps. 
xlvi. 1, 4. — 4. In the time of great and 
threatened dangers. Is. xxvi. 20, 21. — 

5. Under great wants, Phil. iv. 6, 7. —

HEATHEN, pagans who worship 
false gods, and are not acquainted 
either with the doctnnes of the Old 
Testament or the Christian dispensa- 
tion. For many ages before Christ, the 
nations at large were destitute of the 
true religion, and gave themselves up 
to the grossest ignorance, the most ab- 
surd idolatry, and the greatest crimes. 
Even the most learned men among the 
heathens were in general inconsistent, 
and complied with or promoted the 
vain customs they found among their 
countrymen. It was, however, divinely 
foretold, that in Abraham's seed all 
nations should be blessed ; that the hea- 
then should be gathered to the Saviour, 
and become his people. Gen. xxii, 18, 
Gen. xlix. 10. Ps. ii. 8. Isa. xiii. 6, 7, 
Ps. Ixxii, Isaiah Ix, In order that these 
promises might be accomplished, vast 
numbers of the Jews, after the Chal- 
dean captivity, were left scattered 
among the heathen. The Old Testa- 
ment was translated into Greek, the 
most common language of the heathen; 
and a rumour of the Saviour's appear- 
ance in the flesh was spread far and wide 
among them. When Christ came, he 
preached chiefly in Galilee, whei-e there 
were multitudes of Gentiles. He as- 
sured the Greeks that vast numbers of 
the heathen should be brought into the 
church. Matt. iv. 23. John xii. 20, 24, 
For 1700 years past the Jews have been 
generally rejected, and the church of 
God has been composed of the Gen- 
tiles, Upwards of 480 millions (nearly 
half the globe,) however, are su[)posed 
to be yet m pagan darkness. Consider- 
able attempts have been made of late 
years for the enlightening of the' hea- 
then ; and there is every reason to be- 
lieve good has been done. From the 
aspect of Scripture prophecy, we are 
led to expect that the kingdoms of the 
heathen at large shall he brought to the 
light of the Gospel, Matt. xxiv. 14. Isa. 
Ix. Ps. xxii. 28, 29. Ps. ii. 7, 8. It has 
been much disputed whether it be pos- 
sil)le that the heathen should be saved

SQTne have absolutely denied it, upon 
the authority of those texts wliich uni- 
versally require faith in Christ ; but to 
this it IS "answered, that those texts re- 
gard only such to whom the Gospel 
comes, and are capaljle of understand- 
ing the contents ot it. The truth, says 
Dr. Doddridge, seems to be this ; that 
none of the heathens will be condemned 
for not believing the Gospel, but they 
are liable to condemnation for tlie 
breach of God's natural law : neverthe- 
less, if thei'e be any of them in whom 
there is a prevailing lo^'e to the Divine 
BeiiTg, there seems reason to believe 
that, for the sake of Christ, though to 
them unknown, they may be accepted 
by God ; and so much the rather, as 
the ancient Jews, and even the apos- 
tles, during the time of o\ir Saviour's 
abode on earth, seem to have had but 
little notion of those doctrines, which 
those who deny the salvability of the 
heathens are most apt to imagine, Rom. 
ii. 10 — 22. Acts x. 34, 35. 'Matt. viii. 
11, 12. Ml-. Gro\-e, Dr. \\'atts, Sau- 
rin, and Mr. Newton, favour the same 
opinion ; tlie latter of whom tlius ob- 
serves: "If we suijpose a lieathen 
brought to a sense of his misery ; to a 
conviction that he cannot be liappy 
•without the favour of the great Lord of 
the world ; to a feeling of giiilt, and 
desire of mercy, and that, though he 
has no explicit knowledge of a Saviour, 
he directs tlie cry of his heart to the 
unknown Supreme, to have mercy upon 
him ; who will prove that such ^-iews 
and desires can arise in the heart of a 
sinner, without the energy of that S]5i- 
rit which Jesus is exalted to bestow ? 
Who will take upon him to sav, that 
his blood has not sufficient efficacv to 
redeem to God a sinner who is tlius 
disposed, thougli he have never heard 
of his name ? Or who lias a warrant to 
affirm, that the supposition I have made 
is in tlie nature of things impossible to 
be realized?" A'ew ton's Messiah; Dr.

HEAVEN is considered as a place 
in some remote part of infinite space, 
in which the omnipresent Deity is said 
to afford a nearer and moi'e immediate 
view of himself, atid a more sensible 



manifestation of his glory, than in the 
other parts of the universe. 

That there is a state of future hajipi" 
ness, both reason and Scripture indi- 
cate ; a general notion of happiness 
after death has obtained among the 
wiser sort of heathens, who have only 
had the light of nature to guide them. 
If we examine the human mind, it is 
also evident that there is a natural de- 
sire after happiness in all men ; and, 
which is equally evident, is not attained 
in this life. It is no less observable, 
that in the ])resent state there is an 
unequal distribution of things, which 
makes the providences of God very in- 
tricate, and which cannot be solved 
without supposing a future state. Re- 
\clation, however, puts it beyond all 
doubt. The Divine Being hath pro- 
mised it, 1 John ii. 25. 1 John v. 11. 
James i. 12; hath given us some intima- 
tion of its glory, 1 Pet. iii. 4. 22. Rev. 
iii. 4. declares Christ hath taken pos- 
session of it for us, Jolin xiv. 2, 3. and 
informs us of some already there, both 
as to their bodies and souls, Gen. v. 24. 
2 Kings ii. 

Heax^en is to be considered as a place 
as well as a state: it is expressly so 
termed in Scripture, John xi\ . 2, 3 : 
and the existence of the body of Christ, 
and those of Enoch and Elijah, is a fur- 
ther proof of it. Yea, if it be not a 
place, where can these bodies be .'' and 
where will the bodies of the saints exist 
after the resurrection ? Where this 
ft lace is, however, cannot be determined. 
Some hiwe. thought it to be bevond the 
starry firmament ; and some of the an- 
cients imagined tliat their dwelling 
would be in the sun. Otliers suppose 
the air to be the seat of the blessed. 
Others think tha.t the saints will dwell 
upon earth when it shall be restored to 
its paradisaical state; but these suppo- 
sitions are more curious than edifying, 
and it becomes us to be silent where di- 
vine revelation is so. 

Heaven, ho-ivever, nve are assured, is 
a place of inexjiressible felicity. The 
names given to it are proofs of this: it 
is called paradise, Luke xxiii. 43.

chief good, in tlic compHny of angels and 
saints ; in perfect holinessj and exten- 
sive knowledge. 

It has been disfiuted ivhether there are 
degrees of glory in heaven. The argu- 
ments against degrees are, that all the 
people of God are loved by him with 
the; same love, all chosen together in 
Christ, equally interested in the same 
covenant of grace, equally redeemed 
with the same price, and all predesti- 
nated to the same adoption of children ; 
to suppose the contrary, it is said, is to 
eclipse the glory of divine grace, and 
carries with it the legal idea of being 
rewarded for our works. On the other 
side it is observed, that if the above 
reasoning would prove any thing, it 
would prove too much, viz. that Ave 
should all be upon an equality in the 
present world as well as that which is 
to come ; for we are now as mu^h the 
objects of the same love, purchased by 
the same blood, &amp;c. as we shall be 
hereafter. That rewards contain no- 
thing inconsistent with the doctrine of 
grace, because those very works which 
it pleiiseth God to honour are the effects 
of his own operation. That all rewards 
to a guilty creature have respect to the 
mediation of Christ. That God's gra- 
ciously connecting blessings with the 
obedience of his people, serves to show 
not only his love to Christ and to them, 
but his regard to righteousness. That 
the Sci'iptures expressly declare for 
degrees, Dan. xii. 3. Matt. x. 41, 42. 
Matt. xix. 28, 29. Luke xix. 16, 19. 
Rom. ii. 6. 1 Cor. iii. 8. 1 Cor. xv. 41, 
42. 2 Cor. v. 10. Gal. vi. 9. _ 

Another question has sometimes been 
proposed, vrz. Whether the sai7its shall 
know each other in heaven? 

" The arguments," savs Dr. Ridgley, 
"which are generally brought in de- 
fence of it, are taken from those in- 
stances recorded in Scripture, in which 
persons who have never seen one an- 
other before, have immediately known 
each other in this world, by a special 
immediate divine revelation given to 
them, in like manner as Adam knew 
that Eve was taken out of him; and 
therefore says. This is now bone of my 
bone, and flesh of my flesh: she shall 
be called ivoman, because she was taken 
out of man, Gen. ii. 23. He was cast 
into a deefi slceji, when God took out 
one of his ribs, and so formed the wo- 
man, as we read in the foregoing words ; 
yet the knowledge hereof was commu- 
nicated to him by God. Moreover, we 
read that Peter, James, and John, knew 
Mose^ and 4iilias, Matt. xvii. as appears 
from Peter's making a particular men- 



tion of them : Let us make three taber- 
nacles ; one for thee, ojiefor Moses, and 
one for Elias, 4th ver. though he had 
never seen them before. Again, our 
Saviour, in the parable, represents the 
rich man, as seeing Abraham afar off, 
and Lazarus in his bosom, Liike xvi. 
23, and speaks of him as addressing his 
discourse to him. From such like ar- 
guments, some conclude that it m.ay be 
uiferred that the saints shall know one 
another in hea\'en, when jomed together 
in the same assembly. 

" Moreover, some think that this may 
be proved from the apostle's words, iii 
1 Thess. ii. 19, 20. What is our hofie 
or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not 
even ye in the presence of our Lord 
Jesus Christ at his coining? for ye are 
our glory and joy ; which seems to 
argue, that he apprehended their hap- 
piness in heaven should contribute, or 
be an addition to his, as he was made 
an instrument to bring them thither ; 
CA'en so, by a parity of reason, every 
one who has been instrumental in the 
conversion and building up others in 
their holy faith, as the apostle Paul was 
with respect to them, these shall tend 
to enhance their praise, and give them 
occasion to glorify God on their behalf. 
Therefore it follows that they shall 
know one another ; and consequently 
they who have walked together in the 
ways of God, and have been useful to 
one another as relations and intimate 
friends, in what respects more espe- 
cially their spiritual concerns, these 
shall bless God for the mutual advan- 
tages which they have received, and 
consequently shall know one another. 
Again ; some prove this from that ex- 
pression of our Saviour in Luke x\i. 9. 
Make to yourselves friends of the mam- 
mon of unrighteousness, that, ivhen ye 
fail, they may receive you into everlast- 
ing habitations ; especially if by these 
everlasting habitations be meant hea- 
ven, as many suppose it is; and then the 
meaning is, that they whom you have 
relieved, and shown kindness to in this 
world, shall express a particiUar joy 
upon your being admitted into heaven ; 
and consequently they shall know you, 
and bless God for your having been so 
useful and beneficial to them. 

" To this it is objected that if the 
saints shall know one another in heaven, 
•they shall know that several of those 
who were their intimate friends here on 
earth, whom they loved with veiy great 
affection, are not there ; and this will 
have a tendency to give them some un- 
easiness, and a diminution of their joy 
and happiness.

^'To this it may be replied, that if it 
be allowed that the saints shall know 
tiiat some whom they loved on earth 
are not in heaven, this will give them no 
uneasiness: since that affection which 
took its rise principally from the rela- 
tion which we stood m to persons on 
earth, or the intimacy, that we have 
contracted with them, will cease in an- 
other world, or rather run in another 
channel, and be excited by superior 
motives; namely, their relation to 
Christ ; that perfect holiness which 
they are adoryed with ; their being 
joined in the same blessed society, and 
engaged in the same employment, to- 
gether with their former usefulness one 
to another in promoting their spiritual 
welfare, as made subservient to the 
happiness they enjoy there. And as 
for othei-s, v&gt;'ho are excluded from their 
society, they will think themselves obli- 
ged, out of a due regard to the justice 
and holiness of God to acquiesce in his 
righteous judgments. Thus, the inha- 
bitants of heaven are represented as 
adoring the divine perfections, when the 
vials of God's wrath were poured out 
upon his enemies, and saying. Thou art 
righteous, O Lard, because thou hast 
judged thus: true and righteous are 
thy judgments, Rev. xvi. 5, 7. 

"Another question has been some- 
times asked, viz. Whether there shall be 
a diversity of languages in heaven, as 
there is on earth ? This we cannot 
pretend to determine. Some think that 
there shall ; and that, as pei-sons of all 
nations and tongues shall make up that 
blessed society, so they shall praise God 
in the same language which they be- 
fore used when on earth; and that tliis 
worship may be performed with the 
greatest harmony, and to mutual edifi- 
cation, all the saints shall, by the imme- 
diate power and providence of God, be 
able to understand and make use of 
every one of those different languages, 
as well as their own. This tliey found 
on the apostle's words, in which he says, 
That at the na?ne of Jesus every knee 
should bow, and that every tongue 
should confess that Jesus Christ is 
Lord; which they suppose has a respect 
to the hea\enly state, because it is said 
to be done both by those that are in 
heaven, and those that are on earth, 
Phil. ii. 10, 11. But though the apos- 
tle speaks by a metonymy of different 
tongues, that is&gt;, persons who speak 
different languages being subject to 
Christ, he probably means thereby per- 
sons of different nations, whether they 
shall praise him in their own language 
JJi heaven, or no. Thei'efore some 



conjecture that the diversity of langua- 
ges shall then cease, inasmuch as it took 
its first rise from God's judicial hand, 
when he confounded the speech of those 
who presumptuously attempted to build 
the city and tower of Babel ; and this 
has been ever since attended with many 
inconveniences. And, indeed, the apos- 
tle seems expressly to intimate as much, 
when he says, speaking concerning the 
heavenly state, that tongues shall 
cease, 1 Cor. xiii. 8. that is, the present 
variety of languages. — Moreover, since 
the gift of tongues was bestowed on 
the apostles for the gathering and 
building up the church in the first ages 
thereof, which end, when it was an- 
SAvered, this extraordinary dispensation 
ceased ; in like manner it is probable 
that hereafter the diversity of langua- 
ges shall cease." 

" I am sensible," says Dr. Ridgley, 
"there are some who object to this, that 
the saints understanding all languages, 
will be an addition to their honour, glo- 
ry, and happiness. £ut to this it may 
be answered, that though it is, indeed, 
an accomplishment, in this world, for a 
person to understand several languages, 
that arises from the subserviency there- 
of to those valuable ends that are an- 
swered thereby ; but this would be en- 
tirely removed, if the diversity of lan- 
guages be taken away in heaven, as 
some suppose it will." 

"There are some, who, it may be, 
give too much scope to a vain curiosity, 
when they pretend to enquire what 
this language shall be, or determine, as 
the Jews do, and with them some of the 
fathers, that it shall be Hebrew, since 
their arguments for it are not suffi- 
ciently conclusive, which are principally 
these, viz. That this was the language 
with which God inspired man at first m 
pai-adise, and that which tlie saints and 
patriarchs spake, and the church gene- 
rally made use of in all ages till our Sa- 
viour's time ; and that it was this lan- 
guage which he himself spake while 
here on earth ; and since his ascension 
into heaven, he spake to Paul zw the 
Hebrew tongue. Acts xxvi. 14. And 
when the inhabitants of heaven are de- 
scribed in the Revelations as praising 
(iod, there is one word used by whicJi 
their praise is expressed, namely. Hal- 
lelujah, which is liebi'ew: the meaning 
whereof is. Praise ye the Loi'd. But all 
these arguments are not sufficiently con- 
vincing, and therefore we must reckon 
it no more than a conjecture." 

However undecided we may be as to 
this and some other circumstances, this 
we may be assured of, tliat the hapfii-

it wifl be progressive or not, and that 
the saints shall always be increasing in 
their knowledge, joy, &amp;c. is not so clear. 
Some suppose that this indicates«an im- 
perfection in the felicity of the saints 
tor any addition to be made; but others 
think it quite analogous to the dealings 
of God with us here; and that, from 
the nature of the mind itself, it may be 
concluded. But however tliis be, it is

HELL, the place of divine punish- 
ment after death. As all religions have 
supposed a future state of existence 
after this life, so all have their hell, or 
place of torment, in which the wicked 
are to be punished. ^ Even the heathens 
had their tartara; and the Mahome- 
tans, we find, believe the eternity of 
vewai'ds and punishments; it is not, 
therefore, a sentiment peculiar to Chris- 
tianity. • 

There have been manv curious and 
useless conjectures respecting the place 
of th.e danmed: the ancients generally 
supposed it was a region of fire near 
the centre of the earth. Mr. Swinden 
endeavoured to pro\e that it is seated 
in the sun. Mr. W^liiston advanced a 
new and strange hypotliesis ; according 
to him, the comets are so many hells, 
appointed in their orbits alternately to 
carry the damned to the confines of the 
sun, there to be scorched by its violent 
heat; and then to return witli tliem be- 
yond the orb of Saturn, there to starve 
them in those cold and dismal regions. 
But, as Dr. Doddridge observes, we 
must here confess our ignorance ; and 
shall be much better employed in stu- 
dying how we may avoid this place of 
horror, than in labouring to discover 
where it is. 

Of the nature of this /mnishment we 
may form some idea from tlie ezpres- 
sions made use of in Scripture. It is 
called a place of torment, Luke xvi. 
21. the bottomless pit. Rev. xx. 3 to 6. 
a prison,.! Pet, iii. 19. darkness. Matt. 
viii. 12. Jude 13. five, Matt. xiii. 42, 50. 
a worm that never dies, Mark ix. 44, 
48, the second death. Rev. xxi. 8. the 
wrath of God, Rom. ii. 5. It has been 
debated whether tliere will be a mate- 
riul^fire in hell. On the affirmative side 
it is observed, that fire and brimstone 



are represented as tlie ingredients rf 
the torment of the wicked. Rev. xiv. 
10, 11. Rev. XX. 10. That as the body is 
to be raised, and the Ayhole man to be 
condemned, it is reasonable to believe 
there will be some coi-poreal punish- 
ment provided, and therefore probably 
material fire. On the negative side it 
is alleged, that the terms above-men- 
tioned are metaphorical, and signify no 
more than raging desire or acute pain ; 
and that the Divine Being can sufficient- 
ly punish the wicked, by immediately 
acting on their minds, or raiher leaving 
them to the guilt and stings of their own 
conscience. According to several pas- 
sages, it seems there will be different 
decrees of punishment in hell, Luke xii. 
47. Rom. ii. 12. Matt. x. 20, 21. Matt, 
xii. 25, 32. Heb. x. 28, 29. 

.4s to its duration, it has been obser- 
ved that it cannot be eternal, because 
there is no proportion between tempo- 
rary crimes and eternal punishments; 
that the word everlasting is not to be 
taken in its utmost extent ; and that it 
signifies no more than a long time, or a 
time whose precise boundary is un- 
known. But m answer to this it is al- 
leged, that the same word is used, and 
that sometimes in the very same place, 
to express the eternity of the happiness 
of the righteous, and the eternity of the 
misery of the wicked; and tliat there 
is no reason to believe that the words 
express two sucii different ideas, as 
standing in the same connection. Be- 
sides, it is not true, it is observed, that 
temporary crimes do not deserve eter- 
nal punishments, liecause the infinite 
majesty of an offended God adds a kind 
of infinite evil to sin, and therefore ex- 
poses tlie sinner to infinite punishment ; 
and that hereby God vindicates his in- 
jured majesty, and glorifies his justice.

} HELL, Christ's descent into. That 
Christ locally descended into hell, is a 
I doctrine believed not only by the pa- 
i pists, but by many among the reformed. 
1. The text chiefly brought forward in 
support of this doctrine is the 1st Peter, 
iii. 19. " By which he went and preach- 
ed to the spirits in prison ;" but it evi- 
dently appears that tlie " spirit" there 
mentioned was not Christ's human soul, 
but a divine nature, or rather the Holy

Spirit (by which he was quickened, and 
raised from the dead ;) and by the in- 
spiration of which, granted to Noah, he 
preached to those notorious sinners who 
are now in the prison of hell for their 
disobedience. 

2. Christ, when on the cross, promis- 
ed the penitent thief his presence that 
day in paradise ; and accordingly, when 
he died, he committed his soul into his 
heavenly Father's hand: in heaven 
therefore, and not in hell, we are to seek 
the separate spirit of our Redeemer in 
this period, Luke xxiii. 43, 46. 

3. Had our Lord descended to preach 
to the damned, there is no s\ipposable 
reason why the unbelievers in Noah's 
time OTily should be mentioned rather 
than those of Sodom, and the unhappy 
nuiltitudes that died in sin. But it may 
be said, do not both the Old and New 
Testaments intimate this? Ps. xvi. 10. 
Acts ii. 34. But it may be answered, 
that the words, "thou wilt not lea\'e 
my soul in hell," may be explained (as 
is the manner of the Hebi'ew poets) in 
the following words: "Neither wilt 
thou suffer thine holy one to see cor- 
ruption." So the same words are used, 
Ps. Ixxxix. 48. — "What man is he that 
liveth, and shall not see death ? shall 
he deliver his soul from the hand of the 
grave?" In the Hebrew (Sli&lt;tJ') the 
word commonly rendered hell properly 
signifies "the invisible state,' as our 
word hell originally did ; and the other 
word (ty3J) signifies not always the im- 
moilal soul, but the animal frame in 
general, either living or dead. Bishofi

HELLENISTS, a term occurring in 
the Greek text of the New Testament, 
and which in the English version is ren- 
dered Grecians, Acts vi. 1. The critics 
are divided as to the signification of the 
word. Some observe, that it is not to be 
understood as signifying those of the re- 
ligion of the Greeks, but those who 
spoke Greek. The authors of the Vul- 
gate version render it like our Grgeri ; 
but Messieurs Du Port Royal, moi-e ac- 
curately, Jidfs Grecs, Greek or Gre- 
cian Jews; it being the Jews who spoke 
Greek that are here treated of, and who 
ai'e hereby distinguished from the Jews 
called Hebrews, that is, who spoke the 
Hebrew tongue of that time. 

The Hellenists, or Grecian Jews, 
were those who lived in Egypt, and 
other parts where the Greek tongue 
prevailed: it is to them we owe the 



Greek version of the Old Testament, 
commonly called the Sejituagint, or 
that of the Seventj. 

Salmasius and \ osslus are of a differ- 
ent sentiment with respect to the Hel- 
lenists : the latter will only have them 
to Ijc tliose who adhered to the Grecian 
interests. Scaliger is represented in the 
Scaligerana as assei'ting the Hellenists 
to be the Jews who li\ed in Greece and 
other places, and who read the Greek 
Bible in their synagogues, and used the 
Greek language in sacris; and thus they 
were opposed to the Hebrew Jews, who 
performed their public worship in the 
Hebrew tongue ; and in this sense St. 
Paul speaks of himself as a Hebrew of 
the Hebrews, Phil. iii. 5, 6. i. e. a He- 
brew both by nation and language. 
The Hellenists are thus properly dis- 
tinguished from the Hellenes, or Greeks, 
mentioned John xii. 20. who were Greeks 
by birth and nation, and yet proselytes 
to tlie Jewish religion. 

HEMEROBAPTlSTS,a sect among 
the ancient Jews-, thus called from their 
washing and l&gt;athing every day, in all 
seasons; and performing this custom 
with the greatest solemnity, as a reli- 
gious rite necessary to salvation. 

Epiphanius, who mentions this as the 
fourth heresy among the Jews, observes, 
that in other points these heretics had 
much the same opinion as the Scribes 
and Pharisees ; only that they denied 
the resurrection of the dead, in common 
with the Sadducees, and retained a few 
other of the improprieties of these las.t. 
The sect who pass in the East under 
the denomination of Sabians, calling 
themselves Mendai liahi, or the disci- 
ples of St. John, and whom the Eu- 
ropeans entitle the Christians of St. 
John, because they yet retain some 
knowledge of the Gospel, is probably 
of Jewish origin, and seems to have been 
derived from the ancient Hemerobap- 
tists; at least it is certain that John, 
whom they consider as the founder of 
their sect, bears no sort of similitude to 
John the Baptist, but rather resembles 
the person of that name whom the an- 
cient writers represent as the chief of 
the Jewish Hemerobaptists. These; am- 
biguous Christians dwell in Persia and 
Arabia, and principally at Bassora; and 
their religion consists in bodily wash- 
ings, performed frequently and -with 
great solemnity, and attended with cer- 
tain ceremonies which the priests min- 
gle with this superstitious service. 

HENOTICON.a famous edict of the 
emperor Zeno, pu!jlished A. D. 482, 
and intended to reconcile and rc-unitc 
the Eutvchians witli the Catholics. It

was procured of the emperor by means 
of Acacius, patriarch of Constantinnple, 
with tlie assistance of the friends of Pe- 
ter Mongus and Peter Trullo. The sting 
of this edict hes here; that it repeats and 
confirms all that has been enacted in the 
councils of Nice, Constantinople, Ephe- 
sus, and Chalcedon, against the Arians, 
Nestorians, and Eutychians, without 
making any particular mention of the 
council of Chalcedon. It is in the form 
of a letter, addressed by Zeno to the 
bishops, priests, monks, and people of 
Egypt and Libya. It was opposed by 
the Catholics, and condemned in form 
by pope Felix II. 

HENRICIANS, a sect so called from 
Henry, its founder, who, though a monk 
and hermit, undertook to reform the 
superstition and vices of the clergy. For 
this purpose he left Lausanne, in Swit- 
zerland, and, removing from different 
places, at length settled at Tholouse, in 
the year 1147, and there exercised liis 
ministerial function ; till, being over- 
come h^ the opposition of Bernard, ab- 
bot of Clairval, and condemned by pope 
Eugenius III. at a council assembled at 
Rheims, he was committed to a close 
prison in 1148, where he soon ended his 
days. — This reformer rejected the bap- 
tism of infants, severely censured the 
corrupt manners of the clergy, treated 
the festivals and ceremonies of the 
church with the utmost contempt, and 
held private assemblies for inculcating 
his peculiar doctrines. 

HER ACLEONITES, a sect of Chris- 
tians, the followers of Heracleon, who 
refined upon the Gnostic divinity, and 
maintained that the world was not the 
immediate production of tlie Son of God, 
but that he was only the occasional 
cause of its being created by tlie demiur- 
gus. The Heracleonites denied the au- 
thority of the prophecies of the Old 
Testament ; maintained that they were 
mere random sounds in the air; and 
that St. John the Baptist was the only 
true voice that directed to the Messiah. 
HERESIARCH, an arch heretic, the 
founder or inventor of an heresy; or a 
chief of a sect of heretics. 

HERESY. This word signifies sect 
or choice ; it was not in its earliest ac- 
ceptation conceived to coin^ey any re- 
proach, since it was indiffercntlv used 
cither of a party ap])roved, or of one 
disapproved by the writer. See Acts 
V. 17. XV. 3. Afterwards it was gene- 
rally used to signify some fundamental 
erroi- adhered to with obstinacy, 2 Pet. 
ii. 1. Gal. V. 20. 

According to the laws of this king- 
dom, heresy consists in a denial of some ! 



of the essential doctrines of Christianity, 
publicly and obstinately avowed. It must 
be acknowledged, however, that par- 
ticular modes of belief or unbclieff not 
tending to overturn Christianity, or to 
sap the foundations of morality, are by 
no means the object of coercion by the 
civil magistrate. What doctrines shall 
therefore be adjudged heresy, was left 
by our old constitution to the determi- 
nation of the ecclesiastical judge, who 
had herein a most arbitrar)- latitude al- 
lowed him ; for the general definition 
of an heretic, given by Lyndewode, ex- 
tends to the smallest deviations from the 
doctrines of the holy chm-ch : " Hsereti- 
cus est qui dubitat de fide catholica, et 
(jui ?iegligit servare ea qme Romana ec- 
clesia stutuit, seu serx'are decreverat :" 
or, as the statute, 2 Hen. IV. cap. 15, 
expresses it in English, "teachers of 
erroneous opinions, contrary to the 
faith and blessed determinations of the 
holy church." Very contrary this to 
the usage of the fir.st general councils, 
Avhich defined all heretical doctrines 
with the utmost precision and exactness; 
and what ought to have alleviated the 
punishment, , the uncertainty of the 
crime, seems to have enhanced it in 
those days of blind zeal and pious 
cruelty. The sanctimonious hypocrisy 
of the Canonists, indeed, went, at first, 
no faither than enjoining penance, ex- 
communication, and ecclesiastical de- 
privation, for heresy ; but afterwards 
they proceeded boldly to imprisonment 
by the ordinary, and confiscation of 
goods in fiio.s iisus. But in the mean 
time they had prevailed upon the weak- 
ness of bigoted princes to make the ci- 
vil power subservient to their pui-poses, 
by making heresy not only a temporal 
but even a cajntal offence ; the Romish 
ecclesiastics determining, without ap- 
peal, whatever they pleased to be he- 
resy, and shifting off to the secular arm 
the odium and drudgery of executions, 
with which they pretended to be too 
tender and delicate to intei-meddle. 
Nay, they affected to intercede on be- 
half of the convicted heretic, well 
knowing that at the same time they 
were delivering the unhappy victim to 
certain death. See Act of Faith. — 
Hence the capital punishments inflicted 
on the ancient Donatists and Mani- 
clixans by the emperoi-sTheodosius and 
Justinian ; hence, also, the constitution 
of the emperor Frederic, mentioned 
by Lyndewode, adjudging all persons, 
without distinction, to be burnt with fire, 
who were convicted of heresy by the 
ecclesiastical judge. The .same empe- 
ror, in another constitution, ordained, 



HER 



215 



HER 



that if any temporal lord, when admo- 
nished by the church, should neglect to 
clear his territories of heretics within a 
year, it should be lawful for good Ca- 
tholics to sieze and occupy the lands, 
and utterly to exterminate the hei'etical 
possessors. And upon this foundation 
was built that arbitraiy power, so long 
claimed, and so fatally exerted by the 
pope, of disposing even of the kingdoms 
of refractory pnnces to more dutiful 
sons of the church. The immediate 
event of this constitution serves to illus- 
trate at once the gratitude of the holy 
see, and the just punishment of the royal 
bigot ; for, upon the authority of this 
very constitution, the pope afterwai'ds 
expelled this very emperor Frederic 
from his kingdom of Sicily, and gave it 
to Charles ot Anjou. Christianity being 
thus deformed by the dxmon of perse- 
cution upon the continent, our own 
island could not escape its scourge. Ac- 
cordingly we find a writ de heeretko 
coviburendo, i. e. of burning tlie heretic. 
See that article. But the king might 
pardon tlie convict by issuing no pro- 
cess against him : the writ de hxrctko 
comburendo being not a writ of course, 
but issuing only by the special direction 
of the king in council. In the reign of 
Henry IV. when the eyes of the Chris- 
tian world liegan to open, and the seeds 
of the Protestant religion (under the 
opprobrious name of Lollnrdy) took 
root in this kingdom, the clergy, taking 
advantage from the king's dubious title 
to demand an increase of their own 
power, obtained an act of parliament, 
which sharpened the edge of persecu- 
tion to its utmost keenness. See H^ere- 
Tico Comburendo. By statute 2 
Henry V. c. 7, Lollardy was also made 
a temporal oftence, and indictable in the 
king's courts; which did not thereby 
gain an exclusive, but only a concurrent 
jurisdiction v/ ith the bishop's consistory. 
Afterwards, when the reformation be- 
gan to advance, the power of the ec- 
clesiastics was somewhat moderated ; 
for though what heresy is was not then 
precisely defined, yet we are told in 
some points what it is not; the statute 
25 Hen. VIII. c. 14. declaring that of- 
fences against the see of Rome are not 
heresy ; and the ordinary being thereby 
restrained from proceeding in any case 
upon mere suspicion ; i. e. unless the 
party be accused by two credible wit- 
nesses, or an indictment of heresy be 
first previously fomid in the king's courts 
of common law. And yet the spirit of 
persecution was not abated, but only di- 
verted into a lay channel ; for in six 
years afterwards, by stat. 31 Hen. VIII. 



c. 14. the bloody law of the six articles 
was made, which were "determined 
and resolved by the most godly study, 
pain, and travail of his majesty ; for 
which his most humble and obedient 
subjects, the lords spiritual and tempo- 
ral, and the commons in parliament as- 
sembled, did render and give unto his 
highness their most high and hearty 
thanks!" The same statute established 
a mixed jurisdiction of clergy and laity 
for the trial and conviction of heretics ; 
Henry being equally intent on destroy- 
ing the supremacy of the bishops of 
Rome, and establishing all their other 
corruptions of the Christian religion. 
Without recapitulating the various re- 
peals and revivals of these sanguinary 
laws in the two succeeding reigns, we 
proceed to the reign of Queen Elizabeth, 
when the reformation was finally esta- 
blished with temper and decency, un- 
sullied with party rancour or personal 
resentment. — By stat. 1. Eliz. c. 1. all 
former statutes relating to heresy are 
repealed; which leaves the jurisdiction 
of heresy as it stood at common law, viz. 
as to the infliction of common censures 
in the ecclesiastical courts ; and in case 
of burning the heretic, in the provincial 
synod only. Sir Matthew Hale is, in- 
deed, of a different opinion, and holds 
that such power resided in the diocesan 
also: though he agrees that in either 
case the writ de hseretico comburendo 
was not demandable of common I'ight, 
but grantable or otherwise merely at 
the king's discretion. But the principal 
point now gained was, that by this sta- 
tute a boundary was for the first time 
set to what should be accounted heresy ; 
nothing for the futui'e being to be so de- 
termined, but only such tenets which 
have been heretofore so declared, — 1. by 
the words of the canonical Scriptures;-^ 
2. by the first four general councils, or 
sucli others as have only used the words 
of the Holy Scriptures ; or, — 3. which 
shall hereafter be so declared by the 
parliament, with the assent of the cler- 
gy in convocation. Thus was heresy 
reduced to a greater certainty than 
before, though it m.ight not have been 
the worse to have defined it in terms 
still more precise and particular ; as a 
man continued still liable to be bun\t for 
what, perhaps, he did not understand to 
be heresy, till the ecclesiastical judge 
so interpreted the words of the canoni- 
cal Scriptures. For the v/rit de hxre- 
tico comburendo remained stiil in force, 
tUl it was totally abolished, and heresy 
again .subjected only to ecclesiastical 
correction, firo salute animee, by stat. 
29 Car. II. c. 9 ; when, in one and the 



HER

HEX 



same reign, om- lands were delivered 
from the slavery of military tenures ; 
our bodies from arbitrary imprisonment 
by the habeas corpus act : and our 
niinds from the tyranny of superstitious 
bigotrj-, by demplishing this last badge 
of persecution in the English law. 
Every thing is now less exceptionable, 
with respect to the spiritual cognizance 
and spiritual punishment of h.crcsy ; un- 
less, perhaps, that the crime ought to 
be more strictly defined, and no prose- 
cution permitted, e\-en in the ecclesias- 
tical courts, till the tenets in question 
are by proper authority previously de- 
clared to be heretical. Under these re- 
strictions, some think it necessaiy, for 
the support of the national religion, that 
the officers of the church should have 
power to censure lieretics ; yet not to 
harass them with temporal penalties, 
much less to exterminate or destroy 
them. The legislature has, indeed, 
thought it proper that the civil magis- 
trate should intei-pose v/ith regard to 
one species of heresy, very prevalent in 
modern times ; for by stat. 9 and 10, W. 
III. c. 32. if any person, educated in the 
Christian religion, or professing the 
same, shall, by writing, printing, teach- 
ing, or advised speaking, deny any one 
of the persons in the Holy Trinity to be 
God, or maintain that there are more 
.Gods than one, he shall undergo the 
same penalties and incapacities which 
were inflicted on apostasy by the same 
statute. Enc. Brit. Dr. Foster and 
Stebbhi^ on Heresy; Halletfs Discour- 
ses, vol. iii. No. 9. p. 358, 408 ; Dr.

HERETIC, a general name for all 
such persons under any religion, but 
especially the Christian, as profess or 
teach opinions contrary to the establish- 
ed faith, or to what is made tlie standard 
of orthodoxy. See last article, and 
iMrdner^s History of the Heretics of the 
first two Centuries. 

HERMIANI, a sect m the second 
century ; so called from their leader 
Hermias. One of their distinguishing 
tenets was, that God is coi-poreal ; 
anothei", that Jesus Christ did not as- 
cend into heaven with his body, but left 
it in the sun. 

HERMIT, a person who retires into 
solitude for the purpose of devotion. 
Who were the first hermits cannot ea- 
sily be known ; though Paul, surnamed 
tlie hermit, is generally reckoned the 
first. I'he persecutions of Decius and 
Valerian were supposed to have occa- 
sioned their first rise. 

HERMOGENIANS, a sect of an- 
cient heretics; denominated from their 



leader Hermogenes, who lived towards 
the close of the second century. Her- 
mogenes established matter as his first 
principle ; and regarding matter as the 
fountain of all e\ il, he maintained, that 
the world, and every thing contained in 
it, as also the souls of men and other 
spirits, were formed by the Deity ft'om 
an uncreated and eternal mass of cor- 
i-upt matter. The opinions of Hermo- 
genes with regard to the origin of the 
world, and the nature of the soul, were 
warmly opposed bv Tertullian. 

HERNHUTTERS. See Moravi- 
ans. 

HERODIANS, a sect among the 
Jews, at the time of our Saviour, Matt, 
xxii. 16. Mark iii. 6. The critics and 
commentators are very much divided 
with regaixl to the Herodians. St. Je- 
rome, ill his dialogue against the Lu- 
ciferians, takes the name to have been 
given to such as owned Herod for the 
Messiah ; and Tertullian and Epipha- 
nius are of the same opinion. But the 
same Jerome, in his comment on St. 
Matthew, treats this opinion as ridicu- 
lous ; and maintains that tlie Pharisees 
gave this appellation, by way of ridicule, 
to Herod's soldiers, who paid tribute to 
the Romans; agreealile to which the 
Syrian interpreters render the word 
by the domestics of Herod, i. e. "his 
courtiers." iVI. Simon, in his notes on 
the 22d chapter of Matthew, advances 
a more probable opinion; the name He- 
rodian he imagines to have been given 
to such as adhered to Herod's party and 
interest, and were foi- presci'ving the 
government in his family, about which 
were great divisions among the Jews. 
F. Hardouin will have the Herodians 
and Sadducees to have been the same. 
Dr. Prideanx is of opinion that they 
derived their name ti'om Herod the 
Great ; and that thev were distinguish- 
ed from the other Je^vs by their con- 
currence with Herod's scheme of sub- 
jecting himself and his dominions to the 
Romans, and likewise by complying 
with many of their heathen usages and 
customs. This symbolizing witli idola- 
try upon views of interest and worldly 
policy was probably that leaven of He- 
rod, against which our Saviour caution- 
ed his disciples. It is further probable 
that they were chiefly of the sect of the 
Sadducees ; because the leaven of He- 
rod is also denominated the leaven of 
the Sadducees. 

HETERODOX, something that is 
contrary to the faith or doctrine esta- 
blished in the tnic church. See Or- 
thodox.

columns, containing the text and dh-crs 
versions thereof, compiled and publish- 
ed by Origen, with a view of securing 
the sacred text from future cormptions, 
and to correct those that had been al- 
ready introduced. Eusebius relates, 
that Origen, after his return from Rome 
under Caracalla, applied himself to 
leam Hebrew, and began to collect the 
several versions that had been made of 
the sacred writings, and of these to com- 

Eose his Tetrapla and Hexapla; others, 
owever, will not allow him to have be- 
gun till the time of Alexander, after he 
had retired into Palestine, about the 



yeai- 



231. To conceive what this Hex- 



apla was, it must be observed, that, be- 
sides the translation of the sacred wri- 
tings, called the Scptuagint, made under 
Ptolemy Philadelphus, above 280 years 
before Christ, the Scripture had been 
since translated into Greek by other in- 
terpreters. The first of those versions, 
or (reckoning the Septuagint) the se- 
cond, was that of Acjuila, a prosch te 
Jew, the first edition of which he pub- 
lished in the 12th year of the ernpei-or 
Adrian, or about the year of Christ 128 ; 
the third was that of Symmachus, pub- 
lished, as is commonly supposed, under 
Marcus Aurelius, but, as some say, 
under Septimiiis Severus, about the 
year 200 ; the fourth was that of Theo- 
dotion, prior to that of Symmachus, un- 
der Commodus, or about the year 175. 
These Greek versions, says Dr. Kenni- 
cott, wej-e made by the Jews from their 
corrupted copies of the Hebrew, and 
were designed to stand in the place of 
the Sevent)-, against which the}^ were 
prejudiced, because it seemed to favour 
the Christians. The fifth was found at 
Jericho, in the reign of Caracalla, aljout 
the year 217 : and the sixth was disco- 
vered at "Nicopolis, in the reign of Alex- 
ander Severus, about the year 228 ; 
lastly, Origen himself recovered part of 
a seventh, containing only the Psalms. 
Now, Origen, who had held frequent 
disputations with the Jews in Eg^'pt and^ 
I'alestine, obsei-ving that they always 
objected to those passages of Scripture 

Quoted against them, appealed to the 
lebrew text, the better to vindicate 
those passages, and confound the Jews, 
by showing that the Seventy had giyen 
the sense of the Hebrew ; or rather to 
show, by a number of different versions, 
what the real sense of the Hebrew Avas, 
undei'took to reduce all these several 
versions into a body, along with the He- 
^bi-ew text, so as they might be easily 
confronted, and affo'-d a mutual light to 
each other. He made the Hebrew text 
his standard; and allowing that cor- 



niptions might have happened, and that 
the old Hebrew copies might and did 
read differently, he contented himself 
with marking such words or sentencesas 
were not in his Hebrew text, nor the la- 
ter Greek versions, and adding such, 
words or sentences as were omitted in 
the Seventy, prefixing an asterisk to the 
additions, and an obelisk to the others. 
In order to this, he made choice of eight, 
columns ; in the first he made the He- 
brew text, in Hebrew characters ; in 
the second, the same text in Greek 
characters; the rest were filled witli 
the several versions above-mentioned ; 
all the columns answering Aerse for 
\'erse, and phrase for phrase ; and in the 
Psalms there was a ninth column for the 
Sl■^■enth version. This woi'k Origen call- 
ed 'E^awKa, Hexapla, q. d. sextuple, or 
work of six columns, as only regarding 
the first six Greek versions. St. Epi- 
phanius, taking in likewise the two co- 
lumns of the text, calls the work Octa- 
pla, as consisting of eight columns. This 
celebrated work, which Montfaucon 
imagines consisted of sixty large vo- 
lumes, perished long ago ; probably with 
the library at Cxsarea, where it was 
preserved in the year 653 ; though seve- 
ral of the ancient writers have preserv- 
ed us pieces thereof, particularly St. 
Chrysostom on the Psalms, Phileponus 
in his Hexumeron, &amp;c. Some modern 
.writers have earnestly endeavoured to 
collect fragments of the Hexapla, par- 
ticularly Flaminius, Nobilius, Di-usius, 
and F. Montfaucon, in two folio volumes 
printed at Paris in 1713. 

HIERACITES, heretics in the third 
century ; so called from their leader 
Hierax, a philosopher, of Egypt, who 
taught that Melchisedec was the Holy 
Gliost ; denied the resurrection and con- 
demned marriage. 

HIERARCHY, an ecclesiastical es- 
tablishment. The word is also used in re- 
ference to the subordination some sup- 
pose there is among the angels : but whe- 
ther they are to be considered as having 
a government or hierarchy among them- 
selves, so that one is superior in office 
and dignity to otliers ; or whether they 
have a kind of dominion over one ano- 
ther ; or whether some are made par- 
takers of privileges others are deprived 
of, cannot be determined, since Scrip- 
ture is silent as to this matter. 

HIGH CHURCHMEN, a term first 
given to the non-jurors, who refused to

HOFFMANISTS, those who espous- 
ed the sentiments of Daniel Hoffman, 
professor in the university of Plehnstadt, 
who in the year 1598 taught tliat the 
li,c;ht of reason, even as it appears in the 
writings of Plato and Ari.stotle, is ad- 
verse to religion ; and that the more the 
human understanding is cultivated by 
philosopliical study, the more perfectly 
js the enemy supplied with weapons of 
defence. 

HOLINESS, freedom from sin, or 
the conformity of the heart to God. It 
does not consist in knowledge, talents, 
nor outward ceremonies of religion, but 
hath its seat in the heart, and is the ef- 
fect of a principle of grace implanted by 
the Holy Spirit, Eph. ii. 8, 10. John iii. 5. 
Rom. vi. 22. It is the essence of happi- 
ness and the basis of true dignity, Prov. 
iii. 17. Prov. iv. 8. It will manifest itself 
by tlie propriety of our conversation, 
rcgulai'ity of our temper, and uniformity 
of our lives. It is a principle pi'ogressive 
in its operation, Prov. iv. 18, and i\l:)so- | 
lutely essential to tlie enjoyment of God 
here and hei-eafter, Heb. xii. 14. See 
SanctIkication. ""A'orks. 

HOLINESS OF GOD, is the purity 
and rectitude of his nature. It is an es- 
seutial attriljute of (iod, and what is 
the glory, lustre, and harmony of all his 
other perfections, Ps. xxvii. 4. Exod.

it, Dent, xxxii. 4. It is injiiiitc and ?/«-

is so. of and in himself, and the author 
and firomottr of all holiness among his 
creatures. The holiness of God is visi- 
ble by his vjorks ; he made all things 
holy. Gen. i. 31. By his /irovidences, all

HOLOCAUST, formed from oAos, 
"whole," and xaiu, "I consume with 
fire ;" a kind of saci'ifice wlierein the 
whole bui'ut offering is burnt or c*nsum- 1 
ed by fire, as an acknowledgment that | 



God, tlic Creator, Presen'er, and Lord 
of all, was worthy of all honour and 
worship, and as a token of men's giving 
them.selvcs entirely up to him. It is call- 
ed in Scripture a burnt-offci-ing. Sacri- 
fices of this sort are often menti&lt;ined by 
the heathens as well as Jews. They ap- 
pear to have been in use long before the 
institution of other Jewish sacrifices by 
the law of Moses, Job i. 5. Job xlii.. 8. 
Gen. xxii. 13. Gen. viii. 20. On this 
account, the Jews, who would not allow 
the Gentiles to. offer on their altar any 
other sacrifices peculiarly enjoined by 
the law of Moses, admitted them by 
the Jewish priests to offer holocausts,, 
because these were a sort of sacrifices 
prior to tlie law, and common to all 
nations. During their subjection to the 
Romans, it was no unconmion thing for 
those Gentiles to offer sacrifices to the 
God of Israel at Jerusalem. Holocausts 
were deemed by the Jews the most ex- 
cellent of all tlieir sacrifices. See Sa- 
crifice. 

HOLY DAY, a day set apart by the 
church for the commemoration of some 
saint, or some remai'kable particular in 
the life of Christ. It has been a ques- 
tion agitated by divines, whether it be 
proper to appoint or keep any holy days 
(the Sabbath cxccjited.) The advo- 
cates for holy&lt;lays suppose that they 
have a tendency to impress the minds 
of the peo])le with a greater sense of 
religion ; that if the acquisitions and 
victories of men be celeljrated with the 
highest joy, how much more those 
events which relate to the sahation of 
man, such as tlie Ijirth, death, and re- 
surrectiim of Christ, fee. On the other 
side it is observed, that if holy days 
had been necessary under the present 
dispensation, Jesus Christ would have 
observed something respecting jthem, 
whereas he was silent about th.em ; that 
it is bringing us again into- that bondage 
to ceremonial laws from which Christ 
freed us ; that it is a tacit reflection on 
the Head of the church in not appoint- 
ing them ; that such days, on the whole, 
are more pernicious than useful to so- 
ciety, as they open a door for indolence 
and pi'ofaneness ; yea, that Scripture 
speaks against such days. Gal. iv. 9 — 11.

I. The*Holy Ghost is a real and dis- 
einct fierson in the Godhead. 1. Per- | 
sonal powers of rational undei'standin&lt;^ 
and will are ascribed to him, 1 Cor. ii. 
10, 11. 1 Cor. xii. 11. Eph. iv. 3. — 2. 
He is joined with tlie other two divine 
persons, as the object of worship and 
fountaiil of blessings, Mutt, xxviii. 19. 
2 Cor. xiii. 14. 1 John v. 7. — 3. In the 
Greek, a mascnline article or epithet is 
joined to his name Pneiuna, which is i 
naturally of the neuter gender, John 
xiv. 26. xv. 26. xvi. 13. Eph. i. 13.— 4. 
He appeared under the emblem of a 
dove, and of cloven tongues of fire, 
Matt. iii. Acts ii. — 5. Personal offices 
of an intercessor belong to him, Rom.' 
viii. 26. — 6. He is represented as per- 
forming a multitude of personal acts ; 
as teaching, speaking, witnessing, &amp;c. 
Mark xiii. 11. Acts xx. 23. Rom. viii. 
15, 16. 1 Cor. vi. 19. Acts xv. 28. xvi. 6, 
7, &amp;;c. &amp;c. &amp;:c. 

n. It is no less evident that the Holy 
Ghost is a dix'ine person equal in pow- 
er and glory with the Father and Son. 

1. Names proper only to the Most High 
God are ascribed to him ; as Jehovah, 
Acts xxviii. 25, with Is. vi. 9. and Heb. 
iii. 7, 9. with Exod. xyii. 7. Jer. xxxi. 
31, 34. Heb. x. 15, 16. God, Acts v. 
3, 4. Lord, 2 Cor. iii. \7, 19. "The 
I.,.ord, the S]nvit." — 2. Attributes pro- 
per only to the Most High (iod ai'e as- 
cribed to him ; as Omniscience, 1 Cor. 
ii. 10, 11. Is. xl. 13, 14. Omnipresence, 
ps. cxxxix. 7. I"i])h. ii. 17, 18. Rom. 
viii. 26, 27. Omnipotence, Luke i. 35. 
Eternity, Heb. ix. 14. — 3. Uivine works 
are evidently ascriljed to him, (ien. i. 

2. Job xxvi. 13. Ps. xxxiii. 6. Ps. civ. 
30. — 4. Worship, ])roper only to God, 
is requii-ed and ascribed to him, Is. vi. 3. 
Acts xxviii. 25. Rom. ix. 1. Rev. i. 4. 2 
Cor. xiii. 14. Matt, xxviii. 19. 

III. The agency or work of the Holy 
Ghost is divided by some into extraor- 
dinaiy and ordinary. The former by 
immediate insfiiration, muKing men 
firojihets, the latter by his regenerating 
and sanctifying influences nia/cing men 
sai?its. It is only the latter which is 
now to be e.r/iected. This is more par- 
ticularly d'vifilaxjed in' 1. Conviction of 
sin, John xvi. 8, 9. — 2. Conversion, 1 
Cor. xii. Eph. i. 17, 18. 1 Cor. ii. 10, 
12. John iii. 5, 6. — 3. Sanctification, 2 
Thess. ii. 13. 1 Coi". vi. 11. Rom. xv. 
16 — 4. Consolation, John xiv. 16, 26. — 
5. Direction, John xivi 17. Rom. viii. 14. 
— 6. Covfirniatioii, Rom. viii. 16, 26. 1 
John ii. 24. Eph. i. 13, 14. As to the 
gift of the Holy Spirit, says a good wri- 
_ tei*, it is not expected to be- bestowed in 
' answer to, our prayers, to inform us im- 



mediatel}', as by a whisper, when •ither 
awake or asleep, tliat wc are the chil- 
cli-en of God ; or in any other way, thiui 
Ijy enabling us to exercise repentance 
and faith and lo\ e to God and our neigh- 
bour. 2. We are not to suppose tluit he 
reveals any thing contrary to the writ- 
ten word, or more than is contained in 
it, or through any otlier medium. 3. We 
are not so led by, or operated upon by 
the Spirit as to neglect the means of 
grace. 4. The Holy Spirit is not pro- 
mised nor given to render us infallible. 
5. Nor is the Holy Spirit given in order 
that we may do any thing, which was 
not before our duty. See Trinity, and

HOLY GHOST, PROCESSION 
OF. See Prockssiojj. 

HOMILY, a sermon or discourse 
upon some point of religion delivered in 
a plain manner, so as to be easily un- 
derstood by the common ])eople. Tlie 
Greek homily, says M. Fleurj^, signifies 
a familiar discourse like the Latin ser- 
mo, and discourses delivered in the 
church toolv these denominations, to in- 
timate that they were not harangues, 
01' matters of ostentation and flourish, 
like those of profane orators, but fami- 
liar and useful discourses, as of a mas- 
ter to his disciples, or a father to his 
children. All the homilies of the Greek 
and " Latin fathers are composed by 
bishops. We h.ive none of 1 ertullian, 
Clemens Alexandrinus, and many other 
learned persons, because in the first 
ages none l)ut bishops were admitted to 
preach. The privilege was not ordina- 
rily allowed to priests till toward tlie 
fifth century. St. Chrysostom was the 
first presbyter that preached statedh', 
Origen and St. Augustine also preach- 
ed, but it was by a peculiar licence or 
privilege. 

Photius distinguislies homily from ser- 
mon, in that the homily was performed 
in a more familiar manner; the prelate 
interrogating and talking to the people, 
and they in their turn answering and 
interrogating him, so that it was pro- 
perly a •con\ersation ; wliereas the ser- 
mon was deli\'cred witli more form, and 
in the pulpit, after the manner of the 
orators. The practice of compiling 
homilies which were to be connnitted 
to .memorj', and recited b\- ignorant or 
indolent priests, commenced towards 
the close of the eighth century ; when

Chartemagne ordered Paul, Deacon, 
and Alcuin, to foiin homilies or discour- 
ses upon the Gospels and Epistles from 
the ancient doctors of the church. This 
gave I'ise to that famous collection enti- 
tled the Homiliarium of Charlemagne ; 
and which being followed as a model by 
many productions of the same kind, 
com.posed by private persons, from a 
principle of pious zeal, contributed 
much (says Mosheim) to nourish the 
indolence and to peipetuate the igno- 
rance of a worthless clergy. There 
are still extant several fine homilies 
composed by the ancient fathers, parti- 
cularly St. Chrysostom and St. Gregory. 
— The Clementine homilies are nineteen 
homilies in Greek, published by Cote- 
lerius, with two letters prefixed, one of 
them written in the name of Peter, the 
other in the name of Clement, to James, 
bishop of Jei-usalem ; in which last let- 
ter they are entitled Clement's Epitome 
of the Preaching and Tra\ els of Peter. 
According to Le Clerc, these homilies 
■were composed by an Ebionite, in the 
second century*; but Montfaucon sup- 
poses that they were forged long after 
the age of St. Athanasius. Dr. Lardner 
apprehends that the Clementine homi- 
lies were the original or first edition of 
the Recognitions ; and that they are the 
same with the -^vork censured by Euse- 
bius under the title of Dialogues of Peter 
and Appion. — Homilies of the Church 
of F.n gland are those which were com- 
posed at the reformation to be read in 
churches, in order to supply the defect 
of sermons. See the quarto edition of 
the Homilies, Avith notes, by a diA^ne of 
t he church of England. 

HONESTY is that principle which 
)iiakes a person prefer his promise or 
duty to his passion or interest. See 
Justice. 

HONOUR, a testimony of esteem or 
submission, expressed by words and an 
exterior behaviour, by which we make 
known the veneration and respect we 
entertain for any one, on account of his 
dignity or merit. The word is also used 
in general for the esteem due to virtue, 
glory, i-eputation, and probity; as also 
for an exactness in performing whatever 
we have promised ; and in this last 
sense we use the term, a man of ho- 
nour. It is also applied to two different 
kinds of virtue ; bravery in men, and 
chastity in women. In every situation 
of life, religion only forms the true 
konour and happiness of man. " It 
cannot," as one obsei-ves, "arise from 
inches, dignity of rank or office, nor 
from what are often called splendid ac- 
tioris of heroes, or civil accomplish- { 



ments ; these may be found among men 
of no real integrity, and mav create con- 
siderable fame ; but a distinction must 
be made between fame and time honour 
The former is a loud and noisy applause ; 
the latter a more silent and internal ho- 
mage. Fame floats on the breath of the 
multitude ; honour rests on the judg- 
ment of the thinking. In order, then, 
to discern where true honour lies, we 
must not look to any adventitious cir- 
cumstance, not to any single sparkling 
quality, but to the whole of what forms 
a man ; in a word, we must look to the 
soul. It will discover itself by a mind 
superior to fear, to selfish interest, and 
ct)rruption ; by an ardent love to the 
Supreme Being, and by a principle of 
uniform rectitude. It will make us nei- 
ther afraid nor ashamed to discharge 
our duty, as it relates both to God and 
man. It will influence us to be magnan- 
imous without being pix)ud ; humble 
without being mean ; just without being 
harsh ; simple in our manners, but 
manl}' in our feelings. This honour, 
thus formed by religion, or the love of 
God, is more independent and more 
complete, than what can be acquired by 
any other means. It is productive of 
higher felicity, and will be commensu- 
rate with eternity itself; while that 
honour, so called, which arises from any 
other principle, will resemble the feeble 
and twinkling flame of a taper, which 
is often clouded by the. smoke it sends 
forth, but is always wasting, and soon 
dies totally away." Barrow^s Works,

HOPE is the desire of some good, 
attended with the possibility, at least of 
obtaining it ; and is enlivened with joy 
greater or less, according to the proba- 
bility there is of possessing the object 
of our hope. Scarce any passion seems 
to be more natural to man than hope ; 
and, considering the many troubles he 
is encompassed with, none is more ne- 
cessary ; for life, void of all hope, would 
be a heavy and spiritless thing, very 
little desirable, peHiaps hardly to be 
borne ; whereas hope infuses strength 
into the mind, and by so doing, lessens 
the burdens of life. If our condition be 
not the best in the world, yet we hope it 
will be better, and this helps us to .sup- 
port it with patience. The hope of the 
C'hri.stian is an expectation of all neces- 
sary good both in time and eternity, 
founded on the promises, i-elations, and 
perfections of God, and on the offices, 
righteousness, and intercession of Christ.

It is a compound of desire, expectation, 
patience, and joy, Rom. viii. 24, 25. It 
may be considered, 1. As pure, 1 John 
iii. 2, 3, as it is resident in that heart 
which is cleansed from sin.— 2. As good, 
2 Thess. ii. 16. (in distinction from the 
hope of the hypocrite) as deriving its 
origin from God, and centring in him. 
— 3. It is called lively, 1 Pet. i. 3, as it 
proceeds from spiritual life, and renders 
one active and livelv in good works. — 
4. It is courageous, Rom. v. 5. 1 Thess. 
V. 8. because it excites fortitude in all 
the troubles of life, and yields support in 
the hour of death, Prov. xiv. 32. — 5. 
Sure, Heb. vi. 19, because it will not 
disappoint us, and is fixed on a sure

HOPKINSIANS, so called from the 
Rev. Samuel Hopkins, D. D. an Ame- 
rican divine, who in his sermons and 
tracts has made 'several additions to the 
sentiments first advanced by the cele- 
brated Jonathan Edwai'ds, late presi- 
dent of New-Jersey College. 

The following is a summary of the 
distinguishing tenets of the Hopkinsians, 
together with a few of the reasons they 
bring forward in support of their senti- 
ments. 

1. That all true virtue, or real holi- 
ness, consists in disinterested benevo- 
lence. The object of benevolence is 
universal being, including God and all 
intelligent creatures. It wishes and 
seeks the good of every individual, so 
far as is consistent with the greatest good 
of the whole, which is comprised in the 
glory of God and the perfection and 
happiness of his kingdom. The law of 
God is the standard of all moral recti- 
tude or holiness. This is reduced into 
love to God, and our neighbour as our- 
selves ; and universal good-will compre- 
hends all the love to God, our neigh- 
bour, and ourselves, required in the di- 
\ine law, and therefore must be the 
^vhole of holy obedience. Let any seri- 
ovis person think what are the particu- 
lar liranches of time piety ; when he 
lias viewed each one by itself, he will 
find that disinterested friendly affections, 
is its distinguishing charactei'istic. For 
instance, all the holiness in pious fear, 
which distinguislies it from the fear of 
the wicked, consists in love. Again ; 
holv gratitude is nothing but good-will 
to God and'our neighbour, in which we 



ourselves are included ; and coiTespon- 
dent affection, excited by a view of the 
good-will and kindness of God. Uni- 
versal good-will also implies the whole 
of the duty we owe to our neighbour, for 
justice, tiaith, and faithfulness, are com- 
prised in universal benevolence ; so are 
temperance and chastity. For an un- 
due indulgence of our appetites and, 
passions is contrary to benevolence, as 
tending to hurt ourselves or others ; and 
so opposite to the general good, and the 
divine command, in which all the crime 
of such indulgence consists. In shoi't, 
all virtue is nothing but benevolence 
acted out in its proper nature and per- 
fection ; or love to God and our neigh- 
bour, made perfect in all its genuine 
exercises and expressions. 

II. Tliat all sin consists in selfishness. 
Bv this is meant an interested, selfish 
affection, by which a person sets him- 
self up as supreme, and the only object 
of regard ; and notliing is good or lovely 
in .his view, unless suited to promote his 
own private interest. This self-love is 
in its whole nature, and every degree of 
it, enmity against God : it is not subject 
to the law of God, and is the only af- 
fection tl^at can oppose it. It is the 
foundation of all spiritual blindness, and 
therefore the source of all the open 
idolatry in the heathen world, and false 
religion under the light of the Gospel ; 
all this is agreeable to that self-love 
which opposes God's true character. 
Under the influence of this principle, 
men depart from ti-uth ; it being itself 
the greatest practical lie in nature, as 
it sets up that which is comparatively 
nothing above universal existence. Self- 
love is the source of all profaneness and 
impiety in the world, and of all pride 
and ambition among men, which is 
nothing but selfishness, acted out in this 
particular way. This is tlie foundation 
of all covetousness and sensuality, as 
it blinds people's eyes, contracts their 
hearts, and sinks them down, so that 
they look upon earthly enjoyments as 
the greatest good. This is the source 
of all falsehood, injustice, and oppres- 
sion, as it excites mankind by undue 
methods to invade the . property of 
others. _ Self-lo\'e produces all the vio- 
lent passions ; envy, wrath, clamour, 
and evil speaking : and every thing con- 
trary to the divine law is briefly com- 
prehended in this fraitful source of all 
iniquity, self-love. 

III. That there are no promises of 
regenerating gi-ace made to the doings 
of the iinregenerate. For as far as men 
act from self-love, they act from a bad 
end r for those who have no true love to 



HOP

HOP 



find, really do no duty when tlicy atteiid 
on the externals of religion. And as 
tlie unregcnerate act from a selfish 
principle, they do nothing Avhich is com- 
manded : their impenitent doings are 
AvhoUy opposed to repentance and con- 
version ; therefore not implied in the 
command to repent, Sec: so far from 
this, they are altogether disobedient to 
tile command. Hence it ajjpears that 
there are no promises of salvation to 
the doings of the unregcnerate. 

IV. That the impotency of sinners, 
with respect to believing in Christ, is 
not natural, but moral ; for it is a plain 
dictate of common sense, that natural 
imjiossibility excludes all l:)lame. But 
an unwilliug'mind is universally consi- 
dered as a crime, and not as an excuse, 
and is the very thing wherein our wick- 
edness consists. That the impotence of 
the sinner is owing to a disaffection of 
heart, is evident from the premises of 
the Gospel. When any object of good 
is j)roposed and promised to us upon 
asking, it clearly evinces that there can 
be no impotence in us with respect to 
obtaining it, besides the disajiprobation 
of the will : and that inability which con- 
sists in disinclination, never renders anv" 
thing impro])erly the subject of precept 
o)' conmiand. 

\". That, in order to faith in Christ, a 
sinner must approve in his heart of tlie 
di\ inc conduct, even though God should 
cast him off for ever; which, however, 
neither implies lo\e of misery, nor ha- 
tred of happiness. For if the law is 
good, death is due to those wiio have 
broken it. The Judge of all the earth 
ciuinot but do right. It would bring 
e\ eiiasting reproach upon his govern- 
ment to spare us, considered merely as 
in ourselves. When this is felt in our 
hearts, and not till then, wc shall be 
pi'ejjared to look to tlie free grace of 
God, through the redemption which is 
in Christ, and to exercise faith in his 
lilood, ivho is set forth to be a profiitia- 
tion to declare GocPh righteousness, that 
he /night he just, caul yet he the just ifier 
of him who belicveth in Jesus. 

VI. That the infinitely wise and holy 
God has exerted his omnipotent power 
in such a manner as he purposed should 
be followed with the existence and en- 
trance of moral evil into the svstem. — 
For it must be admitted on all hands, 
that (iod has a perfect knowledge, 
fo3-esight, and view of all possible exis- 
tences and events. If that system and 
scene of operation, in which moral evil 
should never have existed, was actually 
preferred in the divine mind, certainly 
the Deity is iufniitely disappointed iii 



the issue of his own operations. Noth- 
ing can be more dishonourable to God- 
than to imagine that the system which 
is actually formed by the divine hand, *^ 
and which was made for his pleasure 
and glory, is yet not the fruit of wise 
contrivance and design. 

VII. That the introduction of sin is, 
upon the whole, for the general good. 
For the wisdom and power of the Deity 
are displayed in carrying on designs of 
the greatest good; and the existence of 
moral evil has undoubtedly occasioned 
a more full, ])ei'fect, and glorious disco- 
very of the infinite perfections of the di- 
vine nature, tiian could otherwise have 
been made to the view of creatures. If 
the extensive manifestations of the pui"e 
and holy nature of God, and his inhnite 
aversion to sin, and all his inherent per- 
fections, in their genuine fruits and ef- 
fects, is either itself the greatest good, 
or necessarily contains it, it must ne- 
cessarily follow that the introduction 
of sin is for the greatest good. 

VIII. That repentance is before faith 
in Christ. — By this is not intended, that 
repentance is before a speculative belief 
of the being and perfections of God, and 
of.the person and character of Christ ; 
but only that true repentance is pre- 
vious to a saving faith in Clirist, in 
which the believer is united to Clirist, 
and entitled to the benefits of his media- 
tion and atonement. That repentance 
is before faith in this sense, appears 
from several considerations. 1. As re- 
pentance and faith respect different ob- 
jects, so they are distinct exercises of 
the heart ; and therefore one not only 
mav, but must be prior to the other. — 
2. There may be genuine repentance of 
sin without faith in Christ, but there 
cannot be true faith in Christ without 
repentance of sin ; and since repentance 
is necessary in order to faith in Christ, 
it must necessarily be prior to faith in 
Christ. — 3. John the Baptist, Christ and 
his apostles, taught that repentance is 

'liefore faith. Jolin cried, Re/ient, for 
the ki)igdom of heaven is at hand ; inti- 
mating that true repentance was neces- 
sary in order to embrace tiie Gospel of. 
the kingdom. Christ commanded, Re- 
fient lie, and helievc the Gos/iel. And 
Paul preached re/tentajice toivard God, 
and faith toward our Lord Jesus 
Christ. 

IX. That though men became sinners 
by Adam, kccording to a divine con.sti- 
tution, yet they hare and are accoiuita- 
ble for no siiis but personal; for, 1. 
Adam's act, in eating the forbidden 
fruit, was not the act of his posterity ; 
therefore they did not sin at the same 



HOR 



223 



HOS 



time he did. — 2. The sinfuhiess of that \] predominant, it is denominated a fika- 



act could not be transfcrrfd to tlicni 
afterwards, liccans^ the sinfidness of an 
act can no more l)e transferred from 
one person to another tlian an act itself. 
— 3. Therefore Adam's act, in eating 
the forbidden fruit, was not the cauni', 
but onlv" the occcifiion of his jjosterity's 
being sinners, (iod was pleased to 
make a constitution, tliat, if Adam re- 
mained holy through his state of trial, 
his posterity sliould in consequence l)e 
holy also ; but if lie sinned, his posterity 
should in consequence be sinners like- 
wise. Adam sinned, and now (iod 
brings his posterity into the world sin- 
ners. By Adam's sin we are become 
sinners, notybr it ; his sin being only the 
occasion, not the cause of our conmiit- 
ting sins. 

X. That though believers are justified 
tfirough Christ's righteousness ; yet his 
righteousness is not tramftri-ed to them. 
For, 1. Pei'sonal righteousness can no 
more be transferred from one person to 
another, than personal sin. — 2. If Christ's 
personal righteousness were transferred 
to believers, tliey would be as perfectl) 



iug horror. Such a horror seizes us at 
the view of vast and hanging ])recipices, 
a tempestuous ocean, or wild and soli- 
tary places. This passion is the original 
of superstition, as a wise and well-tem- 
pered awe is of religion. Horror and 
terror seem almost to be svnonymous ; 
but the former, I think, refers more to 
what dingiists; the latter to that which 
alarms us. 

HCJSANNA, in the Hebrew ceremo- 
nies, a prayer which they rehearsed on 
the several days of the feast of taljer- 
nacles. It signifies, " save us. nov/ ;" or 
" save us, we pray." There sire divers of 
these hosaimas ; tfie Jews call them hos- 
channoth, i. e. hosannas. Some are re- 
hearsed on tlie fii-st day, others on the 
secoFid, 5cc. which they call hosanna of ' 
the first day, hosanna of the second day, 
&amp;c. Hosanna Rabba, or Grand Ho- 
sanna, is a name thev give to then* feast 
of tabernacles, which lasts eight davs ; 
because during the course thereof, tliev 
are tVequentlv calling for the assistance 
of God, the forgi\ encss of their sins, 
and his blessing on the new year ; and 



holy as Christ ; and so stand in no need L to that purpose thev make great use of 
of forgiveness. — 3. But believers are not jj the prayers aliove" mentioned. The 
conscious of ha\ing Christ's personal j' Jews also apply the terms hosanna 
righteousness, but feel and bewail mucli ! ruhba in a more i)eculiar mannei- to the 
indwelHng sin and corruption. — 4. Tiie seventh day of the feast of tabernacles, 
Scripture represents believers as re- j because they apply themselves more 
cei\ing only the benejits of Christ's j inuiiediately on tliat dav to in\ olce the 
righteousness in justihcation, or their ■ divine blessing, &amp;:c. " * . " 

being pardoned '' and accepted frj- j HOSPITALITY, kindness exercised 
Clirist's i-ighteousness' sake: and this in the entertainment of strangers. This 
is the proper Scripture notion of impu- j; virtue, we favX, is explicitly commanded 
tation. Jonatlian's i-ighteousness was l by, and makes a part of the morality of 
imputed to Mcphibosheth when David i the New Testament. Indeed, that re-

has a house to sleep in, but may be be- 
nevolent to strangers. — But there are 
persons of cei-tain characters and star 
tions, who are more especially obliged 
to it: as particularly magistrates and 
others m civil offices, who would forfeit 
vhe esteem of, the public, and greatly 
injure their usefulness, were they not to 
observe the rites of hospitality. Minis- 
ters also, and such Christians as are 
qualified by their particular offices in 
the church, and their affluent circum- 
stances, may be eminently useful in this 
way. The two grand virtues which 
ought to be studied by every one, in or- 
der that he may have it in his power to 
be hospitable, are, industry and econo- 
my. But it may be asked again, to 
whom is this duty to be practised ? The 
answer is, to strangers : but here it is 
necessary to observe, that the term 
strangers hath two acceptations. It is 
to be understood of travellers, or per- 
sons who come from* a distance, and 
with whom we have little or no ac- 
quaintance ; and more generally of all 
who are not of our house — strangers, as 
opposed to domestics. Hospitality is 
especially to be practised to the poor : 
they who have no houses of their own, 
or possess few of the conveniences of 
life, shquld occasionally be invited to 
our houses, and refreshed at our tables, 
Luke xiv. 13, 14. Hospitality also may 
be practised to those who are of the 
same (jliaracter and of the same com- 
munity with ourselves. As to the \'a- 
rious offices of hospitality, and the -man- 
ner in which they should be rendered, 
it must be observed, that the entertain- 
ments should be plentiful, fi-ngal, and 
cordial. Gen. xviii. 6. 8. John xii. 3. 
Luke XV. 17. The obligations to this 
duty arise from t\\e._/itness and reasona- 
bleness of it ; it brings its own reward. 
Acts XX. 35. It is expressly commaiid- 
ed by God, Lev. xxv. 35, 38. Luke 
xvi. 19. xiv. 13, 14. Rom. xii. Heb. 
xiii. 1, 2. 1 Pet. iv. 9. We have many 
striking examples of hospitality on di- 
vine record : Abraham, Geq. xviii. 1, 8. 
I^ot, Gen. xix. 1, 3. Job xxxi. 17, 22. 
Shunamite, 2 Kings iv. 8, 10. The hos- 
pitable man mentioned in Judges xix. 
16, 21. David, 2 Sam. vi. 19. Obadiah, 
1 Kings xviii. 4. Nehemiah, Neh. v. 17, 
18. Martha, Luke x. 38. Mary, Matt, 
xxvi. 6, 13. The primitive Christians, 
Acts ii. 45, 46. Priscilla and Aquila, 
Acts xviii. 26. Lydia, Acts xvi. 15, 6cc. 
&amp;c. Lastly, what should have a pow- 
erful effect on our minds, is the consi- 
deration of divine hospitality. — God is 
good to all, and his tender mercies are 
over all his works. His sun shines and 



his rain falls on the evil as well as the 
good. His vei-y enemies share of his 
bounty. He gives liberally to all men, 
and upbraids not; but especially we 
should remember the exceeding riches 
of his grace, in his kindness towards us 
through Christ Jesus. Let us lay all 
these consitlerations together, and then 
ask ourselves whether we can find it in 
our hearts to be selfish, parsimonious, 
and inhospitable *" 

HOST, in the church of Rome, a 
name given to the elements used in the 
eucharist, or rather to the consecrated 
wafer, which they pretend to offer up 
every day, as a new host or sacrifice for 
the sins of mankind. They pay adora- 
tion to the host upon a false presump- 
tion that the elements are no longer 
bread and wine, but transubstantiated 
into the real body and blood of Christ. 

See Transubstantiation. Pope 

Gregory IX. first decreed a bell to be 
rung, as the signal for the people to be- 
take themselves to the adoration of the 
host. The vessel wherein the hosts arc 
kept is called the cihory, being a large 
kind of covered chalice. 

HUGUENOTS, an appellation given 
by way of contempt to the reformed or 
protestant Calvinists of France. The 
name had its rise in 1560, but authors are 
not agreed as to the origin and occasion 
thereof. Some derive it fi'om the fol- 
lowing circumstance :-;-One of the gates 
of the city of Tours is called the gate of 
Eourgon, by corniption from feit Heu- 
gon, i. e. the late Hugon. Tliis Hugon 
was once count of Tours, according to 
Eginhardus in his life of Charles the 
Great, and to some other historians. 
He was, it seems, a very wicked man, 
who by his fierce and cruel temper 
made himself dreadful, so that after 
his death he was supposed to walk 
about in the night time, beating all those 
he met with: this tradition the judi- 
cious Thuanas has not scrupled to 
mention in his historv. Davila and 
other historians pretend that the nick- 
name of Hugtienots was first given to 
the French Protestants, because they 
used to meet in the night time in subter- 
raneous vaults near the gate of Hugon ; 
and what seems to countenance this 
opinion is, that they were first called by 
the name of Huguenots at this city of 
Tours. Others assign a more illustri- 
ous origin to this name, and say that 
the leaguers gave it to the reformed, be- 
cause they were for keeping the crown 
upon the head of the present line de- 
scended from ■ Hugh Cap^fi' whereas 
they were for giving it to the house of 
Guise, as descended from Charles the

Great. Others again derive it from a 
French and faulty pionunciation of the 
German word edignossen, signifying 
confedei-ates ; and originally applied to 
that vaJiant part of the city of Geneva, 
which entered into an alliance with the 
Swiss cantons, in order to maintain their 
liberties against the tyrannical attempts 
of Charles III. duke of Savoy. These 
• confederates were called Eignots ; 
whence Huguenots. The persecution 
which they ha^e undergone has scarce 
its parallel in the history of religion. 
During the reign of Charles IX. and on 
the 24th of August, 1572, happened the 
massacre of Bartholomew, when seven- 
ty thousand of them throughout France 
were butchered with circumstances of 
aggravated ciiieltv. See Persfxution. 
In 1598, Henry IV. passed the famous 
edict of Nantz, which secured to the 
Protestants the free exercise of their 
religion. This edict was revoked by 
Lewis XIV. their churches were then 
razed to the ground, their persons in- 
sulted by the soldiery, and, after the 
loss of innumerable lives, fifty thousand 
valuable members of society were dri- 
ven into exile. In Holland they built 
several places of worship, and had 
among them some distinguished preach- 
ers. Among others were Superville, 
Dumont, Dubosc, and the eloquent Sau- 
rin; the latter of whom, in one of his 
sermons (ser. 9. vol. v.) makes the fol- 
lowing fine apostrophe to that tyrant 
Lewis XIV. by whom they were driven 
into exile: "And thou, dreadful prince, 
whom I once honoured as my king, and 
whom I yet respect as a scoui-ge in the 
hand of Almighty God, thou also shalt 
have a part in my good wishes ! These 
provinces, which thou threatenest, but 
which the arm of the Lord protects ; 
this country, which thou fiUest with re- 
fugees, but fugitives animated with love ; 
those walls, which contain a thousand 
martyrs of thy making, but whom reli- 
gion renders victorious, all these yet re- 
sound benedictions in thy favour. God 
grant the fatal bandage that hides the 
truth from thine eyes may fall off! May 
God forget the rivers of blood with 
which thou hast deluged the earth, and 
which thy reign hath caused to be shed ! 
— May God blot out of his book the in- 
juries which thou hast done us; and 
while he rewards the sufferers, mav he 

Sai'don those who exposed us to suffer ! 
&gt;, may God, who hath made thee to 
us, and to the whole church, a minister 
of his judgments, make thee a dispenser 
of his favours — an administrator of his 
mercy !" 
HUMANITY, the exercise of tlie 



social and benevolent virtues ; a fellow- 
feeling for the distresses of another. 
It is properly called humanity, because 
there is little or nothing of it in brutes. 
The social affections are conceived by 
all to be more refined than the selfish. 
Sympathy and humanity are universally 
esteemed the finest temper of mind ; 
and for that reason the prevalence of 
the social affections in the progress of 
society is held to be a refinement of our 
nature. Kaims's El. of Crit. p. 104.

anity a System of Humanitij ; Pratt's

HUMILIATION OF CHRIST, is 

that state of meanness and disti'ess to 
which he voluntarilv descended, for the 
pui-pose of executing his mediatorial 
work. This appears, 1. In his birth. 
He was born of a vjoman — a sinful wo- 
man ; tliough he was without sin. Gal. 
iv. 4. A poor woman, Luke ii. 7, 24. 
In a poor country village, John i. 46. 
In a stable, an abject place, of a na- 
ture subject to infirmities, Heb. ii. 9. 
hunger, thirst, weariness, pain, &amp;c. — 2. 
In his circumstances, laid in a manger 
when he was born ; lived in obscurity 
for a long time ; probably worked at the 
trade of a carpenter ; had not a place 
where to lay his head ; and was oppress- 
ed with poverty while he went about 
preaching the Gospel. — 3. It appeared 
in his re/iutation : he was loaded with 
the most abusive railing and calumny. 
Is. liii. the most false accusations, Matt 
xxvi. 59, 67. and the most ignominious 
ridicule, Psal. xxii. 6. Matt. xxii. 68, 
John vii. 35. — 4. In his sotd he was of- 
ten tempted, Matt. iv. 1, &amp;c. Heb. ii.

reproaches cast on himself, and with 
the sins and miseries of others, Heb. xii.

face, and the fears and impressions of 
his'Avrath, Psal. xxii. 1. Luke xxii. 43.

crowned with thorns, received gall and 
vinegar to drink, and was crucified be-

HUMILITY, a disposition of mind 
wherein a person has a low opinion of 
himself and his advantages. It is a 
branch of internal worship, or of experi- 
mental religion and godliness. It is the 
effect of divine grace operating on the 
soul, and always characterises the true 
Christian. The heathen philosophers 
were so little acquainted with this vir- 
tue, that they had no name for it : what 
they meant by the word we use, was 
meanness and baseness of mhid. To 
consider this grace a little more parti- 
cularly, it may be obsen-ed, 1. That hu- 
mility does not oblige a man to wrong 
the truth, or himself, by entertaining a 
meaner or worse opinion of himself 
than he deserves. — 2. Nor does it oblige 
a man, right or wrong, to give every 
body else the preference to himself. 
A wise man cannot believe himself in- 
ferior to the ignoi-ant multitude ; nor the 
virtuous man that he is not so good as 
those whose lives are vicious. — 3. Nor 
docs it oblige a man to treat himself with 
contempt in his words or actions : it 
looks more like affectation than humility, 
when a man says such things in his own 
dispraise as others know, or he himself 
believes, to be false: audit is plain, also, 
that this is often done merely as a dait 
to catch the praises of others. Humility i 
consists, 1. In not attributing to ourselves j 
any excellence or good which we have ! 
not. — 2. In not over-i'ating any thing we ! 
do. — 3. In not taking an immoderate de- j 
light in ourselves. — 4. In not assuming j 
more of the praise of a quality or action 
than belongs to us. — 5. In an inward 
sense of our many imperfections and 
sins. — 6. In ascribing all we have and 
are to the grace of God. True humility 
will ex/iress itself, 1. By the modesty o"f 
our appearance. The humble man will 
consider his age, abilities, character, 
function, &amp;c. and act accordingly. — 3. 
By the modesty of our pursuits. We 
shall not aim at any thing above our 
strength, but prefer a good to a great 

name 3. It will express itself hiy the 

modesty of our convei-sation and beha- 
viour : we shall not be loquacious, obsti- 
nate, forward, envious, discontented, or 



ambitious. The advantages of humili- 
ty are numei-ous: 1. It is well pleasing 
to God, 1 Pet. iii. 4. — 2. It has great in- 
fluence on us in the performance of all 
other duties, praying, hearing, converse, 
&amp;c. — 3. It indicates that more grace 
shall be given, James iv. 6. Ps. xxv. 9. 
— 4. It presences the soul in gi'eat tran- 
quillity and contentment, Ps. Ixix. 32, 
33. — 5. It makes us patient and resign- 
ed under afflictions. Job i. 22. — 6. It en- 
ables us to exercise moderation in every 
thing. To obtain this excellent spirit 
we should remember, 1. The example 
of Christ, Phil. ii. 6, 7, 8.-2. That hea- 
ven is a place of humility. Rev. v. 8. — 3. 
That our sins are numerous, and deserve 
the greatest punishment. Lam. iii. 39. — 
4. That humility is the way to honour, 
Prov. xvi. 18.— 5. That the greatest 
promises of good are made to the hum- 
ble. Is. Ivii. 'l5. Ivi. 2. 1 Pet. v. 5. Ps.

HUSSITES, a party of reformers, 
the followers of John Huss. — John Huss, 
from whom the Hussites take their 
name, was born in a little village in Bo- 
hemia, called Huss, and lived at Prague 
in the highest reputation, both on ac- 
count of the sanctity of his manners and 
the purity of his doctrine. He was dis- 
tinguished by his uncommon erudition 
and eloquence ; and performed at the 
same time the functions of professor of 
divinity in the university, and of ordi- 
nary pastor in the church of that city. 
He adopted the sentiments of Wickliffe 
and the Waldenses ; and, in the year 
1407, began openly to oppose and preach 
against divers errors in doctrine, as well 
as corruptions in point of discipline, then 
reigning in the church. Huss likewise 
endeavoured to the utmost of his power 
to withdraw the university of Prague 
from the jurisdiction of Gregory XII. 
whom the king of Bohemia had hitherto 
acknowledged as the true and lawful 
head of the church. This occasioned 
a \'iolent quarrel between the incensed 
archbishop of Prague and the zealous 
reformer, which the latter inflamed and 
augmented from day to day, by his pa- 
thetic exclamations against the court of 
Rome, and the corruption that prevail- 
ed among the sacerdotal order. 

There were other circumstances that 
contributed to inflame the resentment 



HUS 



221 



HUS 



of the clergy against him. He adopted 
the philosophical opinions of the Real- 
ists, and vehemently opposed and even 
persecuted the Nominalists, whose 
number and influence were consider- 
able in the university of Prague. He 
also multiplied the number of his ene- 
mies in the year 1408, by procuring, 
through his own credit, a sentence in 
favour of the Bohemians, who disputed 
with the Germans concerning the num- 
ber of suffrages which their respective 
nations were entitled to in all matters 
that were caiTied by election in this 
university. In consequence of a decree 
obtained in favour of the former, which 
restored them to their constitutional 
right of three suffrages usurped by the 
latter, the Germans withdrew from 
Prague, and in the year 1409 founded a 
new academy at Leipsic. This event no 
sooner happened, than Huss began to 
inveigh, with greater freedom than he 
had done before, against the vices and 
corruptions of the clergy ; and to re- 
commend in a public manner the wri- 
tings and opinions of WicklifTe, as far as 
they related to the papal hiei-archy, the 
despotism of the court of Rome, and 
the corruption of the clerg}'. Hence an 
accusation was brought against him in 
the year 1410, before the tribunal of 
John XXni. by whom he was solemnly 
expelled from the communion of the 
church. Notwithstanding this sentence 
of excommunication, he proceeded to 
expose the Romish church with a for- 
titude and zeal that were almost uni- 
versally applauded. 

This eminent man, whose piety was 
equally sincere and fervent, though his 
zeal was perhaps too violent, and his 
pinidence not always circumspect, was 
summoned to appear before the council 
of Constance. Secured, as he thought, 
from the rage of his enemies, by the 
safe conduct granted him by the empe- 
ror Sigismund for his journey to Con- 
stance, his residence in that place, and 
his return to his own country, Jolin Huss 
obeyed the order of the council, and ap- 
peared before it to demonsti*ate his in- 
nocence, and to prove tliat tlie charge 
of his having deserted the church of 
Rome was entirely groundless. ' How- 
ever, his enemies so far prevailed, that, 
by the most scandalous breach of public 
faith, he was cast into prison, declared 
a heretic, because he refused to plead 
guilty against the dictates of his con- 
science, in obedience to the council, and 
bunit alive in 1415 ; a punishment 
which he endured with unparalleled 
magnanimity and resolution. When he 
came to the place of execution, he fell 



on his knees, sang portions of psalms, 
looked steadfastly towards heaven, and 
repeated these words : "Into thy hands, 

Lord, do I commit my spirit ; thou 
hast redeemed me, O most good and 
faithful God. Lord Jesus Christ, assist 
and help me, that with a firm and pre- 
sent mind, by thy most powerful grace 

1 may undergo this most cruel and igno- 
minious death, to which I am condemned 
for preaching the truth of thy most holy 
Gospel." When the chain was put 
upon him at the stake, he said with a 
smiling countenance, "My Lord Jesus 
Christ was bound with a harder chain 
than this for my sake, and why should I 
be ashamed of this old rusty one ?" 
When the faggots were piled up to his 
very neck, the duke of Bavaria was of- 
ficious enough to desire him to abjure. 
"No," says Huss, "I never preached 
any doctrme of an evil tendency ; and 
what I taught with my lips, I seal with 
my blood." He said to the executioner, 
"Are you going to bui-n a goose.*' In 
one century you will have a siuan you 
can neither roast nor boil." If he wei'e 
prophetic, he must have meant Luther, 
who had a swan for his arms. The fire 
was then applied to the faggots ; when 
the martyr sang a hymn with so loud 
and cheerful a voice, that he was heard 
through all the cracklings of the com- 
bustibles and the noise of the multitude. 
At last his voice was cut short, after he 
had uttered, " Jesus Christ, thou Son of 
the liAing God, have mercy upon me." 
.and he was consumed in a most misera- 
ble manner. The duke of Bavaria or- 
dered the executioner to throw all the 
martyr's clothes into the flames : after 
which his ashes were carefully collect- 
ed, and cast into the Rhine. 

But the cause in wliich this eminent 
man was engaged did not die with him. 
His disciples adhered to their master's 
doctrines after his death, which broke 
out into an open war. John Ziska, a 
Bohemian knight, in 1420, put himself 
at the head of the Hussites, who were 
now become a very considerable party, 
and threw off the despotic yoke of Sigis- 
niund, who had treated tlieir brethren 
in the most barbarous manner. Ziska 
was succeeded by Procopius in the year 
1424. Acts of barbarity were committed 
on both sides ; for notwithstanding the 
irreconcileable opposition between the 
religious sentiments of the contending 
parties, they both agreed in this one 
horrible principle, that it was innocent 
and lawful to ])ersccute and extirpate 
with fire and sword the enemies ot the 
true religion ; and such they recipro- 
cally appeared to each other. These

commotions in a great measure subsided 
by the interference of the council of Ba-

The Hussites, who were divided into 
two parties, viz. the Calixtines and the 
Taborites, spi-ead over all Bohemia, and 
Hungary, and even Silesia and Poland ;

HUTCHINSONIANS,the followers 
of John Hutchinson, who was born in 
Yorkshire in 1674. In the early part of 
his life he served the duke of Somerset 
in the capacity of steward ; and in the 
course of liis travels from place to place 
employed himself in collecting fossils. 
A\'e are told that the large and noble 
collection bequeathed by Dr. Woodward 
to the University of Cambridge was ac- 
tually made by him, and even unfairly 
obtained from him. In 1724, he pub- 
lished the first part of his curious book, 
called Moaes^s Princi/iia, in which he 
ridiculed Dr. Woodward's Natural His- 
torv of the Earth, and exploded the 
doctrine of gravitation established in 
Newton's Principia. In 1727, he pub- 
lished a second pail of Moses's Prin- 
ci])ia, containing the principles of the 
Scripture philosophy. From this time 
to his death he published a volume 
ever}' year or two, which, with the 
manuscripts he left behind, wei-e pub- 
lished in 1748, in 12 volumes, 8vo. On 
the Monday before his death. Dr. Mead 
ni-ged him to be bled ; saying, pleasant- 
ly, "I will soon send you to Moses," 
meaning his studies ; but Mr. Hutchin- 
son taking it in the literal sense, an- 
SAvered in a muttering tone, " I believe, 
doctor, you will ;" and was so displeas- 
ed, that he dismissed him for another 
phvsician ; but he died in a few days 
after, August 28, 1737. 

It appears to be a leading sentiment 
of this denomination, that all our ideas 
of divinity are formed from the ideas in 
nature, — that nature is a standing pic- 
ture, and Scripture an application of the 
sevei'al parts of the picture, to draw out 
to, as the great things of Ciod, in order 
to reform our mental conceptions. To 
prove this point, they allege, that the 
Scriptures declare the invisible things 
of God from the formation of the nvorld 
are clearly seen, being imderstood by 
the things which are made; even his 
eternal power a7jd Godhead, Rom. i. 20._ 
The heavens must declare God^s righ- 
teousness and truth in the congregation 
of the saints, Psal. Ixxxix. 5. And in 
short the whole system of nature, in one 
voice of analogy, declares and gives us 



ideas of his glorv, and shows us his 
handy-work. We cannot have any 
ideas of invisible things till they are 
pointed out to us by revelation : and as 
we cannot know them immediately, 
such as they are in themselves, after 
the manner in which we know sensible 
objects, they must be communicated to 
us by the mediation of such things as we 
already comprehend. For this reason 
the Scripture is found to have a lan- 
guage of its own, which does not consist 
of words, but of signs or figures taken 
from visible things : in consequence of 
which the world which we now see be- 
comes a sort of commentary on the 
mind of God, and explains the world in 
which we believe. The doctrines of tlie 
Christian faith are attested by the whole 
natural world : they are recorded in a 
language which has never been con- 
founded ; they are written in a text 
wliich shall never be corrupted. 

The Hutchinsonians maintain that the 
great mystery of the trinity is conveyed 
to our understandings by ideas of sense ; 
and that the created substance of the 
air, or heaven, in its three-fold agency 
of fire, light, and spirit, is the enigma of 
the one essence or one Jehovah in three 
persons. The unity of essence is exhi- 
bited by its unity of substance ; the tri- 
nity of conditions, fire, hght, and spirit. 
Thus the one substance of the air, or 
heaven in its three conditions, shows the ' 
unity in trinity ; and its three conditions 
in or of one substance, the trinity in 
unity. For (says this denomination) if 
we consult the writings of the Old and 
New Testament, we shall find the per- 
sons of the Deity represented under the 
names and characters of the three ma- 
terial agents, fire, light, and spirit, and 
their actions expressed bv tlie actions 
of these their emblems. The Father is 
called a consuming fire ; and his judicial 
proceedings ai'e spoken of in words 
which denote the several actions of fire, 
Jehovah is a consuming fire — Our God 
is a consumint^ fire, Deut. iv. 24. Heb. 
xii. 29. The Son lias the name of light, 
and his purifying actions and offices are 
described by words which denote the 
actions and offices of light. He is the 
true ligfit,vjhich lighteth every man that 
Cometh into the world, John i. 9. Mai. 
iv. 2. The Comforter has the name of 
Spirit ; and his animating and sustaining 
offices are desci'ibed by words, for the 
actions and offices of the material spirit. 
His actions in the spii-itual economy are 
agreeable to his type in the natural 
economy ; such as "inspiring, impelling, 
drmng,' leading, Matt. ii. 1. The phi- 
) losophic system of the Hutchinsonians

HYP 



is derived from the Hebrew Scriptures. 
The truth of it rests on these supposi- 
tions. 1. That the Hebrew language 
was formed under divine inspiration, 
either all at once, or at different times, 
as occasion required ; and that the Di- 
vine Being had a view in constructing 
it, to the various revelations which he 
in all succeeding times should make m 
that language: consequently, that its 
words must be the most pi'o]jer and de- 
terminate to convey such trutlis as the 
Deity, during the Old Testament dis- 
pensation, thought fit to make known to 
the sons of men. Farther than this: 
that the inspired penmen of those ages 
at least were under the guidance of 
heaven in the choice of words for re- 
cording what was revealed to them : 
therefore that the Old Testament, if 
the language be rightly understood, is 
the most determinate in its meaning of 
any other book under heaven. — 2. That 
whatever is recorded in the Old Testa- 
ment is strictly and literally true, al- 
lowing only for a few common figures 
of rhetoric : that nothing contrarj' to 
truth is accommodated to vulgar ap- 
pi-ehensions. 

In proof of this the Hutchinsonians 
argue in this manner. The primaiy 
and ultimate design of revelation is in- 
deed to teach men divinity ; but in sub- 
serviency to that, geography, history, 
and chronology, are occa.sionally intro- 
duced ; all which are allowed to be just 
and authentic. There are also innume- 
rable references to things .of nature, and 
descriptions of them. If, then, the for- 
mer are just, and to be depended on, 
for the same reason the latter ought to 
be esteemed philosophically true. Far- 
ther: they think it not unworthy of 
God, that he shoidd make it a secondary 
end of his revelation to unfold the se- 
crets of his works ; as the primary was 
to make known the mysteries of his na- 
ture, and the designs of his grace, that 
men might thereby be led to admire and 
adore the wisdom and goodness which 
the great Author of the universe has 
displayed throughout all his works. And 
as our minds are often referred to na- 
tural things for ideas of spiritual truths, 
it is of great importance, in order to 
conceive aright of divine matters, that 
our ideas of the natural things referred 
to be strictly just and tnie. 

Mr. Hutchinson found that the He- 
brew Scriptures had some capital words, 
which he thought had not been duly 
considered and understood ; and whicli, 
he has endeavoured to ])rove, contain in 
their radical meaning the greatest and 
most comfortable ti-utl^. The cheru- 



bim he explains to be a hieroglyphic of 
divine constraction, or a sacred image, 
to dcscrilje, as far as figures could go, 
the humanity united to Deity : and ■ so 
he treats of several other words of si- 
milar import. From all which he con- 
cluded, that the rites and ceremonies of 
the Jewish dispensation were so many 
delineations oi Christ, in what he was 
to be, to do, and to suffer; that the 
early Jews knew them to be types of 
his actions and sufferings ; and, by per- 
forming them as such, were so far 
Christians l)oth in faith and practice. 

The Hutchinsonians have, for the 
most part, been men of devout minds, 
zealous in the cause of Christianity, 
and untainted with heterodox opinions, 
which liaAe so often divided the church 
of Christ. The names of Romaine, Bi- 
shop Home, Parkhurst, and others of 
this denomination, \vill be long esteemed, 
both for the piety they possessed, and 
the good they have been the instru- 
ments of promoting amongst mankind. —

HYMN, a song or ode in honour of 
th.e Divine Being. St. Hilary, bishop of 
Poictiers, is said to have been the first 
who composed hymns to be sung in 
churches, and was followed by St. Am- 
brose. Most of those in the Roman 
breviary were composed by Prudentius. 
The hymns or odes of the ancients ge- 
nerally consisted of three sorts of stan- 
zas, one of which was sung by the band 
as they walked from east to west ; ano- 
ther was performed as they returned 
from west to east ; the third part was 
sung before tlie altar. The Jewish 
hymns were accompanied with trum- 
pets, dnims, and cymbals, to assist the. 
voices of the Levites and the people. 
We have had a considerable number of 
hvmns composed in our own countn% 
The most esteemed al-e those of "Watts,. 
Doddridge, Newton, and Hait. As to 
selections, few are superior to Dr. 
Rippon's and Dr. Williams's. See 
Psalmody. 

HYPOCRISY is a seeming or pro- 
fessing to be what in truth and reality 
we are not. It consists in assuming a 
character which we are conscious does 
not belong to us, and by wliich we in- 
tentionally impose upon the judgment 
and opinion of mankind concerning us. 



JAC 



230 



JAN 



Ihe name is borrowed from the Greek 
tongue, in which it primarily signifies 
the profession of a stage player, which 
is to express in speech, habit, and ac- 
tion, not his own person and manners, 
but his whom he undertakes to repre- 
.sent. And so it is; for the very essence 
of hypocrisy lies in apt imitation and de- 
ceit; in acting the part of a member of 
Christ without any saving grace. The 
hypocrite is a double person ; he has 
one pereon, which is natural ; another, 
■which is artificial: the first he keeps to 
himself; the other he puts on as he 
doth his clothes, to make his appear- 
ance in before men. It was ingeniouslj^ 
said by Basil, " that the hypocrite has 
not put off the old man, but put on the 
new upon it." Hypocrites have been 
divided into four sorts. 1. The worldly 
hypocrite, who makes a profession of 
religion, and pretends to be religious, 
merely from wm-ldly considerations. 
Matt, xxiii. 5. — 2. The legal hypocrite, 
who relinquishes his vicious practices, 
in order thereby to merit hea\en, while 
at the same time he has no real love to 
God, Rom. X. 3. — 3. The evangelical 
hypt&gt;crite, whose religion is nothing 
more than a l^are con\iction of sin ; who 
rejoices under the idea that Christ died 
for him, and vet has no desire to live a 
holy life. Matt. x':ii. 20. 2 Pet. ii. 20.— 4. 
The eiithnsiafitic hypocrite, who has an 
imaginary sight of his sin, and of Christ ; 
talks of remarkal)le impulses and high 
feelings ; and thinks himself very wise 
and good while he lives in the most 
scandalous practices. Matt. xiii. 39. 2

HYPOSTASES, a term literally sig- 



nifying substance or subsistence, or that 
which is put and stands luider another 
thing, and supports it, being Its base, 
ground, or foundation. Thus faith is 
the substantial foundation of things 
hoped for, Heb. xi. 1. The word is 
Greek, uffoo-Taais, compounded of im, 
sub, under; and I'trrriK^i, " sto," I stand, 

1 exist, q. d. " subsistentia." It likewise 
signifies confidence, stability, firmness, 

2 Cor. ix. 4. It is also used for person, 
Heb. i. 3. Thus we hold that there is 
but one nature or essence in God, but 
three hypostases or persons. The word 
has occasioned great dissensions in the 
ancient church, first among the Greeks, 
and afterwards among the Latins ; but 
an end was put to them by a synod h£ld 
at Alexandria about the year 362, at 
which St. Athanasius assisted; from 
which time the Latins made no great 
scruple of saying three hypostases, nor 
the Greek of three persons. The hy~ 
postatical union is the union of the hu- 
man nature of Christ with the divine : 
constituting two natures in one person, 
and not two persons in one nature, as 
the Ncstorians believe. See Jesus 
Christ. 

H YPSISTARII, (formed from J^^,o•T05, 
" highest,") a sect of heretics in the 
fourth century ; thus called from the 
profession they made of worshipping 
the Most High God. 

The doctrine of the Hypsistarians 
was an assemblage of Paganism, Juda- 
ism, and Christianity. — They adored 
the Most High God with the Christians; 
but they also revered fii'e and lamps 
with the Heathens, and observed the 
sabbath, and the distinction of clean and 
unclean things, with the Jews. The 
Hj'psistarii bore a near resemblance to 
the Euchites, or Messalians. 



I&amp;J. 



JACOBITES, a sect of Christians in 
Syi'ia and Mesopotamia ; so called, 
■either from Jacob, a Syrian, who lived 
in the reign of the empei'or Mauritius, 
or from one Jacob, a monk, who flou- 
rished in the year 550. 

The Jacobites are of two sects, some 
following the rites of the Latin church, 
and others continuing separated from 
the church of Rome. There is also a 
d^-'sion among the latter, who have two 
rival patriarchs. As to their belief, 
they hold but one nature in Jesus Christ: 



with respect to purgatoiy, and prayers 
for the dead, they are of the same opi- 
nion with the Greeks and other eastern 
Christians. They consecrate unleaven- 
ed bread at the eucharist, and are 
against confession, believing that it is 
not of divine ijistitution. 

JANSENISTS, a sect of the Roman 
Catholics in France who followed the 
opinions, of Jansenius (bishop of Ypres, 
and doctor of divinity of the universities 
of Lou&gt;'ain and Douay,) in relatioa to 
grace and predestination.

In the year 1640, the two universities 
just mentioned, and particularly father 
Molina and father Leonard Celsus, 
thought fit to condemn the opinions of 
the Jesuits on grace and fi'ee will. 
This having set the controversy on foot, 
Jansenius opposed to the doctrine of the 
Jesuits the sentiments of St. Augiistine, 
and wrote a treatise on grace which he 
entitled jlugiistinus. This treatise was 
attacked by the Jesuits, who accused 
Jansenius of maintaining dangerous and 
heretical opinions ; and afterwards, in 
1642, obtained of Pope Urban VIII. a 
formal condenmation of the treatise 
wrote by Jansenius ; when the partisans 
of Jansenius gave out that this bull was 
spurious, and composed by a ])erson en- 
tirely devoted to the Jesuits. After the 
death of Urban VIII. the affair of Jan- 
senism began to be more warmly con- 
troverted, and gave birth to a great 
number of polemical writings concern- 
ing grace ; and what occasioned some 
mirth, were tlie titles which each party 
gave to their writings : one writer pub- 
lished the Torch of St. Augustine ; 
another found STTuJp'rs of St. Aiigiis- 
tine^s Torch; and father Veron formed 
A Gag for the Jansenists, Sec. In the 
year 1650, sixty-eight bishops of France 
subscribed a letter to pope Innocent X. 
to obtain an inquiry into and condemna- 
tion of the five following propositions, 
extracted from Jansenius's Augustinus : 

1. Some of God's commandments are 
impossible to be observed by the righ- 
.teous, even though they endeavour with 
all their power to accomplish them. — 

2. In the state of corrupted nature, we 
are incapable of resisting inward grace. 
— 3. Merit and demerit, in a state of 
connipted nature, do not depend on a 
liberty which excludes necessitv, but on 
a liberty which excludes constraint. — 4. 
The Semi-pelagians admitted the ne- 
cessity of an inward preventing grace 
for the performance of each particular 
act, even for the beginning of faith; 
but they were heretics in maintaining 
that this grace was of such a nature that 
the will of man was able either to re- 
sist or obey it. — 5. It is Semi-pelagian- 
ism to say, that Jesus Christ died, or 
shed his felood, for all mankind in ge- 
neral. 

In the year 1652, the pope appointed 
a congregation for examining into the 
dispute relative to grace. In this con- 
gregation Jansenius was condemned ; 
and the bull of condemnation published 
in May, 1653, filled all the pulpits in 
Paris with violent outcries and alarms 
against the Jansenists. In the year 1656, 
• pope Alexander VII. issued out another 



bull, in which he condemned the five 
propositions of Jansenius. However, the 
Jansenists affirmed that these proposi- 
tions Avere not to be found in this book ; 
but that some of his enemies having 
caused them to be printed on a sheet, 
inserted them in the book, and thereby 
deceived the pope. At last Clement 
I XI. put an end to the dispute by his con- 
stitution of July 17, 1705, in which, after 
having recited the constitutions of his 
predecessors in relation to this affaii-, he 
declared, "That, in order to pay a 
proper obedience to the papal constitu- 
tions conceniing the present question, 
it is necessary to receive them with a 
respectful silence." The clergy of Pa- 
ris, the same year, approved and ac- 
cepted this l)ull, and none dared to op- 
pose it. This is the famous bull Uni- 
genitus, so called from its beginning 
with the words, Unigenitus Dei Filius, 
&amp;c. which has occasioned so mucli con- 
fusion in France. 

It was not only on accovmt of their 
embracing the doctrines of Augustine, 
that the Jesuits were so imbittered 
against them ; but that which offended 
the Jesuits, and the other creatures of 
the Roman pontiff, was, their strict 
piety, and severe moral discipline. The 
Jansenists cried out against the corrup- 
tions of the church of Rome, and com- 
plained that neither its doctrines nor 
morals retained any traces of their for- 
mer purity. They repi-oached the clergy 
witli an universal depravation of senti- 
ments and manners, and an entire for- 
getfulness of the dignity of their clia- 
racter and the duties of their vocation ; 
they censured the licentiousness of the 
monastic orders, and insisted upon the 
necessity of reforming their discipline 
according to the rules of sanctity, ab- 
stinence, and self-denial, that were ori- 
ginally prescribed by their respecti\c 
founders. They maintained, also, that 
the people ought to be carefully in- 
structed in all the doctrines and pre- 
cepts of Christianity; and that, for this 
liurpose, the Holy Scriptures and pub- 
lic liturgies should be offered to their 
pei-usal in their mother tongue ; and, 
finally, they looked upon it as a matter 
of the highest moment to persuade all 
Christians that true piety did not con- 
sist in the observance of pompous rites, 
or in the performance of external acts 
of devotion, but in inward holiness and 
divine love. 

Notwithstanding the above-mentioned 
sentiments, the Jansenists have been 
accused of superstition and fanaticism ; 
and, on account of their severe disci- 
plbie and practice, have been denomi

nated Pigonrists. It is said, that they 
made repentance consist chiefly in those 
voluntary sufferings which the trans- 
gressor inflicted upon himself, in pro- 
portion to the nature of his crimes and 
thp degree of his guilt. They tortured 
and macerated their bodies by painful 
labour, excessive abstinence, continual 
praver, and contemplation: nay, they 
carried these austerities, it is said, to so 
high a pitch, as to place merit in them, 
and to consider those as the sacred vic- 
tims of rf/inita?ice who had gradually 
put aii end to their days by their exces- 
sive abstinence and labour. Dr. Haweis, 
however, in his Church History, (vol. 
iii. p. 46,) seems to form a more favour- 
able opinion of them. " I do not," says 
be, "readily receive the accusations 
that Papists or Protestants have object- 
ed to them, EVS over rigorous and fana- 
tic in their devotion ; but I will admit 
many things might be blameable : a 
tincture of popery might drive them to 
push monkish austerities too far, and 
secretly to place some merit in mortifi- 
cation, which tliey in general disclaim- 
ed ; yet, with all that can be said, surely 
the root of the matter was in them. 
When I read Jansenius, or his disciples 
Pascal or Quesnel, I bow before such 
distinguished excellencies, and confess 
them'mv brethren ; shall I say my fa- 
thers.'' Their pi-inciples are pure and 
evangelical ; their morals formed upon 
the apostles and prophets; and their 
zeal to amend and convert, blessed with 
eminent success." 

IBERIANS, a denomination of east- 
em Christians, which derive their name 
from Iberia, a province of Asia now 
called Georgia: hence they ai-e also 
called Georgians. Their tenets are said 
to be the same with those of the Greek 
church ; which see. 

ICONOCLASTES, or Iconoclas- 
TM, breakers of images : a name which 
the church of Rome gives to all who re- 
ject the use of images in religious mat- 
ters. The word is Greek, formed from 
tixtov imago, and xXafrmv rump.ere, "to 
break." In this sense not only the re- 
formed, but some of the eastern church- 
es, are called iconoclastes, and esteemed 
by them heretics, as opposing the wor- 
ship of the images of God and the saints, 
and breaking their figures and repre- 
sentations in churches. 

The opposition to images began in 
Greece, under the reign of Bardanes, 
who was created emperor of the Greeks 
a little after the commencement of the 
eighth century, when the worship of 
them became common. See Image. But 
the tumults occasioned by it were quell- 



ed by a revolution, which, in 713, de- 
prived Bardanes of the imperial throne. 
The dispute, however, broke out with 
redoubled fury under Leo the I saurian, 
who issued out an edict in the year 726, 
abrogating, as some say, the worship of 
images ; and ordering all the images, 
except that of Christ's crucifixion, to be 
removed out of the churches ; but, ac- 
cording to others, this edict only pro- 
hibiting the paying to them any kind of 
adoration or worship. This edict occa- 
sioned a civil war, which broke out in 
the islands of the Archipelago, and, by 
the suggestions of the priests and monks, 
ravaged a part of Asia, and afterwards 
reached Italy. The civil commotions 
and insurrections in Italy were chiefly- 
promoted bv the Roman pontiffs, Gre- 
gory I. and II. Leo was excommunica- 
ted ; and his subjects in the Italian pro- 
vinces violated their allegiance, and 
rising in arms, either massacred or 
banished all the emperor's deputies and 
officers. In consequence of these pro- 
ceedings, Leo assembled a council at 
Constantinople iii 730, which degraded 
Germanus, bishop of that city, who was 
a patron of images ; and he ordered all. 
the images to be publicly burnt, and in- 
flicted a variety of severe punishments 
upon such as were attached to that ido- 
latrous worship. Hence arose two fac- 
tions, one of which adopted the adora- 
tion and worship of images, and on that 
account were called iconoduli or inco- 
nokitree; and the other maintained that 
such worship was unlawful, and that 
nothing was more worthy the zeal of 
Christians than to demolish and destroy 
those statues and pictures which were 
the occasion of this gross idolatry ; and 
hence they were distinguished by the 
titles of icono-machi (from tixuv image, 
and (laxto, I contend) and ico?ioclastse. 
The zeal of Gregory II. in favour of 
image worship was not only irritated, 
but even surpassed, by his successor 
Gregory III. m consequence of which 
the Italian provinces were torn from the 
Grecian empire. Constantine, called 
Copronimus, in 754, convened a council 
at Constantinople, regarded by the 
Greeks as the seventh oecumenical 
council, which solemnly condemned the 
worship and use of images. Those who, 
notwithstanding this decree of the coun- 
cil, raised commotions in the state, were 
severely punished, and new laws were 
enacted to set bounds to the violence of 
monastic rage. Leo IV. who was decla- 
red emperor in 775, pursued the same 
measures, and had recourse to the coer- 
cive influence of penal laws, in order to 
extirpate idolatry out of the Christian

church. Irene, the wife of Leo, poison- 
ed her husband in 780; assumed the 
reins of the empire during the'minority 
of her son Constantine ; and in 786 sum- 
moned a council at Nice, in Bithynia, 
known by the name of the Second JVi- 
cene Council, which abrogated the laws 
and decrees against the new idolatiy, 
restored the worship of images and of 
the cross, and denounced severe punish- 
ments against those who maintained that 
God was the only object of religious ado- 
ration. In thjs contest tlie Britons, Ger- 
mans, and Gauls, were of opinion that 
images might be lawfully continued in 
churches ; but they considered the wor- 
ship of them as highly injurious and of- 
fensive to the Supreme Being. Charle- 
magne distinguished himself as a media- 
tor in this controversy : he ordered four 
books concei-ning images to be compo- 
sed, refuting the reasons urged by the 
Nicene bishops to justify the worship of 
images, which he sent to Adrian, the 
Romj-u pontiff, in 790, in order to en- 
gage him to withdraw his approbation 
of the decrees of the last council of Nice. 
Adrian wrote an answer ; and in 794 a 
council of 300 bishops, assembled by 
Charlemagne, at Francfort, on tlie 
Maine, confirmed the opinion contained 
in the four books, and solemnly con- 
demned the worship of images. 

In the Greek church, after the banish- 
ment of Irene, the controversy concern- 
ing images bi'oke out anew, and was car- 
ried on by the contending parties, during 
the half of the ninth century, with vari- 
ous and uncertain success. The empe- 
ror Nicephorus appears iipon the whole 
to have been an enemy to this idolatrous 
woi'ship. His successor, Michael Curo- 
palates, surnamed lihans^abe, patroni- 
zed and encouraged it. But the scene 
changed on the accession of Leo, the 
Armenian, to the empire, who assem- 
bled a council at Constantinople, in 812, 
that abolished the decrees of the Nicene 
council. His successor, Michael, sur- 
named Balbus, disapproved of the wor- 
ship of images, and his son Theophilus, 
treated them with great severity. How- 
ever, the empress Theodora, after his 
death, and during the minority of her 
son, assembled a council at Constantino- 
ple in 842, which reinstated the decrees 
of the second Nicene council, and en- 
couraged image worship by a law. The 
council held at the same place under 
Protius, in 879, and reckoned by the 
Gi-eeks the eighth general council, con- 
firmed and renewed the Nicene de- 
crees. In commemoration of this coun- 
cil, a festival was instituted by the su- 
perstitious Greeks, called the' Feofit of 



Orthodoxy. The Latins were generally 
of opinion that images might be suffer- 
ed, as the means of aiding the memory 
of the faithful, and of calling to their re- 
membrance the pious exploits and vir- 
tuous actions of the persons whom thev" 
represented ; but they detested all 
thoughts of paying them the least marks 
of religious homage or adoration. The 
council of Paris assembled in 824 liy 
Louis the Meek, resolved to allow the 
use of images in the churches, but se- 
verely prohibited rendering them reli- 
gious worship : nevertheless, towards 
the conclusion of this century, the Gal- 
ilean clergy began to pay a tind of re- 
ligious homage to the images of saints, 
and their example was followed by the 
Germans and other nations. However, 
the Iconoclastes still had their adherents 
among the Latins ; the most eminent of 
whom was Claudius, bishop of Turin, 
who, in 823, oidered all images, and 
even the crosses to be cast out of the 
churches, and committed to tlie flames; 
and he wrote a treatise, in which he de- 
clared botli against the use and worship 
of them. He condemned relics, pilgrim- 
ages to the Holy Land, and all voyages 
to the tombs of saints ; and to his wri- 
ting and labours it was owing, that the 
city of Turin, and the adjacent country, 
was, for a long time after his death, 
much less infected with superstition 
than the other parts of Europe. The 
coHtro\ersy concerning the sanctity of 
images was again revived by Leo, bishop 
of Chalcedon : in the 11th century, on 
occasion of the emperor Alexius's con- 
verting the figures of silver that adorned 
the portals ot the churches into money, 
in order to supply the exigencies of the 
state. The bishop obstinately maintain- 
ed that he had been guilty of sacrilege ; 
and published a treatise in which he af- 
firmed, that in these images there re- 
sided an inherent sanctity, and that the 
adoration of Christians ought not to be 
confined to the persons represented by 
these images, but extend to the images 
themselves. The emperor assembled a 
council at Constantinople, which deter- 
mined that the images of Christ and of 
the saints were to be honoured only with 
a relative worship ; and that the invoca- 
tion and worship were to be addressed 
to the saints onlv, as the seivants oi 
Christ, and on account of their relation 
to him as their master. Leo, dissatisfied 
with these absurd and superstitious de- 
cisions, was sent into banishment. _ In the 
western church, the worship of images 
was disapproved, and opposed by seve- 
ral considerable parties, as the Petro- 
brussians, Albigenses, Waldenses, &amp;r.

ICONOLATRjE, or Iconolaters, 
those ^^'ho worship images ; a name 
which tlie Iconoclastes give to those of 
the Romish commxmion, on ac ount of

IDLENESS, a reluctancy to be em- 
ployed in any kind of work. The idle 
man is in e^^el■y -v'iew both foolish and 
criminal. "He neither lives to God, to 
the world, nor to himself. He does not 
live to God, for he answers not the end 
for which he was brought into being. 
Existence is a sacred trust ; but he who 
misemploys and squanders it away, thus 
becomes treacherous to its Autlior. 
Those powers which sh:*!ild be employ- 
ed in his service, and for the pi'omotion 
of his glory, lie dormant. The time 
which should be sacred to Jehovah is 
lost ; and thus he enjoys no fellowship 
with God_, nor any way devotes himself 
to his praise. He lives not to the world, 
nor for the beneiit of his fellow-crea- 
tures around liim. While all creation is 
full of life and activity, and nothing 
stands still in the universe, he remains 
idle, forgetting that mankind are con- 
nected by various relations and mutual 
dependencies, and that the order of the 
world cannot be maintained without 
per]}etual circulation of active duties. 
He lives not to himself. Though he ima- 
gines that he leaves to others the di-ud- 
^ery of life, and betakes himself to en- 
joyment and ease, yet, in fact, he has no 
true pleasure. While he is a blank in 
society, he is no less a torment to him- 
self; for he who knows not what it is to 
labovir, knows not what it is to enjoy. 
He shuts the door against improvement 
of every kind, whether of mind, body, or 
foi-tune. Sloth enfeebles equally the 
bodily and the mental powers. His 
character falls into contempt. Disorder, 
confusion, and embaiTassment mark his 
whole situation. Idleness is the inlet to 
a variety of other \ices. It undermines 
every virtue in the soul. Violent pas- 
sions, like rapid torrents, run their 
course; but after having overflowed 
their J anks, their im]ietuositv subsides : 
but sloth, especially when it "is habitual, 
is like the slowly-flowing putrid stream, 
which stagnates in the marsh, breeds 
venomous animals and poisonous plants, 
and infecfs with pestilential vapours the 
whole country round it. Having once 
tainted the soul, it leaves no part of it 



sound ; and at the same time gives not 
those alarms to conscience which the 
emptions'of bolder and fiercer emotions 
often occasion." Loc^an^s Sermons, vol.

IDOLATRY, the worship of idols, 
or the act of ascribing to things and per- 
sons, properties which are peculiar to 
CJod alone. The principal sources of 
idolatry seem to be the extravagant ve- 
neration for creatures and beings from 
whicli benefits accrue to men. Dr. Jor- 
tin says, tliat idolatry had four privile- 
ges to boast of. The first was a vene- 
rable antiquity, more ancient than the 
Jewish religion ; and idolaters might 
have said to the Israelites, Where was 
your i-eligion before Moses and Abi-a- 
ham ? Go, and enquire in Chaldea, and 
there you will find that your father-s 
served other gods. — 2. It was wider 
spread than the Jewish religion, l^ was 
the religion of the greatest, the wisest, 
and the politest nations of the Chal- 
deans, Egvptians, and Phcenicians, the 
parents of civil government, and of arts 
and sciences. — 3. It was more adapted 
to tlie bent which men have towards 
visible and sensible objects. Men want 
gods who shall go before them, and be 
among them. God, who is every where 
in power, and no where in appearance, 
is hard to be conceived. — 4. It favoured 
human passions: it required no morality: 
its religious ritual con.sisted of splendid 
ceremonies, revelling, dancing, noctur- 
nal assemblies, impure and scandalous 
mysteries, debauched priests, and gods, 
who were both slaves and patrons to all 
sorts of vices. 

"All the more remarkable false reli- 
gions that have been or are in the world, 
recommend themselves by one or other 
of these four pri\ ileges and characters." 

The first oiijects ot idolatrous wor- 
ship ai-e thought to have been the sun. 
moon, and stars. Others think that an- 
gels were first worshipped. Soon after 
the flood we find idolatry greatly pre- 
vailing in the world. Abraham's father's 
familv served other gods beyond the 
rivei' Euphrates ; and Laban had idols 
which Rachel brought along with her. 
In process of time, noted patriots, or 
kings deceased, animals of various kinds, 
])lants, stones, and, in fine, whatever 
people took a fancy to, they idolized. 
The Egyptians, though high pretenders 
to wisdom, worshipped pied bulls, snipes, 
leeks, onions, &amp;c. The Greeks had 
about 30,000 gods. The Gomerians de- 
ified their ancient kings; nor were the

Chaldeans, Romans, Chinese, &amp;c. a whit 
less absurd. Some violated the most na- 
tural affections by murdering muhitudes 
of their neighbours and children, under 
pretence of sacrificing them to their god. 
Some nations of Germany, Scandinavia, 
and Tartary, imagined that violent ' 
death in war, or by self-murder, was the i 
proper method of access to the future 
enjoyment of their gods. In far later 
times, about 64,080 persons were sacri- 
ficed at the dedication of one idolatrous 
temple in the space of four days in 
America. The Hebrews never had any 
idols of their own, but they adopted 
those of the nations around. The vene- 
ration which the Papists pay to the Vir- 
gin Mary, and other saints and angels, 
and to the bread in the sacrament, the 
cross, relics, and images, lays a founda- 
tion for the Protestants to charge them 
with idolatry, though they deny the 
charge. It is evident that they worship 
them, and that they justify the worship, 
but deny the idolatry of it, by distin- 
guishing subordinate from sufireme wor- 
ship : the one they call latrio, the other 
dulia: but this distinction is thought by 
many of the Protestants to be vain, fu- 
tile, and nugatory. 

Idolatry has been divided into meta- 
phorical and firofier. By metaphorical 
idolatry, is meant that inordinate love 
of riches, honours, and bodily pleasures, 
whereby the passions and appetites of 
men are made superior to the will of 
God; man, by so doing, making a god of 
himself and his sensual temper. Pro- 
per idolatry" is giving the divine honour 
to another. The objects or idols of that 
honour which are given are either per- 
sonal, i. e. the idolatrous themselves, 
who become their own statues ; or in- 
ternal^ as false ideas, which are set up 
in the fancy instead of God, such as fan- 
cying God to be a light, flame, matter, 
&amp;c. only here, the scene being internal, 
the scandal of the sin is thereby abated ; 
or external, as worshipping angels, the 
sun, stars, animals, &amp;c. Tenison on Ido-

JEALOUSY is that particular unea- 
siness which arises from the fear that 
some rival may rob us of the affection of 
one whom we greatly love, or suspicion 
that he has already done it. The first 
sort of jealousy is inseparable from love, 
before it is in possession of its object ; 
the latter is unjust, generally mischiev- 
eus, and always troublesome. 



JEHOVAH, one of the Scripture 
names of God, and peculiar to him, sig- 
nifying the Being who is self-existent, 
and gives existence to others. The 
name is also given to Christ, Is. xl. 3. 
and is a proof of his godhead, Matt. iii. 
3. Is. vi. John xii. 41. The Jews had so 
great a veneration for this name, that 
thev left off the custom of pronouncing 
it, whereby its true pronunciation was 
forgotten. They believe that whosoever 
knows the true pronunciation of it can- 
not fail to be heard of God. 

JESUITS, or the Society of Jesus; a 
famous religious order of the Romish 
Church, founded by Ignatius Loyola, a 
Spanish knight, in the sixteenth centu- 
ry. The plan which this fanatic formed 
of its constitution and laws,_ was sug- 
gested, as he gave out, by the immediate 
inspiration of Heaven. But, notwith- 
standing this high pretension, his design 
met at first with violent opposition. The 
pope, to whom I^oyola had applied for 
the sanction of his authority to confirm 
the institution, referred his petition to a 
committee of cardinals. They represen- 
ted the establishment to be unnecessaiy 
as well as dangerous, and Paul refused 
to grant his approbation of it. At last, 
Loyola removed all his scruples, by an 
offer which it was impossible for any 
pope to resist. He projjosed, that be- 
sides the three vows of poverty, of chas- 
tity, and of monastic obedience, whicli 
are common to all the orders of regu- 
lars, the members of his society should 
take a fourth vow of obedience to the 
pope, binding themselves to go whithei'^ 
soever he should command for the ser- 
vice of religion, and without I'cquiring 
any thing from the holy see for their 
support. At a time when the papal 
authority had received such a shock by 
the revolt of so many nations from the 
Romish church, at a' time when every 
part of the popish system was attacked 
with so much violence and success, the 
acquisition of a body of men, thus pecu- 
liarly devoted to the see of Rome, and 
whom it might set in opposition to all 
its enemies, was an object of the highest 
consequence. Paul, instantly perceiving 
this, confirmed the institution of the Je- 
suits by his bull ; granted the most am- 
ple privileges to the members of the 
society, and appointed Loyola to be the 
first general oi the order. The event 
fully justified Paul's discernment in ex- 
pecting such beneficial consequences to 
the see of Rome from this institution.. In 
less than half a century the society ob- 
tained establishments in every country 
that adhered to the Roman Catholic 
church J its power and wealth increased

amazingly ; the number of its members 
became i^reat ; their character as well 
as accomplishments were still greater ; 
and the Jesuits were celebrated by the 
friends and dreaded by the enemies of 
the Romish faith, as the most able and 
enterprising order in the church. 

2. Jesuits, object of the order of. — 
The primary object of almost all the 
monastic orders is to separate men from 
the world, and from any concern in its 
affairs. In the solitude and silence of 
the cloister, the monk is called to work 
out his salvation by extraordinary acts 
of mortification and piety. He is dead 
to the world, and ought not to mingle in 
its transactions. He can be of no benefit 
to mankind but by his example and by 
his prayers. On the contrary, the Je- 
suits are taught to consider themselves 
as fonned for action. They are chosen 
soldiei-s, bound to exert themselves con- 
tinually in the service of God, and of the 
pope, his vicar on earth. Whatever 
tends to instruct the ignorant, whatever 
can be of use to reclaim or oppose the 
enemies of the lioly see, is their proper 
object. That they may have full leisure 
for this active service, they are totally 
exempted fi*om those functions, the per- 
formance of which is the chief business 
of other monks. They appear in no 
processions ; they practise -no rigorous 
austerities ; they do not consimie one 
half of their time in the repetition of te- 
dious offices ; but they are required to 
a.ttend to all the transactions of the 
world on account of the influence which 
these may have upon religion : they are 
directed to study the dispositions of per- 
sons in high rank, and to cultivate their 
friendship ; and, by the very constitu- 
tion and genius of the order, a spirit of 
action and intrigue is infused into all its 
membei-s. 

3. Jesuits, peculiarities of their policy 
and goveiviment. — Other orders are to 
be considered as voluntary associations, 
in which, whatever affects the whole 
body, is regulated by the common suf- 
frage of all its membei-s. But Loyola, 
full of the ideas of implicit obedience, 
which he had derived from his military 
profession, appointed that the govern- 
ment of his order should be purely mo- 
narchical. _ A general chosen for life, by 
deputies from the several provinces, 
possessed power that was supreme and 
independent, extending to every person | 
and to evei-y case. To his commands I 
they were rec^uired to yield not only I 
outward obedience, but to resign up to I 
him the inclinations of their own wills, I 
and the sentiments of their own under- 
■standings. Such a sihgular form of po- { 



licy could not fail to impress its charac- 
ter on all its members of the order, and 
to give a peculiar force to all its opera- 
tions. There has not been, perhaps, in 
the annals of mankind, any example of 
such a perfect despotism exercised, not 
ovei- monks shut up in the cells of a con- 
vent, but over men dispersed among all 
the nations of the earth. As the consti- 
tutions of the order vest in the general 
such absolute dominion over all its mem- 
bers, they carefully provide for his be- 
ing perfectly informed with respect to 
the character and abilities of his sub- 
• jects. Every novice who ofl^ers himself 
as a candidate for entering into the or- 
der, is obliged to manifest his conscience 
to the superior, or a person appointed 
by him ; and is required to confess not 
only his sins and defects, but to discover 
the inclinations, the passions, and the 
bent of the soul. This manifestation 
must be renewed every six months. 
Each member is directed to observe the 
words and actions of the novices, and 
are bound to disclose every thing of im- 
portance concerning them to the supe- 
rior. In order that this scrutiny into 
their character may be as complete as 
possible, a long novitiate must expire, 
during which they pass through the se- 
veral gradations of rank in the society ; . 
and they must have attained the full 
age of thirty-three years before they 
can be admitted to take the final vows 
by which they become professed mem- 
bers. By these various methods, the su- 
periors under whose immediate inspec- 
tion the novices are placed, acquire a 
thorougli knowledge of their disposi- 
tions and talents ; and the general, by 
examining the registers kept for this 
purpose, is enabled to choose the instru- 
ments which his absolute power can 
employ in any service for which he 
thinks meet to destine them. 

4. Jesuits, progress of the power and 
injlue?ice of. — As it was the professed 
intention of this order to labour with 
unwearied zeal in promoting the salva- 
tion of men, this engaged them, of 
course, in many active functions. From 
their first institution, they considered 
the education of youth as their peculiar 
province: they aimed at being spiritual 
guides and confessors ; they preached 
frequently in order to instruct the peo- 
ple ; they set out as missionaries to con- 
vert unbelieving nations. Before the ex- 
piration of the sixteenth century, they 
had obtained the chief direction of tlie 
education of youth in every Catholic 
country in Europe. They had become 
the confessors of almost all its mo- 
nurchs ; a function of no small impor-

tance in any reign, but, under a -weak 
prince, superior to tliat of minister. 
They were the spiritual guides of al- 
most every person eminent for rank or 
power ; thev possessed the highest de- 
gree of confidence and interest with the 
papal court, as the most zealous and 
able champions for .its authority ; they 
possessed, at different periods, the di- 
rection of the most considerable courts 
in Europe ; they mingled in all affairs, 
and took part in every intrigue and re- 
volution. But while they thus advan- 
ced in power, they increased also in 
wealth ; various expedients were devi- 
sed for eluding tlie obligation of the vow 
of poverty. Besides the sources of 
wealth common to all the regular cler- 
gy, the Jesuits possessed one which was 
peculiar to themselves. — Under the 
pretext of promoting the success of 
their missions, and of facilitating the 
support of their missionaries, they ob- 
tanicd a special license from the court 
of Rome, to trade with the nations which 
they laboured to convert : in conse- 
quence of this, they engaged in an ex- 
tensive and lucrative commerce, both 
in the East and West Indies ; they 
opened warehouses in different parts of 
Europe, in which they vended their 
commodities. Not satisfied with trade 
alone, they imitated the example of 
other commercial societies, and aimed 
at obtaining settlements. They acqui- 
red possession, accordingly, of the large 
and fertile province of Paraguay, which 
stretches aci'oss the southern continent 
of America, from the bottom of the 
mountains of Potosi to the confines of 
the Spanish and Portuguese settlements 
on the banks of the river De la Plata. 
Here, indeed, it must be confessed, they 
Avere of service : they found the inhabi- 
tants in a state little different from that 
which takes place among men when 
they first begin to unite together ; stran- 
gers to the arts; subsisting precariously 
by hunting or fishing; anci hardly ac- 
quainted with the first principles oi sub- 
ordination and government. — The Je- 
suits set themselves to insti-uct and ci- 
vilize these savages : they taught them 
to cultivate the ground, build houses, 
and brought them to live together in 
villages, 8cc. They made them taste the 
•sweets of society, and trained them to 
arts and manufactures. Such was their 
power over them, that a few Jesuits 
presided over some hundred thousand 
Indians. But even in this meritorious 
effort of the Jesuits for the good of 
mankind, the genius and spirit of their 
order was discernible : they jjlainly 
aimed at establishing in Paraguay an 



independent en«pire, subject to the so- 
ciety alone, and which, ])y the superior 
excellence of its constitution and police, 
coidd scarcely have failed to extend its 
dominion over all the southern continent 
of America. With this view, in order 
to prevent the Spaniards or Portuguese 
in the adjacent settlements from acqui- 
ring any dangerous influence over the 
people within the limits of the ])rovince 
subject to the society, the Jesuits en- 
deavoured to inspire the Indians with 
hatred and contempt of these nations : 
they cut off all intercourse between 
then* subjects and the Spanish or Portu- 
guese settlements. When they were 
obliged to admit any person in a public 
character from the neighbouring go- 
vernments, they did not permit hmi to 
have any conversation with their sub- 
jects ; and no Indian was allowed even 
to enter the house where these strangers 
resided, unless in the presence of a Jesuit. 
In order to render any communication 
between them as difficult as possible, 
they industriously avoided giving the 
Indians any knowledge of the Spanish 
or of any other European language ; but 
encouraged the different tribes which 
tliey had civilized to acquire a certain 
dialect of the Indian tongue, and labour- 
ed to make that the universal language 
throughout their dominions. As all 
these precautions, without military 
force, would have been insufficient to 
have rendered their empire secure and 
permanent, tliey instructed their sub- 
jects in the European art of war, and 
formed them into bodies completely 
amned, and well disciplined. 

5. Jesuits, pernicious effects of this 
order in civil society. — Though it must 
be confessed that the Jesuits cultivated 
the stud)^ of ancient literature, and con- 
tributed much towards the progress of 
polite learning ; thotigh they have pro- 
duced eminent masters in every branch 
of science, and can boast of a number of 
ingenious authors; yet, unhappily for 
mankind, their vast mfluence has been 
often exerted with the most fatal effects. 
Such was the. tendency of that discipline 
observed by the society in forming its 
members, and such the fundamental 
maxims in its constitution, that every 
Jesuit was taught to regard the inte- 
rest of the order as the capital oliject to 
which every consideration was to be 
sacrificed. As the prosperity of the 
order was intimately connected with 
the preservation of the papal authority, 
the Jesuits, influenced by the same prin- 
ciple of attachment to tlie interest of 
their society, have been the most zeal- 
ous patrons of those doctrines whiQh

tend to exalt ecclesiastical power on 
■the I'uins of civil government. They 
have attributed to the couit of Rome a 
jurisdiction as extensive and absolute as 
was claimed by the most presumptuous 
pontiffs in the dark ages. They have 
contended for the entire independence 
of ecclesiastics on the civil magistrates. 
They have published such tenets con- 
cerning the duty of opposing princes 
who were enemies of the Catholic faith, 
as countenanced the most atrocious 
crimes, and tended to dissolve all the 
ties which connect subjects with their 
rulers. As the order deri\cd both re- 
putation and authority from the zeal 
with which it stood forth in defence of 
the Romish church against the attacks 
of the reformei's, its members, proud of 
this distinction, have considered it as 
their peculiar function to combat the 
opinions, and to chsfck tlie progress of 
the Protestants. They have made use 
of every art, and ha\ e employed every 
weapon against them. They have set 
themselves in opposition to every gen- 
tle or tolerating measure in their fa- 
vour. They have incessantly stirred up 
against them all tlie rage of ecclesiasti- 
cal and civil persecution. Whoever 
recollects the events which have hap- 
})ened in Europe during two centuries, 
will find that the Jesuits may justly be 
considered as responsible for most of 
tlie pernicious' effects arising from that 
corrupt and dangerous casuistry, from 
those extravagant tenets concerning ec- 
clesiastical power, and from tliat intole- 
rant spirit which have been the disgrace 
of the church of Rome througliout that 
period, and which have brought so 
many calamities upon society. 

6. Jcsidfs, dot'Jiifall in F.urope. — 
Such were the laws, the policy, and the 
genius of this formidable order ; of 
which, however, a perfect knowledge 
has only Ijeen attainable of late.. Eu- 
rope had obser\ ed, for two centuries, 
the ambition and power of the order; 
but while it felt many fatal effects of 
these, it could not fully discern the cau- 
ses to which they were to be imputed. 
It was unacquainted with many of the 
singular regulations in the political con- 
.stitution or government of tlie Jesuits, 
whicli formed the enterprising spirit of 
intrigiie that distinguished 'ts members, 
and elevated the body itself to such a 
height of power. It was a fundamental 
maxim with the Jesuits, from their 
first institution, not to pulilish the niles 
of their order: these they kept conceal- 
ed as an impenetrable mystery. They 
never communicated them to strangers, 
nor ex-en to the greater part of their 



own members : they refused to produce 
them when required by courts of jus- 
tice ; and by a strange solecism in poli- 
cy, the civil power in different countries 
authorized or connived at tlie establish- 
ment of an order of men, whose con^i- 
tution and laws were concealed with a 
solicitude which ajone was a good rea- 
son for having excluded them. During 
the prosecutions which liave been car- 
ried on against them in Portugal and 
France, the Jesuits have been so incon- 
siderate as to produce the mysterious 
volumes of their institute. By the aid 
of these authentic records, the princi- 
ples of their government may be deli- 
neated, and the sources of their power 
investigated, with a degree of certainty 
and precision which, previous to that 
e\ent, it was impossible to attain. 

The pernicious effects of the spirit 
and constitiition of this order rendered 
it early obnoxious to some of the prin- 
cipal powers in Europe, and gradually 
brought on its downfall. There is a re- 
markal)le passage in a sermon preach- 
ed at Dublin by Archbishop Brown, so 
long ago as the year 1551, and which 
may be considered almost as prophetic. 
It is as follows: "But there are a new 
" fraternity of late sprung up who call 
"themselves Jesuits, which will deceive 
" many, much after the Scribes and 
" Pharisees' manner. Amongst the 
"Jews they shall strive to abolish the 
" truth, and shall come Aery near to do 
" it. For these sorts will turn them- 
" selves into several forms; with the 
" heathen, a heathcnist ; with the atheist, 
"an atheist; with the Jews, a Jew; 
" with the reffirmers, a reformade, pur- 
" posely to know your intentions, your 
" minds, your hearts, and your inclina- 
" tions, and thereby bring you, at last, to 
"be like the fool that said in his heai't, 
"there was no God. These shall be 
" spread over the whole world, shall be 
" admitted into the councils of princes;, 
"and they never the .wiser; charming 
"of theni, yea, making your princes 
"reveal their hearts, and the secrets 
" therein, and yet thev not perceive it ; 
"which will happen from falling from 
"the law of Ciod, by neglect of fnlfil- 
" ling the law of God, and by winking 
" at their sins ; yet, in the end, God, to 
" justify his law, shall suddenly cut off 
"this society, even by the hands of 
" those who have most succoured them, 
"and made use of them ; so that at the 
"end t1\ey shall become odious to all 
"nations. They shall be worse than 
" Jews, having no resting place upon 
"earth; and then shall a Jew have 
"more favour than a Jesuit." .This

JESUS CHRIST, the Lord and Sa- 
viour of mankind. He is called Christ 
(anointed,) because he is anointed, fur- 
nished, and sent by God to execute his 
mediatorial office ; and Jesus (Saviour,) 
because he came to save his people from 
their sins. For an account of his nativi- 
ty, offices, death, resurrection, gee. the 
reader is referred to those articles in 
this work. We shall here more paiti- 
cularly con.sider his divinity, humanity, 
and character. The divinity of Jesus 
Christ seems evident, if we consider, 1. 
The language cf the A'eiv Testament, 
and conijuire it with the state of the Pa- 

fan world at the time of its fiublication. 
f Jesus Christ were not God, the wri- 
ters of the New Testament discovei-ed 
gi'eat injudiciousness in the choice of 
their words, and adopted a very incau- 
tious and dangerous style. The whole 
world, except the small kingdom of 
Judea, worshipped idols at the time of 
Jesus Christ's appearance. Jesus Christ; 
the evangelists, who wrote his history ; 
and the apostles, who wrote epistles to 
various classes of men, proposed to de- 
stroy idolatry, and to establish the wor- 
ship of one only living and true God. To 
eflect this purpose, it was absolutely 
necessary for these founders of Christi- 
anity to avoid confusion and obscurity 
of langiiage, and to express their ideas 
in a cool and cautious style. The least 
expression that would tend to deify a 
creature, or countenance idolatry, would 
have been a source of the greatest error. 
Hence Paul and Bainiabas rent their 
clothes at the very idea of the multi- 
tude's confounding the creature with 
the Creator, Acts xiv. Tl-.e writers of 
the New Testament knew that in 
speaking of Jesus Christ, extraordinary 
caution was necessary ; yet, when Ave 
take up the New Testament, we find 
such expressions as these : " The word 
was God, John i. 1. God was manifest 
in the Hesh, 1 Tim. iii. 16. God with 
us, Matt. i. 23. The Jews crucified the 
Lord of gloiy, 1 Cor ii. 8. Jesus Christ 
is Lord of all. Acts x. 36. Christ is 
over all ; God blessed for ever, Rom. ix. 
^•" These are a few of many proposi- 



tions, which the New Testament writei'S 
lay down relative to Jesus Christ. If 
the writei-s intended to affii-m the divi- 
nity of Jesus Christ, these are words of 
truth and soberness ; if not, the language 
is incautious and unwarrantable ; and t» 
address it to men prone to idolatry, for 
the purpose of destroying idolatry, is a 
strong presumption against their inspi- 
I'ation. It is remarkalile, also, that the 
richest words in the (ireek language are 
made use of to descrilje Jesus Christ. 
This language, which is veiy copious, 
would ha\e afforded lower terms to ex- 
press an inferior nature ; but it could 
have afforded none higher to express 
the nature of the Supreme God. It is 
worthy of observation, too, that these 
writers addressed their writings not to 
philosophers and scholars, but to the 
common people, and consequently used 
words in their plain popular signification. 
The common people, it seems, under- 
stood the words in our sense of them ; 
for in the Dioclesian persecution, when 
the Roman soldiers bunit a Phrygian 
city inhabited by Christians; men, wo- 
men, and children suljmitted to tlieir 
i-Ate, calling ti/ion Christ, thk god ovkr 
ALL. — 2. Comfiare the style of the J^ew 
Testament with the state of the Jews at 
the time of its fiublication. In the time 
of Jesus Christ, the Jews were zealous 
defenders of the unity of (iod, and of 
that idea of his perfections which the 
Scriptures excited. Jesus Christ and 
his apostles professed the highest regard 
for the Jewisli Sci-iptures ; yet the wri- 
ters of the New Testament described 
Jesus Christ by the veiy names and 
titles by which the writers of the Old 
Testament had described the Supreme 
God. Compare Exod. iii. 14. with Jo]n\ 
viii. 58. Is. xliv. 6. with Rev. i.' 11, 
17. Dent. x. 17. with Rev. xrvii, 14. 
Ps. xxiv. 10. with 1 Cor. ii. 8. Hos. i. 7. 
with Luke ii. 11. Dan. v. 23. with 1 Cor. 
XV. 47. 1 Chron. xxix. 11. with Col. ii. 
10. If they who described Jesus Christ 
to the Jews by these sacred names and 
titles intended to convey an idea of his 
deity, the description is just and the 
application safe ; but if they intended to 
desci'ibe a mere man, they were sui-ely 
of all men the most preposterous. Tliey 
chose a method of recommending Jesus 
to the Jews the most likely to alai-m and 
enrage them. Whatever they meant, 
the Jews understood them in our sense, 
and took Jesus for a blasphemer, John., 
x. 33. — 3. Comfiare the jierfcctians which 
are ascribed to Jesus Christ in the Scri/i- 
tures, with those which are ascribed 
to God. Jesus Christ declares, "All 
things that the Father hath are mine,"

John xvi. 15. a very dangerous proposi- 
tion, if he were not God. The writers 
of revelation ascribe to him the same 
perfections which they ascribe to God. 
Compare Jer. x. 10. with Isa. ix. 6. 
Exod. XV. 13. with Heb. i. 8. Jer. xxxii. 

19. with Is. ix. 6. Ps. cii. 24, 27. with 
Heb. xiii. 8. Jei'. xxiii. 24. with Eph..i. 

20, 23. 1 Sam. ii. 5. with John xiy. 30. 
If Jesus Cliinst be God, the ascription of 
the pei'fections of God to him is proper ; 
if he be not, the apostles are chargeable 
with weakness or wickedness, and either 
would destroy their claim of inspiration. 
— 4. Consider the works (hat are as- 
cribed to Jesus Christ, and compare 
them with the claims of Jehovah. Is 
creation a work of God ? " By Jesus 
Christ were all things created," Col. i. 
16. Is preservation a work of God."* 
"Jesus Christ upholds all things by the 
word of his power," Heb. i. 3. Is the 
mission of the prophets a work of God .'' 
Jesus Christ is the Lord God of the holy 
prophets ; and it was the Spirit of Christ 
■which testified to them beforehand the 
sufferings of Christ, and the glory that 
should follow, Neh. ix. 30. Rev. x'xii. 6, 
16. 1 Pet. i. 11. Is the salvation of sin- 
ners a work of God .&gt; Christ is the Sa- 
viour of all that believe, John iv. 42. 
Heb. v. 9. Is the forgiveness of sin a 
•work of God * The Son of Man hath 
power to forgive sins. Matt. ix. 6. The 
same might be said of the illumination 
of the mind ; the sanctification of the 
heart; the resurrection of the dead: 
the judging of the world; the glorifi- 
cation of the righteous; the eternal 
punishment of the wicked; all which 
works, in one part of Scripture, are as- 
cribed to God ; and all which, in ano- 
ther part of Scripture, are ascribed to 
Jesus Christ. Now, if Jesus Christ be 
not God, into what contradictions these 
writers must fall ! They contradict- one 
another: they contradict themselves. 
Either Jesus Christ is God, or their con- 
duct is unaccountable. — 5. Consider that 
divine worshiji which the Scriptures 
claim for Jesus Christ. It is a command 
of God, " Thou shalt worship the Lord 
thy God, and him only.shalt thou serve," 
Matt. iv. 20. \et the Scriptures com- 
mand " all the angels of God to worship 
Christ," Heb. i. 6. Twenty times, m the 
New Testament, grace, mercy, and 
peace, are implored of Christ, together 
■with the Father. Baptism is an act of 
worship performed in his name, Matt, 
xxviii. 19. Swearing is an act of woi-- 
ship ; a solemn appeal in impoitant 
cases to the omniscient God ; and this 
appeal is made to Christ, Rom. ix. 1 
'1 he committing of the soul to God at 



death is a sacred act of worship : in the 
perform ance of this act, Stephen died, 
saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. 
Acts vii. 59. The whole host oi heaven 
worship him that sitteth upon the 
thi'one, and the Lamb, for ever and 
ever. Rev. v. 14, 15. — 6. Observe the 
application of Old Testameyit passages 
which belong to Jehovah, to Jesus in the 
jVew Testament, and try whether you 
can acquit the writers of the A''ew Tes- 
tament of misrepresentation, on suppo- 
sition that Jesus is not- God. St. Paul 
says, "We shall all stand before the 
judgment-seat of Christ." That we 
shall all be judged, we allow ; but how 
do you prove that Christ shall be our 
Judge ? Because, adds the apostle, it is 
written, "As I live, saith the Lord,, 
every knee shall bow to me, and every 
tongue shall confess to God," Rom. xiv. 
10, 11, with Is. xlv. 20, 8cc. What sort 
of veas-oning is this ? How does this ap- 
ply to Christ, if Christ be not God? 
And how dare a man quote one of the 
most guarded passages in the Old Tes- 
tament for such a purpose ? John the 
Baptist is he who was spoken of by the 
prophet Esaias, saying, Prepare ye the 
way, Matt. iii. 1, 3. Isaiah saith. Pre- 
pare ye the Avay of the Lord ; make 
straight a highway for our God, Is. xl. 
3, &amp;c. But what has John the Baptist 
to do with all this description if Jesus 
Chi'ist be only a messenger of Jehovah, 
and not Jehovah himself? for Isaiah 
saith, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah. 
Compare also Zech. xii. 10. with John 
xix. 34, 37. Is. vi. with John xii. 39. Is. 
viii. 13, 14. with 1 Pet. ii. 8. Allow Je- 
sus Christ to be God, and jill these ap- 
plications are proper. If we deny it, 
the New Testament, we must own is 
one of the most unaccountable compo- 
sitions in the world, calculated to make 
easy things hard to be understood. — 7. 
Examine whether events have justified 
that notion of Christianity which the 
prophets gave their countrymen of it, 
if Jesus Christ be not God. The calling 
of the Gentiles from the worship of idols 
to the worship of the one living and true 
God, is one event, which, the prophets 
said, the coming of the Messiah should 
bring to pass. If Jesus Christ be GM, 
the event answers the prophecy; if not, 
the event is not come to pass, for Chris- 
tians in general worship Jesus, which is 
idolatry, if he be not God, Isaiah ii. iii. 
and iv.'Zeph. ii. 11. Zech. xiv. 9. The 
primitive Christians certainly woi'ship- 
ped Him as God. Pliny, who was ap- 
pointed governor of the province of Bi- 
thynia bv the emperor Trajjm, in the 
year 103,examiTled and punished several

Christians for their non-conformity to the 
established rehgion of the empire. In a 
letter to the emperor, giving an account 
of his conduct, he declares, "they af- 
firmed the whole of their guilt, or their 
error, was, that they met on a certain 
stated day, before it was light, and ad- 
dressed themselves in a form of prayer 
to Christ as to some God." Tims Pliny 
meant to inform the emperor that 
Christians nvorshipfied Christ. Justin 
Martyr, who lived about 150 years after 
Christ, asserts, that the Christians wor- 
shipped the Father, the Son, and the 
Spirit. Besides his testimony, there are 
numberless passages in the fathers that 
attest the truth in question ; especially 
in Tertullian, Hippolytus, Felix, &amp;c. 
Mahomet, who lived iii the sixth cen- 
tury, considers Christians in the light of 
infidels and idolaters throughout the 
Koran ; and indeed, had not Christians 
worshipped Christ, he could have had 
no shadow of a pretence tQ reform their 
religion, and to bring them back to the 
worship of one God. That the far 
greater part of Christians have con- 
tinued to worship Jesus, will not be 
doubted ; now, it Christ be not God, 
then the Christians have been guilty of 
idolatry ; and if they have been guilty of 
idolatry, then it must appear remarka- 
ble that the apostles, who foretold the 
corruptions of Christianity, 2 Tim. iii. 
should never have foreseen nor warned 
us against worshipping Christ. In no part 
of the Scripture is there the least inti- 
mation of Christians falling into idolatry 
in this respect. Surely if this had been 
an error which was so universally to 
prevail, those Scriptures which are able 
to make us wise unto sahation, would 
have left us warning on so important a 
topic. Lastly, consider what numberless 
passaf(es of Scripture have no sense, or 
a very absurd one, if Jesus Christ be a 
Tnere man. See Rom. i. 3. 1 Tim. iii. 16. 
John xiv. 9. xvii. 5. Phil. ii. 6. Ps. ex. 1, 4. 
1 Tim. i. 2. Acts xxii. 12. and ix. 17. 

But though Jesus Christ be God, yet 
for our sakes, and for our salvation, he 
took upon him' human nature ; this is 
therefore called his humanity. Mar- 
cion, Apelles, Valentinus, and many 
other heretics, denied Christ's huma- 
nity, as some have done since. But 
that Christ had a true human body, and 
not a mere human shape, or a body that 
was not real flesh, is very evident from 
the sacred Scriptures, Is. vii. 12. Luke 
xxiv. 39. Heb. ii. 14. Luke i. 42. Phil, 
ii. 7, 8. John i. 14. Besides, he ate, 
drank, slept, walked, worked, and was 
weary. He groaned, bled, and died, upon 
the cross. It was necessar\ tha*- he 



should thus be human, in oi-der to fulfil 
the divine designs and prophecies re- 
specting the shedding of his blood for 
our salvation, which could not have been 
done had he not possessed a real body. 
It is also as evident that he assumed our 
whole nature, soul as well as body. If 
he had not, he could not have been ca- 
pable of that sore amazement and sor- 
row unto death, and all those other acts 
of grieving, feeling, rejoicing, &amp;c. as- 
scribed to him. It was not, however, our 
sinful nature he assumed, but the liker 
ness of it, Rom. viii. 2. for he was with- 
out sin, and did no iniquity. His human 
nature must not be confovmded with his 
divine ; for though there be an union of 
natures in Christ, yet there is not a mix- 
ture or confusion of them or their pro- 
perties. His humanity is not changed 
into his deity, nor his deity into huma- 
nity ; but the two natures are distinct 
in one person. How this union exists is 
above our comprehension ; and, indeed, 
if we cannot explain how our own bodies 
and souls are united, it is not to be sup- 
posed Ave can explain this astonishing 
mystery of God manifest in the flesh. 
See Mediator. 

\^'e how proceed to the character of 
Jesus Christ, which, while it affords us 
the most pleasing subject for meditation, 
exhibits to us an example of the most 
perfect and delightful kind. 

" Here," as an elegant writer ob- 
serves " every grace that can recom- 
mend religion, and every virtue that can 
adorn humanity, are so blended, as to 
excite our admiration, and engage our 
love. In abstaining from licentious plea- 
sures, he was equally free from ostenta- 
tious singularity and churlish sullen- 
ness. When he complied with the es- 
tablished ceremonies of his countrymen, 
that compliance was not accompanied 
by any marks of bigotry or superstition : 
when he opposed their rooted prepos- 
sessions, his opposition was perfectly ex- 
empt from the captious petulance of a 
controversialist, and the undistinguish- 
ing zeal of an innovator. His courage 
was active in encountering the dangers 
to which he was exposed, and passive 
under the aggravated calamities which 
the malice of his foes heaped upon him : 
his fortitude was remote from e^^ery ap- 
pearance of rashness, and his patience 
was equally exempt from abject pusil- 
lanimity: lie was firm without obstinacy, 
and humble without meanness.— Thougli 
possessed of the most unbounded power, 
we behold hini living continually in a 
state of voluntary humiliation and po- 
verty; we see him daily exposed to al- 
most everv species of want and dis-

tress; afflicted without a comforter, 
persecuted Avithout a protector ; and 
wandering about, according to his own 
pathetic complaint, because he had not 
•where to laij his head. Though regard- 
less of the pleasures, and sometimes 
destitute of the comforts of life, he never 
pro\'okes our disgust by the sourness of 
the misanthrope, or our contempt by the 
inactivity of the recluse. His attention 
to the Velfare of mankind was evidenc- 
ed not only by his salutary injunctions, 
•but by his readiness to embrace every 
opportunity of relieving their distress 
and administering to their wants. In 
every period and ciixumstance of his 
life, we behold dignity and elevation 
blended with love and pity ; something, 
which, though it awakens our admira- 
tion, yet attracts our confidence. We 
see power; but it is power which is 
i-ather our security than our dread; a 
power softened with tenderness, and 
soothing wh.ile it awes. With all the 
gentleness of a meek and lowly mind, 
we behold an hei'oic firmness, which no 
terrors could restrain. In the private 
scenes of life, and m the public occupa- 
tions of his ministry ; whether the object 
of admiration or ridicule, of love or of 
persecution ; whether welcomed with 
hosannas, or insulted with anathemas, 
we still see him pursuing with unweari- 
ed constancy the same end, and pre- 
serving the same integrity of life and 
manners." White's Sej-inons, ser. 5. 

Coufiiderhig him as a Moral Teacher, 
we must be struck with the greatest ad- 
miration. As Dr. Paley observes, " he 
preferred solid to popular virtues, a 
character Avhich is commonly despised, 
to a character universally extolled, he 
placed, in our licentious vices, the check 
m the right place, viz. upon the thoughts ; 
he collected human duty into two wt-U- 
devised rules ; he repeated these rules, 
and laid great stress upon them, and 
thereby fixed the sentiments of his fol- 
lowers ; he excluded all regard to repu- 
tation in our devotion and alms, and, by 
Earity of reason, in our other virtues ; 
is instiiictions were delivered in a form 
calculated for impression ; thev were 
illustrated by parables, the choice and 
stiiicture of which Avould have been ad- 
mired in any composition whatever : he 
was fi'ee from the usual symptoms of 
enthusiasm,, heat, and vehemence in de- 
votion,- austerity in institutions, and a 
wild particularity in the description of 
a future state ; he was, free also from 
the depravities of his age and country ; 
without superstition among the most su- 
perstitious of men, yet not decrying po- 
bitive distinctions or externarobsevv-) 



ances, but soberly recalling them to the 
principle of their establishment, and to 
their place in the scale of human duties ; 
there was nothing of sophistry or triiling, 
though amidst teachers remarkable for 
nothing so much as frivolous subtilcies 
and quibbling expositions : he was candid 
and libei-al in his judgment of the rest of 
mankind, although belonging to a peo- 
ple who affected a separate claim to di- 
vine favour, and, in consequence of that 
opinion, prone to uncharitableness, par- 
tiality, and restriction; in his religion 
there was no scheme of building up a 
hierarchy, or of ministering to the views 
of human governments; in a word, there 
was every thing so grand in doctrine, 
and so delightful in manner, that the 
people might well exclaim — Surely, 
never man spake like this man !" 

yls to his exayn/.'e, bishop Newcome 
observes, " it was of the most perfect 
piety to God, and of the most extensive 
benevolence. and the most tender com- 
passion to men. He does not merely 
exhibit a life of strict justice, but of 
overflowing benignity. His temperance 
has not the dark shades of austerity ; 
his meekness does not degenerate into 
apathy ; his humility is signal, amidst 
a splendour of qualities more than 
human ; his fortitude is eminent and 
exemplary in enduring the most formi- 
dable external evils, and the sharpest 
actual sufferings. His patience is invin- 
cible; his resignation entire and abso- 
lute. Truth and sincerity shine through- 
out his whole conduct. Though of hea- 
venly descent, he shows obedience and 
affection to his earthly parents ; he ap- 
proves, loves, and attaches himself to 
amiable qualities in the human race ; he 
respects authority, religious and civil ; 
and he evidences regard for his country, 
by promoting its most essential good in 
a painful ministry dedicated to its ser- 
vice, by deploring its calamities, and 
by laying down his life for its benefit. 
Every one of his eminent virtues is regu- 
lated by consummate pmdence : and he 
both wins the love oi his friends, and 
extorts the apjjrobation and wonder of 
his enemies. Never was a character at 
the same time so commanding and" na- 
tural, so resplendent and pleasing, so 
amiable and veneraljle. There is a pe- 
culiar contrast in it between an awful 
greatness, dignity, and majesty, and the 
most conciliating loveliness, tenderness, 
and softness. . He now converses with 
prophets, lawgivers, and angels ; and 
the next instant he meekly endures the 
dulness of his disciples, and the blasphe- 
mies and rage of the multitude. He 
now calls himself gi-eater than Solomon ;

one who can command legions of angels ; 
and giver of life io whomsoever he 
pleaseth ; the Son of God, who shall sit 
on his glorious throne to judge the 
world: at other times we find him em- 
bracing young children ; not lifting up 
his voice in the streets, nor quenching 
the smoking flax ; calling his disciples 
not sei*vants, but friends and brethren, 
and comforting them with an exuberant 
and parental aflection. Let us pause an 
instant, and fill our minds with the idea 
of, one who knew all things, heavenly 
and earthly ; searched and laid open the 
inmost recesses of the heart ; rectified 
eveiy prejudice, and removed every 
mistake of a moral and religious kind ; 
by a woi^ ^exercised a sovereignty over 
all nature, penetrated the hidden events 
of futurity, gave promises of admission 
into a happy immortality, had the keys 
of life and death, claimed an union with 
the Father ; and yet was pious, mild, 
gentle, humble, affable, social, benevo- 
lent, friendly, and affectionate. Such a 
character is fairer than the morning 
star. Each separate virtue is made 
stronger by opposition and contrast : 
and the union oi so many virtues forms 
a brightness which fitly represents the 
glory of that God * who inliabiteth light 
inaccessible.' " See Robinsoji's J lea

JEWS, a name derived from the pa- 
triarch Judah, and given to the descend- 
ants of Abraham by his eldest son 
Isaac. We shall here present the read- 
er with as comprehensive a view of this 
singTilar people as we can. 

1. Jews, history of the. — The Al- 
mighty promised Abraham that he 
would render his seed extremely nu- 
merous : this promise began to be ful- 
filled in Jacob's twelve sons. In about 
two hundred and fifteen years they in- 
creased in Egypt from seventeen to hc- 
tween two and three millions, men, wo- 
men, and children. While Joseph lived, 
they were kindly used by the Egyp- 
tian monarchs ; but soon after, from a 
suspicion that they would become too 
strong for the natives, they were con- 



demned to slavery ; but the more they 
were oppressed, the more they grew. 
The midwives, and others, were there- 
fore oi-dered to murder every male in- 
fant at the time of its birth ; but they, 
shifting the horrible task, every body 
was then ordered to destroy the male 
children wherever they found them. 
After they had been thus oppressed for 
about one hundred years, and on the 
very day that finished the four hundred 
and thirtieth year from God's first pro- 
mise of a seed to Abraham, and about 
four hundred years after the birtli of 
Isaac, God, by terrible plagties on the 
Egyptians, obliged them to liberate the 
Hebrews under the direction of Moses 
and Aaron. Pharaoh pursued them 
with a mighty army ; but the Lord 
opened a passage for them through the 
Red Sea; and the Egyptians, in at- 
tempting to follow them, were "drown- 
ed. After this, we find them in a dry 
and barren desert, without any provi- 
sion for their journey ; but God sup- 
yjlied them with water from a rock, and 
manna and quails from heaven. A little 
after, they routed the Amalekites, who 
fell on their rear. In the wilderness 
(iod delivered them the law, and con- 
firmed the authority of Moses. Three 
tliousand of them were cut off for wor- 
shipping the golden calf; and for loath- 
ing the manna, they were punished 
with a month's eating of flesh, till a 
plague brake out among them ; and for 
their rash belief of the ten wicked spies, 
and their contemjjt of the promised 
land, God had entirely destroyed them, 
had not Moses's prayers prevented. 
They were condemned, howevei", to 
wander in the desert till the end of forty 
years, till that whole generation, except 
Caleb and Joshua, should be cut off by 
death. Here they were often punished 
for their rebellion, idolatry, whoredom, 
&amp;c. God's marvellous favours, however, 
were still continued in conducting and 
supplying them with meat ; and the 
streams issuing from the rock Meribah, 
followed their camp about thirty-nine 
years, and their clothes never waxed 
old. On their entrance into Canaan, 
God ordered th.em to cut off every ido- 
latrous Canaanite ; but they spared vast 
numbers of them, who ent'iced them to 
Avickedness, and were sometimes God's 
rod to punish them. For many ages 
they had enjoyed little prnspcrit}', and 
often relapsed' into awful idolatry, wor- 
.shipping Baalim, Ashtaroth. Micah and 
the Danites introduced it not long after 
Joshua's death. 'About this time the 
lewdness of the men of Gibeah occa- 
sioned a war of the eleven tribes against

their brethren of Benjamin : they were 
twice routed by the Benjamites, and 
forty thousand of them were slain. In 
the third, however, all the Benjamites 
Avere slam, except six hundred. Vexed 
for the loss of a tribe, the other Hebrews 
provided wives for these six hundred, at 
the expense of slaying most of the in- 
habitants of Jabesh Gilead. Their re- 
lapses into idolatry also brought on 
them repeated turns of slavery from the 
heathen among or around them. See 
books of Judges and Samuel. Having 
been governed by judges for about three 
hundred and forty years, after the 
death of Joshua they took a fancy to 
have a king. Saul was their first sove- 
reign, under whose reign they had 
perpetual struggles with the Ammon- 
ites, Moabites, and Philistines. After 
.ibout seven years' struggling between 
the eleven tribes that clave to Ishbo- 
sheth, the son of Saul, and the tribe of 
Judah, which erected themselves into a 
kingdom mider David, David became 
sole monarch. Under him they sub- 
dued their neighbours, the Philistines, 
Edomites, and others; and took pos- 
session of the whole dominion which 
had been promised them, from the bor- 
der of Egvpt to the banks of the Eu- 
phrates. XJnder Solomon they had lit- 
tle war : when he died, ten of the He- 
bi^ew tribes formed a kijigdom of Israel, 
or Ephraim, for themselves, under Jero- 
boam, the son of Nebat, in opposition to 
the kingdom of Judah and Benjamin, 
ruled by the family of David. The 
kingdom of Israel, Ephraim, or the ten 
tribes, had never so much as one pious 
king: idolatry was always their esta- 
blished religion. The kingdom of Ju- 
dah had pious and wicked sovereigns by 
turns, though they often relapsed into 
idolatry, which brought great distress 
vipon them. See books of Samuel, 
Kings, and Chronicles. Not only the 
kingdom of Israel, but that of Judah, 
vv-as brought to the very brink of ruin 
after the death of Jehoshaphat. After 
various changes, sometimes for the bet- 
ter, and sometuTies for the worse, the 
kingdom of Israel was ruined, two hun- 
dred and fift)'-iour years after its erec- 
tion, by So, king of Egypt, and Hal- 
■manaser, king of Assyria, who invaded 
it, and destroyed most of the people. 
Judah was invaded by Sennacherib ; 
but Hezekiah's piety, and Isaiah's pray- 
er, were the means of their preserva- 
tion : but under Manasseh, the Jews 
abandoned themselves to horrid im- 
piety : for which they were punished 
by Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, who 
invaded an^J reduced the kingdom, and 



carried Manasseh prisoner to Babylon. 
'Manasseh repented*, and the Lord 
brought him back to his kingdom, 
where he promoted the reformation ; 
but his son Amon defaced all. Josiah, 
however, again promoted it, and car- 
ried it to a higher pitch tlian in the 
reigns of David and Solomon. After Jo- 
siah was slain by Pharaoh Necho, king 
of Egypt, the people returned to idola- 
try, and God gave them up to servitude 
to the Egyptians and the Chaldeans. 
The fate of their kings Jehoahaz, Jeho- 
iakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah, was 
unhappy. Provoked by Zedekiah's 
treachery, Nebuchadnezzar invaded the 
kingdom, murdered vast numliers, and 
reduced them to captivity. "Tlius the 
kingdom of Judah was ruined, A. M. 
3416, about three hundred and eighty- 
eight years after its division from that 
of the ten tribes. In the seventieth 
year from the begun captivity, the 
Jews, according to the edict of Cyrus, 
king of Persia, who had overturned the 
empire of Chaldea, returned to their 
own countiy. See Nehemiah, Ezra. 
Vast numbers of them, who had agree- 
able settlements, remained in Babylon. 
After their return they rebuilt the tem- 
ple and city of Jerusalem, put away their 
strange wives, and renewed their cove- 
nant with God. 

About 3490, or 3546, they escaped the 
ruin designed them by Haman. About 
3653, Darius Ochus, king of Persia, ra- 
vaged part of Judea, and carried off a 
great many prisoners. ^Vlien Alexan- 
der v/as in Canaan, about 3670, he con- 
firmed to them all their privileges ; and, 
having built Alexandria, he settled vast 
numbers of them there. About fourteen 
years after, Ptolemy Laa,us, the Greek 
king of Egypt, ravaged Judea, and car- 
ried one hundred thousand prisoners to 
Egypt, but used them kindly, and as- 
signed them many places of ti-ust. 
About eight years after, he transported 
another multitude of Jews to Egypt, 
and gave them considerable privileges. 
About the same time, Seleucus Nicator,- 
having built about thirty new cities in 
Asia, settled in tliem as many Jews as 
he could ; and Ptolemy Philadelphus, 
of Egypt, about 3720, bought the fi'ee- 
dom of all the Jew slaves in Egypt. 
Antiochus Epiphanes, about 3834, en- 
raged with them for rejoicing at the re- 
port- of his death, and for the peculiar 
form of their worship, in his return 
from Egypt, forced his way into Jeru- 
salem, and murdered forty thousand of 
them ; and about two years after he or- 
dered his troops to pillage the cities of 
Judea, aud murder the men, and sell

the women and children for slaves. 
Multitudes were killed, and ten thou- 
sand prisoners carried oflF; the temple 
was dedicated to Olympius, an idol of 
(ireece, and the Jews exposed to the 
basest treatment. Mattathias, the priest, 
with his sons, chiefly Judas, Jonathan, 
and Simon, who were called Maccabees, 
bravely fought for their religion and li- 
berties. Judas, who succeeded his fa- 
ther about 3840 gave Nicanor and the 
king's troops a terrible defeat, regained 
the temple, and dedicated it anew, re- 
stored the daily worship, and repaired 
JeiTisalem, which was almost in a ruin- 
ous heap. After his death, Jonathan 
and Simon, his brethren, successively 
succeeded him ; and both wisely and 
bravely jgpmoted the welfare of the 
chui'ch ajTQ state. Simon was succeeded 
by his son Hircanus, who subdued Idu- 
mea, and reduced the Samaritans. In 
3899 he was succeeded by his son Jan- 
neus, who reduced the Philistines, the 
country of Moab, Ammon, Gilead, and 
part of Arabia. Under these three 
reigns alone the Jewish nation was in- 
dependent after the captivity. After 
the death of the widow of Janneus, who 
governed nine jears, tlie nation was al- 
most ruined with civil broils. In 3939, 
Aristobulus invited the Romans to as- 
sist him against Hircanus, his elder bro- 
ther. The country was quickly reduced, 
and Jerusalem took by force ; and Pom- 
pey, and a number of his officers, jjushed 
i^eir way into the sanctuaiy, if not into 
me Holy of Holies, to view the furni- 
tui'e thereof. Nine years after, Crassus 
the Roman general, pillaged the temple 
of its valuables. After Judea had for 
more than thirty years been a scene of 
ravage and blood, and twent) -four of 
which had been oppressed by Herod 
the Great, Herod got himself installed 
in the kingdom. About twenty years 
before our Saviour's birth, he, with the 
Jews' consent, began to build the tem- 
ple. About this time the Jews had 
hopes of the Messiah ; and about A. M. 
4000, Christ actually came, whom Herod 
(instigated by the fear of losing his 
throne) sought to murder. The Jews, 
however, a few excepted, rejected the 
Messiah, and put him to death. The 
sceptre was now wholly departed from 
Judah ; and Judea, about twenty-seven 
vears before, reduced to a province. 
The Jews since that time, have been 
scattered, contemned, persecuted, and 
enslaved among all nations, not mixed 
with any in the common manner, but 
have remained as a body distinct by 
themselves. 
3. Jews, sentiments of. The Jews 



commonly reckon but thirteen articles 
of their faith. Maimonidcs, a famous 
Jewish rabbi, reduced them to this num- 
ber when he drew up their confession 
about the end of the eleventh century, 
and it was generally received. All the 
Jews are obliged to live and die in the 
profession of these thirteen articles, 
which are as follow : — 1. That God is 
the creator of all things ; that he guides 
and supports all creatures : that lie has 
done every thing ; and that he still acts, 
and shall act during the whole eternitv. 
— 2. That God is one : there is no unity 
like his. He alone hath been, is, and 
shall be eternally our God. — 3. That 
God is incorporeal, and cannot have any 
material properties; and no corporeal 
essence can be compared with him. — 4. 
That God is the beginning and end of 
all things, and shall etenially subsist. — 
5. That God alone ought to be wor- 
shipped, and none beside him is to be 
adored. — 6. That whatever has been 
taught b\' the prophets is true. — 7. That 
Moses is the head and fathe%of all con- 
temporary doctors, of those who lived 
before or shall live after him. — 8. That 
tlie law was given by Moses. — 9. That 
the law shall never be altered, and that 
God will give no other. — 10. That God 
knows all the thoughts and actions of 
men. — 11. Tliat God will regard the 
works of all those who have performed 
what he commands, and punish those 
who have transgressed his laws. — 12. 
That the Messiah is to come, though he 
tarry a long time. — 13. That there shall 
be a resurrection of the dead when God 
shall think fit. 

The modern Jews adhere still as 
closely to the Mosaic dispensation, as 
their dispersed and despised condition 
will permit them. Their service consists 
chiefly in reading the law in their syna- 
gogues, together with a variety of pray- 
ers. They use no sacrifices since the 
destiniction of the temple. Tliey repeat 
blessings and particular praises' to God, 
not only in their prayers, but on all ac- 
cidental occasions, and in almost all 
their actions. They go to prayers three 
times a day in their synagogues. Their 
sermons are not made in Hebrew, which 
few of them now pert'ectly understand, 
but in the language of the country where 
they reside. They are forbidden all 
vain swearing, and pronouncing anv of 
the nanws of God without necessity. 
Thev abstain fi-om meats prohibited by 
the Levitical law ; for which reason, 
whatever they eat must be dressed by 
Jews, and after a manner peculiar to 
themselves. As soon as a child can 
speak, they teach him to read and trans- 



JEW

JEW 



late the Bible into the language of the 
country where they live. In general 
they observe the same ceremonies 
which were practised by their ancestors 
in the celebration of the passover. They 
acknowledge a two-fold law of God, a 
written and an unwritten one ; the for- 
mer is contained in the Pentateuch, or 
five books of Moses; the lattei-, tliey 
pretend, was delivered by God to Mo- 
ses, and handed down from him by oral 
tradition, and now to be received as of 
equal authority with the former. They 
assert the perpetuity of their law, to- 
gether with its perfection. They deny 
the accomplishment of the prophecies 
in the person of Christ ; alleging that 
the JVIessiah is not yet come, and that 
he will make his appearance with the 
greatest worldly pomp and grandeur, 
subduing all nations before him, and 
subjecting them to the house of Judah. 
Since the prophets have predicted his 
inean condition and sufferings, they con- 
fidentlv talk of two Messiahs ; one 
Ben-Ephr»im, whom they grant to be 
a person of a mean and afflicted condi- 
tion in this world ; and the other Ben- 
David, who shall be a A-ictoi-ious and 
powerful prince. 

The Jews pray for the souls of the 
dead, because they suppose tliere is a 
paradise for the souls of good men, 
where thev enjoy glory in the presence 
of God. They believe that the souls of 
the wicked are tormented in hell with 
fire and other ]}unishments ; that some 
are condemned to be punished in this 
manner for ever, while others continue 
only for a limited time ; and this they 
call /2iirg-a(07-y, \v\\\c\\ is not • different 
fi-om hell in respect of the place, but of 
the duration. They suppose no Jew, 
unless guilty of heresy, or certain crimes 
specified by the rabbins, shall continue 
in purgatory above a twelvemonth ; and 
that there are but few who suffer eter- 
nal punishment. 

Almost all the modem Jews are Pha- 
yisees, and are as much attached to 
tradition as their ancestors were ; and 
assert that whoever rejects the oral law 
deserves death. Hence they entertain 
an implacable hatred to the Cai'aites, 
who adhere to the text of Moses, re- 
jecting the rabbinistical interpretation. 
See Caraites. 

There are still some of the Sadducees 
in Africa, and in several other places ; 
but they are few in mimber : at least 
there are but very few who declare 
openly for these opinions. 

There are to this day some remains 
of the ancient sect of the Samaritans, 
who are zealous for the law of Moses, 



but are despised by the Jews, because 
they receive only the Pentateuch, and 
observe different cei*emonies from theirs. 
They declare they are no Sadducees, 
but acknowledge the spirituality and 
immortality of the soul. There are 
numbers of this sect at Gaza, Damas- 
cus, Grand Cairo, and in some other 
places of the east ; but especially at 
Sichem, now called Naplouse, which is 
risen out of the ruins of the ancient Sa- 
maria, where they sacrificed not many 
years ago, having a place for this pur- 
pose on Mount Genzim. 

David Levi, a leai'ned Jew, Avho in 
1796 published "Dissertations on the 
Prophecies of the Old Testament," ob- 
serves in that work, that deism and in- 
fidelity have made such larg||6trides in 
the world, that they have at length 
reached even to the Jewish nation ; 
many of whom are at this time so greatly 
infected with scepticism, by reading 
Rolingbroke, Hume, Voltaire, Sec. that 
they scarcely believe in a revelation; 
much less have they any hope in their 
future restoration. 

3. Jeivs, calamities of. — All history 
cannot furnish us with a parallel to the 
calamities and miseries of the Jews ; ra- 
pine and murder, famine and pestilence, 
within ; fire and sword, and all the ter- 
rors of war, without. Our Saviour wept 
at the foresight of these calamities ; and 
it is almost impossible for persons of 
any humanity to read the account with- 
out being afrected. The predictions &amp;^t^ 
cerning them were remarkable, and the 
calamities that came upon them were 
the greatest the world ever saw. Deut. 
XXV iii. xxix. Matt. xxiv. Now, what 
heinous sin was it tliat could be the 
cause of such heavy judgments? Can 
any other be assigned than what the 
Scripture assigns? 1 Thess. ii. 15, 16. 
" They both killed the Lord Jesus and 
their own prophets, and persecuted the 
apostles: and so filled up their shis, and 
wrath came upon them to the -utter- 
most." It is hardly possible to consider 
the nature and extent of their sufferings, 
and not conclude the Jews' own im- 
precation to be shigularly fulfilled upon 
them, Matt, xxvii. 25. '" His blood be 
on us and our children." At Cesarea 
twenty thousand of the Jev/s were killed 
by the Syrians in their mutual broils. 
At Damascus ten thousand unarmed 
Jew's wej-e killed : and at Bethshan the 
Heathen inhabitants caused their Jew- 
ish neighbours to assist them against 
their brethren, and then murdered thii"- 
teen thousand of these inhabitants. At 
Alexandria the Jews murdered multi- 
tudes of the Heathens, and were mur-

dcred in their turn to about fifty thou- 
sand. The Romans under Vespasian 
invaded the country', and took the cities 
of Galilee, Chorazen, Bethsaida, Ca- 
pernaum, 5cc. whei'e Christ had been 
especially rejected, and murdered num- 
bers of the inhabitants. At Jerusalem 
the scene was most wretched of all. At 
the passover, when there might be two 
or three millions of people in the city, 
the Romans surrounded it with troops, 
trenches, and walls, that none might es- 
cape. The three different factions with- 
in murdered one another. Titus, one of 
the most merciful generals that ever 
breathed, did all in his power to per- 
suade \hem to an advantageous surren- 
der, but they scorned every proposal. 
The multitudes of unburied carcasses 
corrupted the air, and produced a pesti- 
lence. The people fed on one another; 
and ev^n ladies, it is said, broiled their 
sucking infants, and ate them. After a- 
siege of six months, the city was taken. 
They murdered almost every Jew they 
met with. Titus was bent to save tlie 
temple, but could not : tliere were six 
thousand Jews wlio had taken shelter 
in it, all burnt or murdered ! I'he out- 
cries of the Jews, when they saw it, 
Avei'e most di-eadful : the wliole city, 
except three towers and a small part of 
the wall, was razed to the ground, and 
the foundations of the temple and other 
places were ploughed up. Soon after 
the forts of Herodian and Macheron 
were taken, the garrison of Massada 
Tfiurdered themselves rather than sur- 
render. At Jerusalem alone, it is said, 
one million one hundred thousand pe- 
rished by sword, famine, and pestilence. 
In other places we hear of two hundred 
and iifty thousand that were cut oft', be- 
sides vast numbers sent into Egypt to 
labour as slaves. About fifty years af- 
ter, the Jews murdered about five hun- 
dred thousand of the Roman subjects, 
for which they were severely punished 
by Ti'ajan. About 130, one Barocaba 
pretended that he was the Messiah, 
and raised a Jewish army of two hun- 
dred thousand, who murdered all the 
Heathens and Christians who came in 
their way ; but he was defeated by 
Adrian's forces. In this war, it is said, 
about sixty thousand Jews were slain, 
and perished. Adrian built a city on 
Mount Calvary, and erected a marble 
statue of swine over the gate that led to 
Bethlehem. No Jew was allowed to en- 
ter the city, or to look to it at a distance, 
under pain of death. In 360 they began 
to rebuild their city and temple ; but a 
terrible eaithquake and flames of fire 
issuing from the earth, killed the work- 



men, and scattered their materials. Nor 
till the seventfi century durst they so 
mucli as creep over the rubbish to be- 
wail it, without bribing the guards. In 
the third, foin-th, and fifth centuries, 
there were many of them furiously 
harassed and murdered. In the sixth, 
century twenty thousand of them were 
slain, and as many taken and sold for, 
slaves. In 602 they were sevei'ely pun- 
ished for their horrible massacre ot the 
Christians at Antioch. In Spain, in 700, 
they were ordered to be enslaved. In 
the eighth and ninth centuries they were 
greatly derided and abused; in some 
places they were made to wear leathern 
gii'dles, and ride without stirnips on 
asses and mules. In France and Spain 
they v/ere much insulted.. In the tenth, 
eleventh, and twelfth centuries, their 
miseries rather increased : they were 
greatly persecuted in Egypt. Besides 
what they suffered hi the East by the 
Turkish and sacred war, it is shocking 
to think what multitudes of them the 
eight croisades murdered in Germany, 
Hungary, Lesser Asia, and elsewhere. 
In France multitudes were burnt.— In 
England, in 1020, they were banished; 
and at the coronation' of Richard I. the 
mob fell upon them, and murdered a 
great mai:- of them. About one thou- 
sand five hundred of them were burnt 
in the palace in the city of York, which 
they set fire to, themselves, after killing 
their wives and children. In the thir- 
teenth and fourteenth centuries their 
condition was no better. In Egypt, Ca- 
naan, and Syria, the croisaders still ha- 
rassed them. Provoked with their mad 
ninning after pretended Messiahs, Ca- 
liff Nasser scarc^- left any of them 
alive in his dominions of Mesopotamia. 
In Persia, the Tartai's murdered them 
in multitudes. In Spain, Ferdinand 
persecuted them furiously. About 1349, 
the terrible massacre of them at Toledo 
forced many of them to murder them- 
selves, or change their religion. About 
1253, many were murdered, and others 
banished from France, but in 1275 re- 
called. In 1320 and 1330, the ci'oisades 
of the fanatic shepherds, who wasted 
the south of France, massacred them ; 
besides fifteen hundred that were mur- 
dered on another occasion. In 1358 
they were totally banished from France, 
since which few of them ha\'e entered 
that country. In 1291 king Edward ex- 
pelled them from England, to the num- 
ber of one hundred and sixty thousand. 
In the fifteenth, sixteenth, and sei'en- 
teenth centuries, their misery continued. 
In Persia they liave been terribly used : 
ft-om 1663 to '1666, the murder o'f them

was so universal, that but a few escaped 
to Turkey. In Portugal'and Spain they 
have been miserably handled. About 
1392, six or eight ' hundred thousand 
were banished from Spain. Some were 
drowned in their passage to Africa ; 
some by hard usage ; and many of their 
carcasses lay in the fields till the wild 
beasts devoured them. In (Germany 
they have endured many hardships. 
They have been banished from Bohe- 
mia, Bavaria, Cologne, Nuremberg, 
Augsburg, and Vienna : they have been 
terribly massaci-ed' in Moravia, and 
plundered in Bonn and Bamberg. Ex- 
cept in Portugal and Spain, their pre- 
sent condition is generally tolerable. In 
Holland, Poland, and at Frankfort and 
Hamburgh they have their liberty. 
They have repeatedly, but in vain, at- 
tempted to obtain a naturalization in 
England, and other nations among 
whom they are scattered. 

4. Jeivs, fireservatio7i of. — " The pre- 
servation of the Jews," says Basnage, 
"in the midst of the misei'ies which 
they have undergone during 1700 years, 
is the greatest prodigj" that can be ima- 
gined. Religions depend on temporal 
prosperity ; they triumph under the 
protection of a contjueror : they languish 
and sink with sinknig monar -hies. Pa- 
ganism which once covered the earth, is 
extinct. The Christian church, glorious 
in its mai'tyrs, yet was considerably di- 
minished by the persecutions to which 
it was exposed ; nor was it easy to re- 
pair the breaches in it made by those 
acts of violence. But here we behold a 
church hated and persecuted for 1700 
years, and yet sustaining itself, and wide- 
ly extended. Kings have often employ- 
ed the severity of edicts and the hand of 
executioners to ruin it. The seditious 
multitudes, by murders and massacres, 
have committed outrages against it still 
more violent and tragical. Princes and 
people. Pagans, Mahometans, Chris- 
tians, disagreeing in so many things, 
have united in the design of extermina- 
ting it, and have not been able to suc- 
ceed. The bush of IMoses, surrounded 
with flames, ever burns, and is never 
consumed. The Jews have been expel- 
led, in different times, from every part 
of the world, which hath only ser\'ed to 
spread them in all regions. From age 
to age they have been exposed to mise- 
vy and persecution ; yet still they sub- 
sist, in spite of the ignominy and the ha- 
tred which hath pursued them in all 
places, whilst the greatest monarchies 
are fallen, and nothing remains of them 
besides the name. 
" The judgments which God has ex- 



ercised upon this people are terrible, 
extending to the men, the religion, and 
the very land in which they dwelt. The 
ceremonies essential to their religion 
can no more be observed : the ritual 
law, which cast a splendour on the na- 
tional worship, and stnick the Pagans 
so much that they sent their presents 
and their victims to Jerusalem, is abso- 
lutely fallen, for they have no temple, 
no altar, no sacrifices. Their land itself 
seems to lie under a never-ceashig curse. 
Pagans, Christians, Mohammedans, in 
a word, almost all nations have by 
turns seized and held Jerusalem. To 
the Jew only hath God refused tj^e pos- 
session of this small tract of ground, so 
supremely necessary for him, since he 
ought to worship on this mountain. A 
Jewish writer hath affirmed, that it is 
long since any Jew has been settled 
near Jerusalem : scarcely can tHfey pur- 
chase there six feet of land for a bury- 
ing-place. 

" In all this there is no exaggeration : 
I am only pointing out known facts : 
and, far from having the least design to 
raise an odium against the nation from 
its miseries, I conclude that it ought to 
be looked upon as one of those prodigies 
which we admire without comprehend- 
ing : since, in spite of evils so durable, 
and a patience so long exercised, it is 
pi'eserved by a particular providence. 
The Jew ought to be weary of expect- 
ing a Messiah, who so unkindly disap- 
points his vain hopes : and the Chiistian 
ought to have his attention and his re- 
gard excited towards men whom God 
preserves, for so great a length of time, 
under calamities which would have been 
the total ruin of any.otlier people." 

5. Jews, number and disjiersion of.—- 
They are looked upon to be as numei-- 
ous at present as they were formerly in 
the land of Canaan. Some have rated 
them at three millions, and others more 
than double that number. I'heir disper- 
sion is a remarkable particular in this 
people. They swarm all o\ er the east, 
and are settled, it is said, in the remo- 
test parts of China. The Turkish em- 
pire abounds with them. There are 
more of them at Constantinople and 
Salonichi than in any other place : they 
are spread through most of the nations 
of Europe and Africa, and many fami- 
lies of them are established in the West 
Indies; not to mention whole nations 
bordering on Prester John's country, 
and some discovered in the inner parts 
of America, if we may give any credit 
to their own writers. ' Their being al- 
ways in rebellions (as Addison observes) 
while thev had the Holv Temple in

view, has excited most nations to banish 
them. Besides, the whole people are 
now a race of such merchants as are 
wanderers by profession ; and at the 
same time are in most, if not in all pla- 
ces, incapable of either lands or offices, 
that might enejage them to make any 
part of the world their home. In addi- 
tion to this, we may consider what pro- 
vidential reasons may be assigned for 
their numbers and dispersion. Their 
firm adherence to their religion, and 
being dispersed all over the earth, has 
furnished every age and every nation 
with the strongest arguments for the 
Christian faith ; not only as these very 
particulars are foretold of them, but 
as they themselves are the depositories 
of these and all other prophecies which 
tend to their own confusion and the es-

6. Jews, restoration of. — From the 
declarations of Scripture we liave rea- \ 
son to suppose the Jew§ shall be called 
to a participation of the blessings of the 
Gospel, Rom. xi. 2 Cor. iii. 16. Hos. i. 
11, and some suppose shall return to 
their own land. Has. iii. 5. Is. Ixv. 17, 
&amp;c. Ezek. xxxvi. A^ to the time, some 
think about 1866 or 2016 ; but this, per- 
haps, is not so easy to determine alto- 
getl^vthough it is probable it will not 
be ^^ire the fall of Antichrist and the 
OttOTPS empire. Let us, however, 
avoid putting stumbling-blocks in their 
way. If we attempt any thing for their 
conversion, let it be with peace and 
love. Let us, says one, propose Christi- 
anity to them as Christ proposed it to 
them. Let us lay before them their own 
prophecies. Let us show them their ac- 
complishment ill Jesus. Let us applaud 
their hatred of idolatiy. Let us show 
them the morality of Jesus in our lives 
and tempers. Let us never abridge their 
civil liberty, nor ever try to force their 
consciences. Josefihus's History of the

IGNORANCE, the want of know- 
ledge or instruction. It is often used to 
denote illiteracy. Mr. Locke obser\^^ 
that the causes of ignorance are cWefly 
three. — 1. Want of ideas. — 2. Want of 
a discoverable connection between the 
ideas we have. — 3. Want of tracing and 
examining our ideas. As it respects re- 
ligion, ignorance has been distinguished 
into three sorts : 1. An invincible igno- 
rance, in which the will has no part. It 
is an insult upon justice to, suppose it 
will punish men because they were ig- 
norant of things which they were phy- 
sically incapable of knowing. — 2. There 
is a wilful and obstinate ignorance ; such 
an ignorance, far from exculpating, ag- 
gravates a man's crimes. — 3. A sort of 
ignorance which is neither entirely wil- 
ful, nor entirely invincible ; as when a 
man has the means of knowledge, and 
does not use them. See Knowlkdgf, ; 
and Locke on the Und. vol. ii. p. 178 ;

ILLUMINAl'I, aterm anciently ap- 
plied to such as had received baptism. 
The name was occasioned by a ceremo- 
ny in the baptism of adults, which con- 
sisted in putting a lighted taper in the 
hand of the person baptized, as a sym- 
bol of the faith and grace he had re- 
ceived in the sacrament. 

ILLUMINATI was also the name of 
a sect which appeared in Spain about 
the year 1575. T hey were charged with 
maintaining that mental prayer and 
contemplation had so intimately united 
them to God, that they were arrived to 
such a state of perfection, as to stand in 
no need of good works, or the sacra- 
ments of the church, and that they 
might commit the grossest crimes with- 
out sin. 

After the suppression of the Illumi- 
nati in Spain, there appeared a denomi- 
nation in France which took the same 
name. They maintained that one An- 
thony Buckuet had* a system of belief 
and practice revealed to him which ex- 
ceeded every thing Christianity had yet 
been acquainted with : that Ijy this me- 
thod persons might in a short time ar- 
rive at the same degrees of perfection 
and gloiy to which the saints and tlie 
Blessed Virgin have attained ; and thiti 
improvement might be carried on till 
our actions became divine, and our 
minds wholly given up to the influence 
of the Almighty. They said further, 
that none of the doctors of the church 
Ii

knew an}- thing of religion ; that Paul 
and Peter were well-meaning men, but 
knew nothing of devotion ; that the 
whole church lay in darkness and un- 
belief; that every one was at liberty to 
follow the suggestions of his conscience ; 
tfljft God regarded nothing but himself; 
and Miat within ten years their doctrine 
would be recei\'ed all over the world ; 
then there would be no more occasion 
for priests, monks, and such other reli- 
gious distinctions. 

ILLUMINATI, a name assumed by 
a secret society, founded on the first of 
Ma\', 1776, by Dr. Adam Weishaupt, 
professor o^ canon law in the university 
of Ingoldstadt. The avowed object of 
this order was, " to diffuse from secret 
societies, as from so many centres, the 
light of science over the world ; to pro- 
pagate the purest principles of virtue ; 
and to reinstate mankind in the happi- 
ness which they enjoyed during the gol- 
den age fabled by the poets.' Such a 
philanthropic object was doubtless well 
adapted to make a deep impression on 
the minds of ingenious young men ; and 
to such alone did Dr. Weisliaupt at first 
address himself. But "the real ob- 
ject," we are assured by Professor Ro- 
bison and Abbe Barruel, "was, by 
chmdestine arts, to o^'erturn every go- 
vernment and every religion ; to bring 
the sciences of civil life into contempt ; 
and to reduce mankind to that imagina- 
ry state of nature, when they lived in- 
dependent of each other on the sjjonta- 
neous productions of the earth." Free 
Masonry being in high reputation all 
over Europe when Weishaupt first 
formed the plan of his society, he avail- 
ed himself of its secrecy to introduce 
his new order; of which he constituted 
himself general, after initiating some of 
his pupils, whom he styled AreofiagUes, 
in its mysteries. And when report 
spread the news throughout Germany 
of the Institution of the Order of lUumi- 
nees, it was generally considered as a 
mere college lodge, which could interest 
the students no loi&gt;ger than during the 
period of their studies. Weishaupt's 
character, too, whicK at this time was 
respectable for morality as well as eru- 
dition, prevented all suspicion of his 
harbouring any such dark designs as 
have since come to light. But it would 
far exceed the limits to which this work 
is restricted, to give even an outline of 
the nature and constitution of this ex- 
traordinary society ; of its secrets and 
mysteries; «f the deep dissimulation, 
consummate hypocrisy, and shocking 
impiety of its founder and his associates ; 
of their Jesuitical art \x\ concealing thdr 



real objects, and their incredible indus- 
try and astonishing exertions in making 
converts ; of the absolute despotism and 
complete system of espionnage esta- 
blished throughout the order ; of its dif- 
ferent degrees of JVovices, Minervals, 
Minor a.xvS. Major Illuminees ; Epo/its, 
or Priests, Regents, Magi, and Man- 
kings ; of the Recruiters or Insinuators, 
with their various subtle methods of in- 
sinuating into all characters and com- 
panies ; of the blind obedience exacted 
of the Novices, and the absolute power 
of life and death assumed by the order, 
and conceded by the Novices ; of the 
dictionary, geography, kalendar, and 
cipher of the order ; of the new names 
assumed bv the niemtjers, such as Spar- 
taciis by Weishaupt, because he pre- 
tended to wage war against oppressors; 
Cato by Zwack ; Ajax by Massenhau- 
sen, &amp;C. of the Minen^al Academy and 
Libraiy ; of the questions proposed to 
the candidates for degrees, and the va- 
rious ceremonies of admission to each ; 
and of the pretended morality, real 
blasphemies, and absolute atheism, of 
the founder and his tried friends. Such 
of our readers as wish to be fully in- 
formed of these matters, we must refer 
to the Abbe Barruel's works, and to 
Prof. Robisnn's Proofs of a Conspiracy 
against all the Religions anU Govern- 
ments of Europe. "But while credit may 
be given to the general facts related in 
these works, some doubts respecting 
the ultimate objects of Dr. W' eishaupt 
and his associates in this conspfracy 
may be expressed : as. That men of 
their principles should secretly con- 
spire to oA'erthrow all the religions and 
governments at present in Europe, is by 
no means incredible ; that they should 
even prevail on many well-meaning 
philanthropists, who are no enemies to 
rational religion or good government, to 
join them, is also veiy credible. Rut 
that a set of men of learning and abili- 
ties, such as Weishaupt and his asso- 
ciates are allowed to be, should form a 
conspiracy to overturn, and with more 
than Gothic rage utterly abolish the 
arts and sciences, and to restore the 
supposed original savage state of man, 
appears to us a phenomenon in the his- 
tory of the human heart totally unac- 
countable. That "the heart of man is 
deceitful abo\'e all things, and despe- 
rately wicked," is a melancholy truth, 
which not ^r^pture alone, but the his- 
tory of mankind ^ all ages and nations, 
affords full proof of, as well as the 
shocking history of the lUuminati ; but 
while pride and vanity have a place in 
the human heart, to say nothing of our

other passions, which are more or less 
interested in the preservation of the 
discoveries and improvements in arts, 
sciences, and their mseparable concom- 
itant luxury, we are persuaded no man, 
or body of men, who have enjoyed the 
sweets of civilized life, ever formed a 
serious wish for the total abolition of the 
arts and sciences. In the fuiy and rage 
of war, Goths, Vandals, and 1 urks, may 
bum and destroy monuments of art and 
repositories of science ; but when the 
wars are over, instead of i-eturning to 
the savage state, the barbarous con- 
querors mix and amalgamate with the 
conquered, and become themselves 
more or less civilized. Dr. Weishaupt 
is allowed to be influenced by a high de- 
gree of vanit}' ; as an evidence of which 
he communicates as the last secret to 
his most favoured adepts, that the mys- 
teries of Illuminism, which, in going 
through the inferior degrees, had been 
suoceHsi\ ely attributed to the most an- 
cient "patriarchs and philosophers, and 
even to Christ himself, owed its origin 
to no other than Adam Weishaupt, 
known in the oj'der by the name of Spar- 
tacus. The same vanity which leads the 
doctor to take this traditional method, 
while secrecy is deemed necessary, of 
securing to himself the honour of having 
founded the society, would lead him, 
were the Illuminati actually victorious 
over all religions and governments, to 
wish to ha\"e his memory recorded in a 
mom^ durable manner by writing or 
jSJIhg. But if these and all the other 
arts were to perish in a mass, then the 
memory of the doctor, and the important 
services he had done to the order and 
to savagism, must, within a century at 
the utmost, perish along with them. But 
if, in fact, the total annihilation of the 
arts and sciences, as well as of all reli- 
gion and government, be reall}' the olj- 
ject of Weishaupt and his Illuminees, 
then we may agree with the celebrated 
Mandeville, that " human nature is the 
true Libyan desert, daily producing 
new monsters "smA that of these mon- 
sters the doctor and his associates are 
beyond a doubt the most extraordinary. 
Professor Robison informs us, that " the 
order of the Illuminati was abolished in 
1786 by the elector of Bavaria, but re- 
vived immediately after, under another 
name, and in a different form, all over 
Germany. It was again detected and 
seemingly broken up ; but it had by this 
time taken so deep root, that it still sub- 
sists without being detected, and has 
spread, we are told, into all the coun- 
tries of pAirope. 
IMAGE, m a religious sense, is an 



artificial representation of some person 
or thing used as an object of adoration ; 
in which sense it is used synonymously 
witln idol. The use and adoration of ima- 
ges have been long controverted. It is 
plain, from the pi'actice of the primitive 
church, recorded by the earlier fathers, 
that Christians, during the first thi-ee 
centuries, and the greater part of the 
fourth, neither worshipped, miages, nor 
used them in their worship. However, 
the generality of the popish divines 
maintain that the use and worship of 
images are as ancient as the Christian 
religion itself: to prove this, they allege 
a decree, said to have been made in a 
council held by the apostles at Antioch, 
commanding the faithful, that they may 
not err about the object of their wor- 
ship, to make images of Christ, and wor- 
ship them. Baron, ad. ann. 102. But 
no notice is taken of this decree till 
seven hundred years after the apostolic 
j times, after the dispute about images 
had commenced. The first instance that 
occurs, in any credible author, of ima- 
ges among Cliristians, is that recorded 
by Tertullian de Pudicit. c. 10, of cer- 
tain cups or chalices, as Bellarmine pre- 
tends, on which was repi-esented the 
parable of the good shepherd carrying 
the lost sheep on his shoulders : but this 
instance only proves that the church, at 
that time, did not think emblematical 
figures unlawful ornaments of chalices. 
Another instance is t^ken from Euse- 
bius (^Hist. Eccl. lib. vii. cap. 18,) who 
says, that in his time thei'e were to be 
seen two brass statues in the city of Pa- 
neas, or Csesarea Philippi; the one of a 
woman on her knees, with her arm 
stretched out; the other of a man over 
against her, with his hand extended to 
receive her: these statues were said to 
be the images of our Saviour, and the 
woman whom he cured of an issue of 
blood. From the foot of the statue re- 
presenting our Saviour, says the histo- 
rian, sprung up an exotic plant, which 
as soon as it gTCw to touch the border of 
his garment, was said to cure all sorts of 
distempers. Eusebius, however, vouches 
none of these things; nay, he supposes 
that the woman who erected this statue 
of our Saviour was a pagan, and ascribes 
it to a pagan custom. Philostorgius 
{Eccl. Hist. lib. viL c. 3.) expressly says, 
that this statue was carefully preserved, 
by the Christians, but that they paid 
no kind of worship to it, because it 
is not lawful for Christians to worship 
brass. Or any other matter. The primi- 
tive Christians abstained from the wor- 
ship of images, not, as the Papists pre- 
tend, from tenderness to heathen idola- 



IMA

ters, but because they thought it unlaw- 
ful in itself to make any images of the 
Deity. TertuUian, Clemens Alexandri- 
nus, and Origen, were of opinion, that, 
by the second commandment, painting 
and engraving were unlawful to a Chris- 
tian, styling them evil and wicked arts. 
Teit. de Idol. cap. 3. Clem. Alex. Ad- 
mon. ad Gent. p. 41. Origen contra 
Celsum, lib. vi. p. 182. The use of ima- 
ges in churches, as ornaments, was firet 
introduced by some Christians in Spain, 
in the beginning of the fourth century ; 
but the practice was condemned as a 
dangerous innovation, in a council held 
at Eliberis, in 305. Epiphanius, in a let- 
ter preserved by Jerome, torn. ii. ep. 6, 
bears strong testimony against images ; 
and he may be considered as one of the 
first iconoclasts. The custom of admit- 
ting pictures of saints and martyrs into 
churches (for this was the first source 
of image worship) was rare in the end 
of the loui'tli centurv, but became com- 
mon in the fifth. But they were still 
considered only as ornaments, and, 
even in this view, they met with very 
considerable opposition. In the follow- 
ing century, the custom of thus adorning 
churches became almost universal, both 
in the East and West. Petavius ex- 
pressly says (f/e Incur, lib. xv. cap. 14.) 
that no statues were yet allowed in the 
churches, because they bore too near a 
resemblance to the idols of the Gentiles. 
Towards the close of the fourth, or be- 
ginning of the fifth century, images, 
which were introduced by way of orna- 
ment, and then used as an aid to devo- 
tion began to be actually worshipped. 
However, it continued to be the qoc- 
trine of the church in the sixth, and in 
the beginning of the seventh century, 
that images were to be used only as 
helps to devotion, and not as objects of 
■woreliip. Tlie worship of them was con- 
demned in the strongest terms by Gre- 
gory the Great, as appeai-s by two of 
his letters written in 601. From this 
time to the beginning of the eighth cen- 
tury, there occurs no instance of any 
worship given, or allowed to be given to 
images, by any coimcil or assemblv of 
bishops whatever. But they were com- 
monly woi-shipped by the monks and 
populace in the beginning of the eighth 
century; insomuch, that in 726, when 
Leo published his famous edict, it had 
already spread into all the provinces 
subject to the empire. The Lutherans 
condemn the Calvinists for breaking the 
images in the churches of the Catholics, 
looking on it as a kind.of sacrilege ; and 
yet they condemn the Romanists (who 
are professed image-vjorshipfiers) as 



idolaters : nor can these last keep pace 
with the Greeks, who go far beyond 
them in this point, which has occasioned 
abundance of disputes among them. See 
IcoNOCLASTEs. The Jews absolutely 
condemn all images, and do not so much 
as suffer any statues or figures in their 
houses, much less in their synagogues, 
or places of woi-ship. The Mahometans 
have an equal aversion to images; 
which led them to destroy most of the 
beautiful monuments of antiquity, both 
saci-ed and profane, at Constantinople. —

IMAGE OF GOD in the soul, is dis- 
tinguished into natural and moral. By 
natural is meant the understanding, rea- 
son, will, and other intellectual faculties. 
By the moral image, the right use of 
those faculties, or what we term holiness. 

IMAfilNATION is a power or fa- 
culty of the mind, whereby it conceives 
and forms ideas of things communicated 
to it bv the outward organs of sense; or 
it is the power of recollecting and as- 
sembling images, and of painting for- 
cibly those images on our minds, or on 
the minds of others. The cause of the 
pleasures of the imagination in what- 
ever is great, uncommon, or beautiful, 
is this ; tliat God has annexed a secret 
pleasure to the idea of anv thing tiwt.is 
new or rare, that he might encoimige 
and stimulate us in the eager and keen 
pursuits after knowledge, and inflame 
our best passions to search into the won- 
ders of creation and revelation; for every 
new idea brings such a pleasure along 
with it, as rewards any pains we have 
taken in its acquisition, and consequently 
serves as a striking and powerful motive 
to put us upon fresh discoveries in learn- 
ing and science, as well as in the word 
and works of God. See /?n». IV. Jones's

IMMATERIALISM, the belief that 
the soul is a spiritual substance distinct 
from the body. See Materialism and 
Soul. 

IMMENSITY, unbounded or incom- 
prehensible greatness; and unlimited 
extension, which no finite and determi- 
nate space, repeated ever so often, can 
equnl. See Infixity of God. 

IMMORALITY, an action iiicon-

sistent with our duty towards tnen, and 
consequently a sin against God, who 
hath commanded us to do justly, and 
love mercv. See Morality. 

IMMORTALITY, a state which 
has no end ; the impossibility of dying. 
It is applied to God, who is absolutely 
immortal, 1 Tim. i. 17. and to the hu- 
man soul, which is only hypotlietically 
immortal ; as God, who at hrst gave it, 
can, if he pleases, deprive us of our ex- 
istence. See Soul. 

IMMUTABILITY OF GOD, is his 
unchangeableness. He is immutable in 
his essence, James i. 17. In his attributes, 
Ps. cii. 27. In his fiur/)oses, Isa. xxv. 1. 
Ps. xxxiii. 11. In \ih /iro?7iises, Mai. iii. 
6. 2 Tim. ii. 12. And in his threateiiings. 
Matt. xxv. 41. " This is a perfection," 
says Dr. Blair, " which, perhaps, more 
than any other, distinguishes the divine 
nature from the human, gives complete 
energj' to all its attributes, and entitles 
it to the highest adoration. From hence 
are dewved the regular order of nature, 
and the steadfastness of the universe. 
Hence flows the unchanging tenor of 
those laws which from age to age regu- 
late the conduct of mankind. Hence the 
uniformity of that government, and the 
certainty of those promises, which are 
the gi-ound of our trust and security. 
An objection, however, may be raised 
against this doctrine, from the com- 
mands given us to pi-ayer, and other re- 
ligious exercises. To what pui-pose, it 
may be urged, is homage addressed to 
a Being whose plan is unalterablv fixed? 
This objection would have weight, if 
our religious addresses were designed 
to work any alteration in God, either bv 
giving him information of what he did 
not know, or by exciting affections which 
he did not possess ; or by inducing him 
to change measure? which he had pre- 
viously formed : but they are only crude 
and imperfect notions of religion which 
can suggest such ideas. The change 
which our devotions are intended to 
make, are upon ourselves, not upon the 
Almighty. By pouring out our senti- 
ments and desires before God, by ador- 
ing his perfections, and confessing our 
unwortnmess; by expressing our de- 

{)endence on his aid ; our gratitude for 
lis past favours, our submission to his 
present will, and our trust in his future 
mercy, we cultivate such affections as 
suit our place and station in the universe, 
and are to be exercised by us as men 
and as Christians. The contemplation 
of this divine perfection should raise in 
our minds admiration ; should teach us 
to imitate, as far as our frailtv will per- 
mit, that constancy and steadfastness 



which we adore, 2 Cor. iii. 18; and, 
lastly, should excite trust and confidence 
in the Divine Being, amidst all the revo- 
• Mtions of this uncertain world." Blair's

IMPANATION, a term used by di- 
vines to signify the opinion of tlie Lu- 
therans with regard to the eiicharist, 
who believe that the species of bread 
and wine remain together with the body 
of our Saviour after consecration. 

IMPECCABILES, a name given to 
those heretics who boasted that they 
were impeccable, and that there was 
no need of repentance ; such were the 
Gnostics, Priscillianists, &amp;c. 

IMPECCABILITV, the state of a 
person who cannot sin ; or a grace, 
privilege, or principle, which puts him 
out of a possibility of sinning. Divines 
have distinguished several kinds of im- 
peccability ; that of God belongs to him 
by nature : that of Jesus Christ, consi- 
dered as man, belongs to him by the 
hypostatical union ; that of the blessed, 
in consequence of their condition, &amp;c. 

IMPLICIT FAITH, is that by which 
we take up any system or opinion of 
another without examination. This has 
been one of the chief sources of igno- 
rance and error in the church of Rome. 
The divines of that community teach, 
" That we are to observe, not how the 
church proves any thing, but what she 
says : that the will of God is, that we 
should believe and confide in his minis- 
ters in the same manner as himself." 
Cardinal Toletus, in his instructions for 

f)riests, asserts, "That if a loistic be- 
ieves his bishop proposing an heretical 
tenet for an article of faith, such belief 
is meritorious." Cardinal Cusanus tells 
us, "That irrational obedience is the 
most consummate and perfect obedi- 
ence, when we obey without attending 
to reason, as a beast obeys his driver." 
In an epistle to the Bohemians he has 
these words : " I assert, that there are 
no precepts of Christ but those which 
are received as such by the church 
(meaning the church of Rome.) When 
the church changes her judgment, God 
changes his judgment likewise." What 
madness ! what blasphemy ! For a 
church to demand belief of what she 
teaches, and a submission to what she 
enjoins, merely upon her assumed au- 
thority, must appear to unprejudiced 
minds the. height of unreasonableness 
and spiritual desyjotism. We could 
wish this doctrine had been confined to 
this church ; but, alas ' it has been too 



IMP 



254 



IMP 



{)revalent in other communities. A theo- 
ogical system, says Dr. Jortin, is too 
often no more than a temple consecra- 
ted to implicit faith ; and he who enter.; 
in there to worship, instead of leaving 
his shoes, after the eastern manner, 
must leave his understanding at the 
door ; and it will be well if he find it 
when he comes out again. 

IMPOSITION OF HANDS, an ec- 
clesiastical action, b)' which a bishop 
lays his hands on the head of a person 
in oi'dination, confirmation, or in uttering 
a blessing. This practice is also fre- 
quently observed by the Dissentei-s at 
the ordination of their preachers ; when 
the ministers present place their hands 
on the head of him whom they are or- 
daining, while one of them prays for a 
blessing on him and on his future la- 
bours. They are not agreed, liowever, 
as to the propriety of this ceremony. 
Some suppose it to be confined to those 
who received extraordinary gifts in the 
primitive times : others think it ought 
to be retained, as it was an ancient 
practice used where no extraordinary 
gifts were conveved. Gen. xlviii. 14. 
Matt. xix. 15. They do not suppose it 
to be of such an important and essential 
nature, that the validity and usefulness 
of a man's future ministry depend upon 
it in any degree. Imposition of hands 
■was a Jewish ceremony, introduced not 
by any divine authority, bat by custom ; 
it being the practice among those peo- 
ple, whenever they prayed to God for 
any person, to lav their hands on his 
head. Our Saviour observed the same 
custom, both when he conferred his 
blessing on childi-en, and when he 
healed the sick, adding prayer to the 
ceremony. The apostles, likewise, laid 
hands on those upon whom they be- 
stowed the Holy Ghost. The priests 
observed the same custom when any 
one was received in tlieir body. And 
the apostles themselves underwent the 
imposition of hands afresh every time 
they entered upon any new design. 
In the ancient church, imposition of 
hands was even practised on persons 
■when they married, which custom the 
. Abyssiniahs still observe. JSTaurice's

IMPOSTORS, RELIGIOUS, are 
such as pretend to an extraordinaiy 
commission from heaven, and who ter- 
rify the people with false denunciations 
of judgments. Too many of these have 
abounded in almost all ages. They are 



punishable in the temporal courts with 
fine, imprisonment, and coi-poreal pun- 
ishment. See False Messiahs. 
• IMPOTENCY, or Impotence, is 
considered as natin'al and moral. J\''a- 
tural is the want of some physical prin- 
ciple necessary to an action, or where a 
being is absolutely defective, or not free 
and at liberty to act. Moral impotency 
imports a great difficulty ; as a strong 
habit to the contrary ; a violent passion ; 
or the like. 

IMPROPRIATION, a parsonage or 
ecclesiastical living, the profits of which 
are in the hands of a layman ; in which 
case its stands distinguished from aiipro- 
priation, which is where the profits of 
a benefice are in the hands of a bishop, 
college, Sec. though the terms are now 
used promiscuously. 

IMPULSE, an influence, idea, or 
motive acting upon the mind. We 
must be careful how we are guided by 
impulses in religion. " There are 
many," as one observes, " who fre- 
quently feel singular impressions upnn 
their minds, and are inclined to pay a 
very strict regard unto them. Yea, 
some caiTy this point so far, as to make 
it almost the only nde of their judg- 
ment, and will not determine any thing, 
until thev find it in their hearts to do it, 
as their phrase is. Others take it for 
granted, that the divine mind is notified 
to them by sweet or powerful impres- 
sions of some passages of sacred writ. 
There are others who are determined 
by visionary manifestations, or by the 
impressions made in dreams, and the 
interpretations they put upon them. 
All these things being of the same 
general nature, may very justly be con- 
sidered together ; and it is a matter of 
doubt with many how far these things 
are to be regarded, or attended to by 
us ; and how we may distinguish any 
divine impressions of this kind from the 
delusions of the tempter, or of our own 
evil hearts. But, whoever makes any 
of these things his rule and standard, 
he forsakes the divine word ; and no- 
thing tends more to make persons un- 
happy in themselves, unsteady in their 
conduct, or more dangerously deluded 
in their practice, than paying a random 
regard to these impulses, as notifica- 
tions of the divine will." See Enthusi- 
asm, Providence. 

IMPURITY, want of that regard to 
decency, chastity, or holiness, which 
our duty requires. Imp&gt;n-ity, in the 
law of Moses, is any legal defilement. 
Of these there were several sorts: 
some were voluntary, as the touching a 
dead body, or any animal that died of it- 



IMP

INA 



self; or any creature that was esteemed 
unclean ; or touching things holy by one 
who was not clean, or was not a priest ; 
the touching one who had a leprosy, 
one who had a gonorrhoea, or who was 
polluted by a dead carcase, &amp;c. Some- 
times these impurities were involunta- 
ry; as when any one inadvertently 
touched bones, or a sepulchre, or any 
thing polluted : or fell into such diseases 
as pollute, as the leprosy, &amp;c. 

The beds, clothes, and moveables 
which had touched any thing unclean, 
contracted also a kind of impurity, and 
in some cases communicated it to others. 

These legal pollutions were general- 
ly removed by bathing, and lasted no 
longer than the evening. The person 
polluted plunged over head in the wa- 
ter; and either had his clothes on 
when he did so, or washed himself and 
his clothes separately. Otlier pollutions 
continued seven days ; as, that which 
was contracted by touching a dead body. 
Some imput-ities lasted forty or fifty 
days; as, that of women who were lately 
delivered, who were unclean forty days 
after the birth of a boy, and fifty after 
the birth of a girl. Others, again,' lasted 
till the person was cured. 

Many of these pollutions were expia- 
ted by sacrifices, and others by a certain 
water or lye made with the ashes of a 
red heifer, sacrificed on tlie great day 
of expiation. When the leper was ' 
cured, he went to the temple, and of- ! 
■ fered a sacrifice of two birds, one of I 
which was killed, and the other set at 
liberty. He who had touched a dead I 
body, or had been present at a funeral, 
was to be purified with the water of ex- 
piation, and this upon pain of death. 
The woman who had been delivered, 
offered a turtle and a lamb for her ex- 
piation ; or if she was poor, two turtles, 
or two young pigeons. 

These impurities, which the law of 
Moses has expressed with the greatest 
accuracy and care, were only figures 
of other more important impurities, 
such as the sins and iniquities commit- 
ted against God, or faults committed 
against our neighbour. The saints and 
prophets of the Old Testament were 
sensible of this ; and our Saviour, in the 
Gospel, has strongly inculcated, — that 
thev are not outward and corporeal 
pollutions which i-ender us unaccepta- 
ble to God, but such inward pollutions 
as infect the soul, and are violations of 
justice, Truth, and charitv. 

IMPUTATION is the attributing 
any matter, quality, or chai-acter, 
whether good or evil, to any person 
as his own. It may refer to what was 



originally his, antecedently to such imr 
putatiop; or to what was not antece- 
dently his, but becomes so by virtue of 
such imputation only, 2 Sam. xix. 19. 
Ps. cvi. 31. The imputation that re- 
spects our justification before God is of 
the latter kind, and may be defined 
thus : it is God's gracious donation of 
the righteousness of Christ to believers, 
and his acceptance of their persons as 
righteous on the account thereof Their 
sins being imputed to him, and his obedi- 
ence being imputed to them, they are, 
in virtue hereof, both acquitted, from 
guilt, and accepted as righteous before 
God, Rom. iv. 6, 7. Rom. v. 18, 19. 2 
Cor. V. 21. See Righteousness, Sin ; 
Dickinson's Letters, p. 156; Heii&lt;ey's 
T/ieron and ylspasio, vol. ii. p. 43 ; 
Doddrii!p-e''s Works, vol. iv. p. 562 ; 
JVatts's IVorks, vol. iii. p. 532. 

INABILITY, want of power suffi- 
cient for the performance of any parti- 
cular action or design. It has been di- 
vided into natural and moral. We are 
said to be naturally unable to do a thing 
when we cannot do it if we wish, be- 
cause of some impeding defect or ob- 
stacle that' is extrinsic to the will, either 
in the understanding, constitution of the 
liod}^, or external objects. Moral ina- 
bility consists not in any of these things, 
but either in the want of inclination, or 
the strength of a contraiy inclination; 
or the want of sufficient motives in view 
to induce and excite the act of the will, 
or the strength of apparent motives to 
the contrary. For the sake of illustra- 
tion, we will here present the reader 
with a few examples of both. 



Moral. 

Cain could not have kill- 
ed Abel, if rain had fear- 
ed God,, and loved his 
brother. 

Potiphar's wife coxdd. 
■not rejoice in it, if she con- 
tinued niid(T it. 

Had that woman been a 
very atfectionate niotlier, 
she coMd not liave kiUed 
her own aon in a time of 
plenty, as she did in a 
time of famine. 

If a dutiful, affection- 
ate son had been waiting 
on Beuhadad in HazaePs 
stead, he cindd not have 
sinotliered him, as Hazael 
did. 

These are a few instances from which 
we may clearly learn the distinction of 
natural and moral inability. It must 
not, however, l)e forgotten, that moral 
inability or disinclination is no excuse 
for our omission of duty, though want of 
natural faculties or necessary means 
would. That God may command. 



JVainral- 

Cain fO!(W not have kill- 
ed Abel, if Cain had been 
the weakest, and Abel 
aware of him. 

J.icob could not rejoice 
in .Joseph's exaltation be- 
fore he heard of it. 

The woman mentioned 
in 2d Kings vi. 29, cojild 
not kill tier neighbour's 
son and eat him, when 
he was hid, and she could 
not find liim. 

Hazael could not have 
smothered Benhadad, if 
he had not been sulTered 
to enter his cliamber.

though man has not a present moral I 
ability to perform, is evident, if we con- 
sider, 1. That man once had a power to 
do whatsoever God would command j 
him, he had a power to oleave to God. j 
— 2. That God did not deprive man of | 
his ability. — 3. Therefore God's right of 
commanding, and man's obligation of 
returning and cleaving to God, remains 
firm. See Libkrty ; and Theol. Misc. 
vol. ii. p. 488; Edwards on the Will; 
Charnock's Works, vol. ii. p. 187 ; 
Watts on Liberty, p. 4. 

INCARNATION, the act whereby 
the Son of God assumed the human na- 
ture ; or the mystery by which Jesus 
Christ, the Eternal Word, was made 
man, in order to accomplish the work 
of our salvation. See Nativity, and 
J\leldrum on the Incarnation. 

INCEST, the crime of criminal and 
unnatural commerce with a person 
•within the degrees forbidden by the 
law. By the rules of the church, incest 
was formerly very absurdly extended 
even to the seventh degree ; but it is 
now restricted to the third or fourth. 
Most nations look on incest with horror, 
Persia and Egypt excepted: In the 
history of the ancient kings of those 
countries we meet with instances of 
brothers marrjing their own sisters, be- 
cause they thought it too mean to join 
in alliance with their own subjects, and 
still more so to marry into any foreign 
family. Vortigem, king of South Bri- 
tain, equalled, or rather excelled them 
in wickedness, by marrying his own 
daughter. The queen of Portugal was 
married to her uncle ; and the prince of 
Brazil, the son of that incestuous mar- 
liage, is wedded to his aunt. But they 
had dispensations for these unnatural 
marriages from his holiness. " In or- 
der," says one, " to preserve chastity 
in families, and between persons of dif- 
ferent sexes brought up and living to- 
gether in a state of unreserved inti- 
macv, it is necessary, by every method 
possible, to incjidcate an abhorrence of 
incestuous conjunctions ; which abhor- 
rence can only be upheld by the abso- 
lute reprobation of all commerce of the 
sexes between near relations. Upon 
this principle the marriage, as well as 
other cohabitation of brothers and sis- 
ters of lineal kindred, and of all who 
usually live in the same family, may be 
said to be forbidden by the law of nature. 
Restrictions which extend to remoter 
degrees of kindred than what this rea- 
son makes it necessary to prohil;it from 
intermarriage, are founded in the au- 
thority of the positive law which or- 
dains them, and can only be justified by 



their tendency to diffuse wealth, to con- 
nect families, or to promote some po- 
litical advantage. 

"The Levitical law, which is re- 
ceived in this country, and from which 
the rule of the Roman law differs veiy 
little, prohibits marriage between rela- 
tions within three degrees of kindred ; 
computing the generations not from, 
but through the common ancestor, and 
accounting affinity the same as consan- 
guinity. The issue, however, of such 
marriages are not bastardized, unless 
the parents be divorced during their 
lifetime." Paley's Mor. Phil. p. 316, 
vol. 1. 

INCEST, SPIRITUAL, an ideal 
crime, committed between two persons 
who have a spiritual alliance, by means 
of baptism or confirmation. This ridicu- 
lous mncv was made use of as an instru- 
ment of great tyi-artny in times when 
the power of the pope was unlimited, 
even queens being sometimes divorced 
upon this pretence. Incest Spii-itual 
is also understood of a vicar, or other 
beneficiary, who enjoys both the mother 
and the daughter; that is, holds two 
benefices, one whereof depends upon 
the collation of the other. Such spiritual 
incest renders both the one and the 
other of these benefices vacant. 

INCLINATION is the disposition or 
jjropensity of the mind to any particular 
object or action : or a kind of bias upon 
nature, by the force of which it is car- 
ried towards certain actions previously 
to the exercise of thought and reasoning 
about the nature and consequences ot 
them. Inclinations are of two kinds, 
natural or acquired. 1. A7itural are 
such as we often see in children, who 
from their eai'liest years differ in their 
tempers and dispositions. In one you 
see the dawnings of a liberal diffusive 
soul ; another gives us cause to fear he 
will be altogether as narrow and sor- 
did. Of one we may say he is naturally 
revengeful ; of another, that he is pa- 
tient and forgiving. — 2. Acquired incli- 
nations are such as are superindu- 
ced by custom, which are called habits ; 
and these are either good or evil. See 

INCOMPREHENSIBILITY OF 
GOD. This is a relative term, aud in- 
dicates a relation between an object and 
a faculty ; between God and a created 
understanding ; so that tlie meaning of 
it is this, that no created understanding 
can comprehend God ; that is, have a 
perfect and exact knowledge of him, 
such a knowledge as is adequate to the 
perfection of the object, Job xi. 7. Is. 
xl. God is incompreherisible, 1. As to

the nature of his essence. 2. The ex- 
cellency of his attributes. 3. The depth 
of his counsels. 4. The works of his 
providence. 5. The dispensation of his 
grace, Eph. iii. 8. Job xxxvii. 25. Rom. 
xi. The incomprehensibility of God 
follows, 1. From his being a spirit endu- 
ed with perfections greatly superior to 
our own. — 2. There may be (for any 
thing we certainly know) attributes and 
perfections in God of which we have 
not the least idea. — 3. In those perfec- 
tions of the divine nature of which we 
have some idea, there are many things 
to us inexplicable, and with which, the 
more deeply and attenti^'ely we think 
of them, the more we find our thoughts 
swallowed up : such as his self-existence, 
eternity, omnipresence, Sec. Tliis siiould 
teach us therefoi-e, 1. To admire and 
reverence the Divine Being, Zech. ix. 
17. Neh. ix. 5. — 2. To be humble and 
modest, Ps. viii. 1, 4. Eccl. v. 2, 3. Job 
xxxvii. 19. — 3. To be serious in our ad- 
dresses, and sincere in our beha^iour

INCONTINENCY, not abstaining 
from unlawful desires. See Continency 
INCORPOREALITY OF GOD, is 
his being without a body. That God is 
incoi-poreal is evident ; for, 1. Materi- 
ality is incompatible with self-existence, 
and God being self-existent, must be in- 
corporeal. — 2. If God were corporeal, 
he could not be present in any part of 
the world where body is ; yet his pi'e- 
sence is necessary for the suppoit and 
motion of body. — 3. A body cannot be in 
two places at the same time ; yet he is 
every where, and fills heaven and earth.

INCORRUPTIBLES,or Incorrup- 
TiBiLEs, the name of a sect which 
sprang out of the Eutychians. Their 
distinguishing tenet was, that the body 
of Jesus Christ was incorruptible ; by 
which they meant, that, after and from 
the time wherein he was formed in the 
Avomb of his mother, he was not suscep- 
tible of any change or alteration ; not 
even of any natural or innocent passion, 
as of hunger, thirst, &amp;c. so that he ate 
Avithout occasion before his death, as 
well as after his resurrection. 

INCREDULITY, the withholding 
our assent to any proposition, notwith- 
standing arguments sufficient to demand 
assent. See Duncan Forbes's piece, en- 



titled, Peflectmis on the Sources of In- 
credulity with regcird to Beligion, and 
Casauhon on Credulity and Incredulity. 
INDEPENDENCY OF GOD is his 
existence in and of himself, without de- 
pending on any other. " His being and 
])erfections," as Dr. Ridgley observes, 
(Body of Div. q. 7.) " are undei'ived, and 
not communicated to him, as all finite 
perfections are by him to the creature. 
This attribute of independency belongs 
to all his perfections. 1. He is indepen- 
dent as to his knowledge. He doth not 
receive ideas from any object out of 
himself, as intelligent creatures do. 
This is elegantly described by the pro- 
phet, Is^ xl. 13, 14. — 2. He is indepen- 
dent in power. Ashe receives strength 
from no one, so he doth not act depen- 
dently on the will of the creature. Job 
xxxvi. 23. — 3. He is independent as to 
his holiness, hating sin necessarily, and 
not barely depending on some reasons 
out of himself inducing him thereto ; 
for it is essential to the divine natui-e to 
be infinitely opposite to sin, and there- 
fore to be independently holy. — 4. He 
is independent as to his bounty and 
goodness. He communicates blessings 
not by constraint, but according to his 
sovereign will. Thus he gave being 
to the world, and all things therein, 
which was the first instance of bounty 
and goodness; and this not by constraint, 
but by his free will ; ' for his pleasure 
they are and were created.' In like 
manner, whatever instances of mercy 
he extends to m.iserable creatures, he. 
acts independently, and not by force. 
He shows mercy, because it is his 
pleasure to do so, Rom. ix. 18. That 
God is independent, let it farther be 
considered, 1. That all things depend 
on his power which brought them into 
and preserves them in being. If, there- 
fore, all things depend on God, then it 
Avould be absurdity to say that God 
depends on any thing, for this would be 
to suppose the cause and the effect to 
be mutually dependent on and derived 
from each other, which infers a contra- 
diction. — 2. If God be infinitely above 
the highest creatures, he cannot de- 
pend on any of them, for dependence 
argues inferiority-, Is. xl. 15. 17. — 3. If 
God depend on any creature, he does 
not exist necessarily ; and if so, then 
he might not have been : for the same 
will by which he is supposed to exist, 
might have determined that he shonld 
not have existed, which is altogether 
inconsistent with the idea of a God. 
From God's being independent, we in- 
fer, 1. That we ought to conclude that 
the creature cannot lay any obligation

on him, or do any thing th U may tend 
to make him more happy tlian he is in 
himself, Rom. xi. 35. Job xxii. 2, 3. — 2. 
If independency be a divine perfection, 
then let it not in any instance, or by any 
consequence, be attributed to the crea- 
tui'e ; let us conclude that all our springs 
are in him : and that all we enjoy and 
hope for is from him, who is the author 
and finisher of our faith, and the foun- 
tain of all ovir blessedness." 

INDEPENDENTS, a sect of Pro- 
testants, so called from their maintain- 
ing that each congregation of Christians 
which meet in one house for public wor- 
ship is a complete church ; has sufficient 
power to act and perform evej-y thing 
relating to religious govei'nment within 
itself; and is in no respect subject or 
accountable to other churches. 

Though the Episcopalians contend 
that there is not a shadow of the hide- 
pendent discipline to be found either in 
the Bible or the primitive church, the 
Independents, on the contrary, believe 
that it is most clearly to be deduced 
from the practice of the apostles in plant- 
ing the first churches. See Church 
Congregational, and Episcopacy. 
The Independents, however, were not 
distinguished as a bodv till the time 
of queen Elizabeth. The hierarchy 
established by that princess in the 
churches of her dommions, the vest- 
ments worn by the clergy- in the cele- 
bration of divine worship, the book of 
Common Prayer, and, above all, the 
sign of the cross used in the administra- 
tion of baptism, were very offensive to 
many of her subjects, who, during the 
persecutions of the former reign, had 
taken I'efuge among the Protestants of 
Ciermany and Geneva. These men 
thought that the church of England re- 
sembled in too many particulars the 
anti-christian church of Rome : they 
therefore called perpetually for a more 
thorough reformation, and z. purer wor- 
ship. From this circumstance they 
were stigmatized Avith the general name 
of Puritaiis, as the followers of Nova- 
tian had been in the ancient church. 
See No V ATI AN s. Elizabeth was not 
disposed to comply with their demands; 
and it is difficult to say wliat might 
have been the issue of the contest, had 
the Puritans been united among them- 
selves, in sentiments, views, and mea- 
sures. But the case was quite other- 
wise ; that large body, composed of 
persons of different ranks, characters, 
opinions, and intentions, and imanimous 
in nothing but their antipathy to the es- 
tablished church, was all of a sudden di- 
vided Into a variety of sects. Of these, 



the most famous was that which was 
formed about the year 1581, by Robert 
Brown, a man insinuating in his man- 
ners, but unsteady and inconsistent in 
his views and notions of men and things. 
Brown was for dividing the whole body 
of the faithful into separate societies 
or congregations ; and maintained that 
such a number of persons as could be 
contained in an ordinary place of woi'- 
ship ought to be considered as a church, 
and enjoy all the rights and privileges 
that are competent to an ecclesiastical 
"community. These small societies he 
pronounced bidcfiendent, jure divino, 
and entirely exempt from the jurisdic- 
tion of the bishop, in whose hands the 
court had placed the reins of a spiritual 
government ; and also from that of 
presbyters and synods, which the Puri- 
tans regarded as the supreme visible 
sources of ecclesiastical authority. But 
as we have given an account of the 
general opinions and discipline of the 
Brownists, we need not enumerate them 
here, but must beg the reader to refer 
to that article. The zeal with which 
Brown and his associates maintained 
and propagated his notions, was, in a 
high degree, intemperate and extrava- 
gant. He affirmed that all communion 
was to be broken off" with those I'eligious 
societies that were founded upon a dif- 
ferent plan from his ; and treated more 
especially the church of England as a 
spurious church, whose ministers were 
unlawfully ordained ; whose discipline 
was popish and anti-christian; and 
whose sacraments and institutions were 
destitute of all efficacy and virtue His 
followers not being able to endure the 
sevei'e treatment which thc*y met with 
from an administration that was not 
distinguished for its mildness and indul- 
gence, retired into the Netherhmds, and 
ibunded churches at Middlebourg, Am- 
sterdam, and Leyden. Their founder, 
however, returned into England, re- 
nounced his principles of separation, 
and took orders m the established 
church. The Puritan exiles, whom he 
thus abandoned, disagreed among them- 
selves, were split into parties, and their 
affairs declined from day to day. This 
engaged the wiser part of them to 
mitigate the severity of their founder's 
plan, and to soften the rigour of his un- 
charitable decisions. 

The person who had the chief merit 
of bringing about this reformation was 
one of their pastors, of tlie name of Ro- 
binson; a man who had much of the 
solemn piety of the times, and no incon- 
sidei'able portion of learning. This 
well-meaning reformer, perceiving the 



IND 



259 



IND 



defects that reigned in the disciphne of 
Brown, and in the spirit and temper of 
his followers, emplojed his zeal and 
diligence in correctnig them, and in 
new-modelling the society in such a 
manner, as to render it less odious to his 
adversaries, and less liable to the just 
censure of those true Christians who 
look upon charity as the end of the 
commandments. Hitherto the sect had 
been called Brownists; but Robinson 
having in his apology affirmed that all 
Christian congregations wei'e so many 
indefiendent religious societies, that had 
a right to be governed by their own 
laws, indefiendent of any farther or fo- 
reign jurisdiction, the sect was hence- 
forth called Indefie7idents, of which the 
apologist Avas considered as the founder. 
The first Independent or congrega- 
tional church in England was establish- 
ed bv a Mr. Jacob, in the year 1616. 
Mr. Jacob, Avho had fled from the per- 
secution of bishop Bancroft, going to 
Holland, and havnig imparted his de- 
sign of gettingjttp a separate congrega- 
tion, like thos^Tn Holland, to the most 
learned Puritans of those times, it was 
not condemned as unlawfid, considering 
there was no prospect of a national re- 
formation. Mr. Jacob, therefore, hav- 
ing* summoned se\"eral of his friends 
together, and having obtained their con- 
sent to unite m church fellowship for 
enjoying the ordinances of Christ in the 
purest manner, they laid the foundation 
of the first independent church in Eng- 
land in the following way. Having ob- 
served a dav of solemn fasting and 
prayer for a blessing upon their under- 
taking, towards the close of the solem- 
nity, each of tliem made an open con- 
fession of their faith in Christ; and then, 
standing together, they joined hands, 
and solemnly covenanted with each 
other, in the presence of Almighty God, 
to walk together in all God's ways and 
oi'dinances, according as he had already 
revealed, or should farther make known 
to them. Mr. Jacob was then chosen 
pastor by the suffrage of the brother- 
nood; and others were appointed to 
the office of deacons, with fasting and 
prayer, and imposition of hands. 

The Independents were much more 
• commendable than the Brownists; they 
surpassed them, both in the moderation 
of their sentiments, and in the order of 
their discipline. They did not, like 
Brown, pour forth bitter and uncharita- 
ble invectives against the churches 
which were governed by rules entirely 
different from theirs, nor pronounce 
them, on that account, unworthy of the 
Christian name. On the contrary, 



though they considered their own fonn 
of ecclesiastical government as of divine 
institution, and as originally introduced 
by the authority of the apostles, nay^ 
by the apostles themselves, they had 
yet candour and charity enough to ac- 
knowledge, that true religion and solid 
piety might flourish in those communi- 
ties which were under the jurisdiction 
of bishops, or the government of synods 
and presbyteries. They were also much 
more attentive than the Brownists in 
keeping on foot a regular ministry in 
their communities ; for, while the latter 
allowed promiscuously all ranks and 
orders of^ men to teach in public, the 
Independents had, and still have, a cer- 
tain number of ministers, chosen re- 
spectively by the congregations where 
they are fixed ; nor is it common for any 
person among them to speak in public 
befoi-e he has submitted to a proper ex- 
amination of his capacity and talents, 
and been approved of by the heads of 
the congregation. 

From 1642, the Independents are 
very frequently mentioned in the Eng- 
lish annals. The charge alleged against 
them by Rapin (in his history of Eng- 
land, vol. ii. p. 514. folio ed.) that they 
could not so much as endure ordinary 
ministers in the church, &amp;c. is ground- 
less. He was led into this mistake by 
confounding the Independents with the 
Brownists. Other charges, no less un- 
justifiable, have been urged against the 
Independents by this celebrated histo- 
rian, and others. Rapin says, that they 
abhorred monarchy, and approved of a 
I'epublican government: this might have 
been true with regard to many persons 
among them, in common with other 
sects ; but it does not appear, from any 
of their public writings, that republican 
principles formed their distinguishing 
characteristic ; on the contrary, in a 
public memorial drawn up by them in 
1647, tliey declare, that they do not dis- 
approve of any fonn of civil govern- 
ment, but do freely acknowledge that a 
kingly government, bounded by just and 
wholesome laws, is allowed by God, and 
also a good accommodation unto men* 
The Independents, however, have been 
generally ranked among the regicides, 
and charged with tlie death of Charles I. 
Whether this fact be admitted or de- 
nied, no conclusion can be fairly drawn 
from the greater prevalence of repub- 
lican principles, or from violent pro- 
ceedings at that period, that can anect 
the distinguishing tenets and conduct of 
the Independents in our times. It is 
certain that the present Independentff 
, are steady friends to a limited moaar-

chy. Rapin is farther mistaken when 
he rem-esents the religious principles 
of the English Independents as contraiT 
to those of all the rest of the world. _ It 
appears from two confessions of faith, 
one composed by Rol)inson in behalf of 
the English Independents in Holland, 
and published at Leyden in 1619, enti- 
tled&gt; .apologia pro Exulibus Anglis, 
qui BrowniHtx viilgo apjiellantur ; and 
another drawn up in London in 1658, by 
the principal members of this commu- 
nity in England, entitled, " A Declara- 
tion ■ of the Faith and Order owned and 
practised by theCongi-egationalChurch- 
es in England, agreed upon and con- 
sented unto by then- Elders and Messen- 
gers, in their meeting at the Savoy, Oct. 
i2th, 1658," as well as from other writ- 
ings of the Independents, that they dif- 
fered from the rest of the reformed in 
no single point of any consequence, ex- 
cept that of ecclesiastical government ; 
and their religious doctrines were al- 
most entirely tlie same v/ith those adopt- 
ed by the church of Geneva. During 
the administration of Cromwell, the In- 
dependents acquired very considerable 
reputation and influence ; and he made 
use of them as a check to the ambition 
of the Presbyterians, who aimed at a 
very high degree of ecclesiastical pov/- 
er, and who had succeeded, soon after 
the ele\'ation of Cromwell, in obtaining 
a parliamentary establishment of their 
own church government. But after 
the restoration, their cause declined ; 
and in 1691 they entered into an asso- 
ciation with the Presbyterians residing 
in and about London, comprised in nine 
articles, that tended to the maintenance 
of their respective institutions. These 
may be found in the second volume of 
Whiston's Memoirs, and the substance 
of them in Mosheim. At this time the 
Independents and Presbyterians, called 
from this association the United Breth- 
ren^ were agreed with legard to doc- 
trines, being generally Calvinists, and 
differed only with respect to ecclesias- 
tical discipline. But at present, though 
the English Independents and Presby- 
terians form two distinct parties of 
f*i-otestant Dissenters, they are dis- 
tinguished by veiy trifling diflfei-ences 
Avith regard to church government, and 
the denominations are more arbitrarily 
\jsed to comprehend those who differ in 
theological opinions. The Independents 
are generally more attached to Calvin- 
ism than the Presbyterians. Indepen- 
dentism is peculiar to Great Britain, 
the United States, and the Batavian Re- 
public. It was carried first to the Ame- 
rican colonies in 1620, and by successive 



Puritan emigrants, in 1629 and 163S, 
from England. One Morel, in the six- 
teenth century, endeavoured to intro- 
duce it into France; but it was con- 
demned at the synod of Rochelle, where 
Beza presided ; and again at the synod 
of Rochelle, in 1644. 

Many of the Independents reject the 
use of all creeds and confessions drawn 
up by fallible men, though they require 
of their teachers a declaration of their 
belief in the Gospel and its various doc- 
trines, and their adherence to the Scrip- 
tures as the sole standard of faith and 
practice. They attribute no virtue 
whatever to the rite of ordination, upon 
which some other churches lay so much 
stress. According to them, the quali- 
fications which constitute a regular 
minister of the New Testament are, 
a firm belief in the Gospel, a principle 
of sincere and unaffected piety, a com- 
petent stock of knowledge, a capacity 
for leading devotion and communicating 
instruction, a serious inclination to en- 
gage in the important Employment of 
promoting the everlasting salvation of 
mankind, and ordinarily an invitation 
to the pastoral office from some par- 
ticular society of Christians. Where 
these things concur, they consider a per- 
son as fitted and authorised for the dis- 
charge of every duty which belongs to 
the ministerial function ; and they be- 
lieve that the imposition of hands of 
bishops or presbyters would convey to 
him no powers or prerogatives of which 
he was not before possessed. But though 
they attribute no virtue to ordination, 
as conveying any new powers, yet they 
hold with and practise it. Many of 
them, indeed, suppose that the essence 
of ordination does not lie in the act of 
the ministers who assist, but in the 
choice and call of the people, and the 
candidate's acceptance of that call ; so 
that their ordination may be considered 
only as a public declaration of that 
agreement. See Ordination. They 
consider it as their right to choose their 
own ministei s and deacons. They o\yn 
no man as head of the church. They 
disallow of parochial and provincial 
subordination ; but though they do not 
think it necessary to assemble synods, 
yet, if any be held, they look upon their 
resolutions as prudential counsels, but 
not as decisions to which they are 
obliged to conform. They consider the 
Scri])tures as the only criterion of truth. 
Their worship is conducted in a decent, 
plain, and simple manner, without the 
ostentation of form and the vain pomp 
of ceremony.

dents are very numerous, both in Eng- 
land and America, and some of them 
very respectable. This denomination 
has produced many characters as emi- 
nent for learning and piety as any 
church in Christendom ; whose works, 
no doubt, will reflect lasting honour on 
their characters and abilities. See 
Church Congregational; Noncon- 
formists, and books under those ar- 
ticles 

INDEX, EXPURGATORY, a cata- 
logue of prohibited books in the church 
of Rome. The first catalogues of this 
kind were made by the inquisitors, and 
these were afterwards appro\'ed of by 
the council of Trent, after some alter- 
ation was made in them by way of re- 
trenchment or addition. Thus an in- 
dex of heretical books being formed, 
it was confirmed by a bull of Clement 
VIII. in 1595, and printed with several 
introductory niles ; by the fourth of 
which, the use of the Scriptures in the 
vulgar tongue is forbidden to all pes-- 
sons without a particular licence: and 
by the tenth rule it is ordained, that no 
book sliall be printed at Rome without 
the approbation of the pope's vicar, or 
some person delegated by the pope : 
nor in any other places, unless allowed 
by the bishop oi the diocese, or some 
person deputed by him, or by the inqui- 
sitor of heretical pravity. The Trent 
index being thus published, Philip II. 
of Spain ordered another to be pnnted 
at Antwerp in 1571, with considerable 
enlargements. Another index was pub- 
lished in Spain in 1584, a copy of which 
Avas snatched out of the fii-e when the 
English plundered Cadiz. Afterwards 
there were several expurgatory indexes 
printed at Rome and Naples, and par- 
ticularly in Spain. 

INDIGNATION, a strong disappro- 
bation of mind, excited by something 
flagitious in the conduct of another. It 
does not, as Mr. Cogan observes, al- 
Avays suppose that excess of depravity 
which alone is capable of committing 
deeds of horror. Indignation always re- 
fers to culpability of conduct, and can- 
not, like the passion of horror, be ex- 
tended to distress ^ther of body or 
mind. It is produced by acts of trea- 
chery, abuse of confidence, base ingra- 
titude, &amp;c. which we cannot contem- 
plate without being provoked to anger, 
and feeling a generous resentment. 

INDULGENCES, in the Romish 
chui-ch, are a remission of the punisli- 
ment due to sin, granted by the church, 
and supposed to save the sinner from 
purgatory. 

According to the doctrine of the Ro- 



mish church, all the good works of the 
saints, over and above those which 
were necessary towards their own jus- 
tification, are deposited, together with 
the infinite merits of Jesqs Christ, in 
one inexliaustible treasury. The keys 
of this were committed to St. Peter, 
and to his successors, the popes, who 
maj' open it at ])leasure ; and, by trans- 
ferring a portion of this superabundant 
merit to any particvdar person for a 
sum of money, may comej^ to him 
either the pardon of his own sins, or a 
release foi- any one in whom he is inter- 
ested from the pains of purgatoiy. Such 
indulgences were first invented in the 
eleventh century, by Urban II. as a re- 
compence for those who went in per- 
son upon the glorious enterprise of con- 
quering the Holy Land. They were 
afterwards granted to those who hired 
a soldier for that purpose ; and in pro- 
cess of time were bestowed on such as 
gave money for accomplishing anypi- 
ous work enjoined by the pope. The 
power of granting indulgences has been 
greatly abused in the church of Rome. 
Pope Leo X., in order to carry on the 
magnificent structure of St. Peter's, at 
Rome, published indulgences, and a 
plenary remission to all such as should 
contribute money towards it. Finding, 
the project take, he granted to Albert, 
elector of Mentz, and archbishop of 
Magdeburg, the benefit of the indul- 
gences of Saxony, and the neighbouring 
parts, and farmed out those of other 
countries to the highest bidders : who, 
to make the best of the bargain, pro- 
cured the ablest preachers to cry up 
the value of the ware. The form of 
these indulgences was as follows : — 
"May our Lord Jesus Christ have 
mercy upon thee, and absolve thee by 
tlie merits of his most holy passion. 
And I, by his authority, that of his 
blessed apostles, Peter and Paul, and of 
the most holy pope, granted and com- 
mitted to me in these parts, do absolve 
thee, first from all ecclesiastical cen- 
sures, in whatever manner they have 
been incurred ; then from all thy sins, 
transgressions, and excesses, how enor- 
mous soever they may be : even from 
such as are reserved for the cogni- 
zance of the holy see, and as far as the 
keys of the holy church extend. I re- 
mit to you all punishment wliich you 
deserve in purgatory on their account : 
and I restore you to the holy sacra- 
ments of the church, to the unity of the 
faithfiil, and to that innocence and puri- 
ty which you possessed at baptism : so 
that when you die, the gates of punish- 
ment shall be shut, and the gates of the 



IND 



262 



INF 



paradise of delight shall be opened ; and 
II you shall not die at present, this 
grace shall remain in full force when 
you are at the point of death. In the 
name of the Father, the Son, and the 
Holy Ghost." According to a book, 
called the Tax of the sacred Roman 
Chancery, in which are contained the 
exact sums to be levied for the pardon 
of each particular sin, we find some of 
the fees to be thus : 

s. d. 

For procuring abortion 7 6 

For simony 10 6 

1" or sacrilege 10 6 

For taking a false oath in a crimi- 
nal case 9 

For robbing 12 

For burning a neighbour's house . 12 

For defiling a virgin 9 

For lying with a mother, sister, &amp;c. 7 6 

For murdering a layman 7 6 

For keeping a concubine 10 6 

For laying violent hands on a cler- 
gyman 10 6 

And so on. 

The terms in which the retailers of 
indulgences described their benefits, and 
the necessity of purchasing them, were 
so extravagant that they appear almost 
incredible. If any man, said they, pur- 
ch^e letters of indulgence, his soul may 
i-est secure with respect to its salvation. 
The souls confined in purgatory, for 
whose redemption indulgences arc pur- 
chased, as soon as the money tinkles in 
the chest, instantly escape fi-om that 
place of torment, and ascend into hea- 
ven. That the efficacy of indulgences 
was so great, that the most heinous sins, 
even if one should violate (which was 
impossible) the Mother of God, would 
be remitted and expiated by them, and 
the person be freed both from ])unish- 
ment and guilt. That this was the un- 
speakable gift of God, in order to recon- 
cile man to himself. That the cross 
erected by the preachers of indulgences 
was equally efficacious with the cross 
of Christ itself." " Lo," said they, "the 
heavens are open : if you enter not now, 
when will you enter .&gt; For twelve pence 
you may redeem the soul of your father 
out of purgatory ; and are you so un- 
grateful that you will not rescue the 
soul of your parent from torment? If 
you had but one coat, you ought to strip 
yourself instantly, and sell it, in order 
to purchase such benefit," &amp;:c. It was 
this great abuse of indulgences that 
contributed not a little to the reform- 
ation of religion in Germany, where 
Martin Luther began first to declaim 
against the preachers of indulgences, 
and afterwards against indulgences 



themselves. Since that time the popes 
have been more sparing in the exercise 
of this power ; although it is said, they 
still cany on a great trade with them to 
the Indies, where they are purchased at 
two rials a piece, ana sometimes more. 
We are told also that a gentleman not 
long since being at Naples, in order that 
he might be fully ascertained respecting 
indulgences, went to the office, and foV 
two sequins purchased a plenary remis- 
sion of all sms for himself and any two 
other persons of his friends or relations, 
whose names he was empowered to in-

serts the doctrine of Christ's consisting 
of two beings; one the self-existent 
Creator, and the other a creature made 
into one person by an ineffable union and 
indwelling, which renders the same at- 
tributes and honours equally applicable 
to both. See Pre-existence. Dr.

I&gt;f FALLIBILITY, the quality of not 
being able to be deceived or mistaken. 

The infallibility of the church of Rome 
has been one of the great controversies 
between the Protestants and Papists. 
By this infallibility it is understood, 
that she cannot at any time cease to be 
orthodox in her doctrine, or fall into 
any pernicious errors ; but that she is 
constituted, by divine authority, the 
judge of all controversies of religion, 
and that all Christians are obliged to 
acquiesce in her decisions. This is the 
chain which keeps its members fast 
bound to its communion ; the charm 
which retains them within its magic 
circle ; the opiate which lays asleep all 
their doubts and difficulties : it is. like- 
wise the magnet which attracts the de- 
sultory and unstable in other persua- 
sions within the sphere of popery, the 
foundation of its whole superstructure, 
tlie cement of all its parts, and its fence 
and fortress against all inroads and 
attacks. 



INF 



263 



INF 



Under the idea of this infallibility, 
the church of Rome claims, 1. To de- 
termine what books are and what are 
not canonical, and to oblige all Chris- 
tians to receive or reject them accord- 
ingly. — 2. To communicate authority to 
the Scripture ; or, in other words, that 
the Scriptm'e (quoad nos,) as to us, re- 
ceives its authority from her. — 3. To 
assign and fix the sense of Scripture, 
which all Christians are submissively 
to receive. — 4. To decree as necessary 
to salvation whatever she judges so, 
although not contained in Scripture. — 
5. To decide all controversies respect- 
ing matters of faith. These are the 
claims to which the church of Rome 
pretends, but which we shall not here 
attempt to refute, because any man 
with the Bible in his hand, and a little 
common sense, will easily see that they 
are all founded upon ignorance, super- 
stition, and error. It is not a little re- 
markable, however, that the Roman 
Catholics themselves are much divided 
as to the seat of this infallibility, and 
which, indeed, may be considered as a 
satisfactory proof that no such privi- 
lege exists in the church. For is it con- 
sistent with reason to think that God 
would have imparted so extraordinary 
a gift to prevent errors and dissensions 
in the church, and yet have left an ad- 
ditional cause of error and dissension, 
viz. the' unceitaint)' of the place of its 
abode? No, surely. — Some place this 
infallibility in the pope or bishop of 
Rome ; some in a general council ; 
others in neither pope nor council sepa- 
rately, but in both conjointly ; whilst 
others are said to place it in the church 
diffusive, or in all churches throughout 
the world. But that it could not be de- 
posited in the pope is evident, for manv 
popes have been heretics, and on that 
account censured and deposed, and 
therefore could not have been infallible. 
That it could not be placed in a general 
council is as evident ; for general coun- 
cils have actually erred. Neither could 
it be placed in the pope and council 
conjointly; for two fallibles could not 
niake one infallible any more than two 
ciphers could make an integei-. To say 
that it is lodged in the church univer- 
sal or diffusive, is equally as erroneous ; 
for this would be useless and insignifi- 
cant, because it could never l)e exer- 
cised. The whole church could not 
meet to make decrees, or to choose 
representatives, or to deliver their sen- 
timents on any question started ; and, 
less than all would not be the whole 
church, and so could not claim that 
privilege. 



The most general opinion, however, 
it is said, is that of its being seated in a 
pope and general Touncil. The advo- 
cates for this opinion consider the pc)pe 
as the vicar of Christ, head of the 
church, and centre of unity ; and there- 
fore conclude tliat his concuiTence with 
and approbation of the decrees of a 
general council are necessary, and suffi- 
cient to afford it an indispensable sanc- 
tion and plenary authority. A general 
council they regard as the church repre- 
sentative, and suppose that nothing can 
be wanting to ascertain the truth of any 
controversial point, when the pretended 
head of the church and its members, as- 
sembled in their supposed representa- 
tives, mutually concur and coincide in 
judicial definitions and decrees, but that 
mfallibility attends their coalition and 
conjunction in all their determinations. 
. Every impartial person, who consi- 
ders this subject with the least degree 
of attention, must clearly perceive that 
neither any individual nor body of 
Christians ha^e any ground from trea- 
son or Scripture for pretending to infal- 
libility. It is evidently the attribute of 
the Supreme Being alone, which we 
have all the foundation imaginable to 
conclude he has not communicated to 
any mortal, or associations of mortals. 
The human being who challenges infal- 
libility seems to imitate the pride and 
presumption of Lucifer, when he said, — 
1 will ascend, and will be like the Most 
High. A claim to it was unheard of in 
the primitive and purest ages of the 
church ; but became, after that period, 
the arrogant pretension of papal ambi- 
tion. History plainly informs us, that 
the bishops of Rome, on the declension 
of the Avestern Roman empire, began to 
put in their claim of being the supreme 
and infallible heads of the Christiai^ 
church ; which they at length establish- 
ed by their deep policy and unremitting 
efforts ; by the concurrence of fortunate 
circumstances; by the advantages which 
they reaped from' the necessities of some 
princes, and the superstition of others ; 
and by the general and excessive cre- 
dulity of the people. However, when 
they had grossly abused this absurd 
pretension, and committed various acts 
of injustice, tyranny, and cruelty ; when 
the blind veneration for the papal dig- 
nity had been greatly diminished by the 
long and scandalous schism occasioned 
by contending popes ; when these had 
been for a considerable time roaming 
about Europe, fawning on princes, 
squeezing their adherents, and cursing 
their rivals ; and when the councils of 
Constance and Basil had challenged anH

exercised the ris^ht of deposing andelect- 
inu; the bishops of Rome, then their pre- 
tensions to nifallibility Avcre called in 
question, and the world discovered that 
councils wei-e a jurisdiction superior to 
that of the towering pontiffs. Then it 
was that this infallibility avus transferred 
by many divines from popes to general 
councils, and the opinion of the sujjerior 
authority of a council above that of a 
pope spread vastly, especially under 
the profligate pontificate of Alexander 
VI. and the martial one of Julius II. 
7^he popes were thought by numbers 
to be too unworthy possessors of so nch 
a jewel ; at the same time it appeared 
to be of too great a value, and of too 
extensive consequence, to be parted 
with entirely. It was, therefore, by the 
major part of the Roman church, de- 
posited with, or made the property of 
general councils, either solely or con- 
jointly with the pope. See Si?j!t/i^s Er- 
rors of the Church of Rome detected ; 
and a list of writers under article 
Popery. 

INFANT COMMUNION, the ad- 
mission of infants to the ordin;ince of 
the Lord's supper. It has been debated 
by some, whether or no infants should 
be admitted to this ordinance. One 
of the greatest advocates for this prac- 
tice was Mr. Pierce. He pleads the 
use of it even unto this day among the 
Greeks, and in the Bohemian churches 
till near the time of the reformation ; 
but especially from the custom of the 
ancient churches, as it appears from 
many passages in Photius, Augustin, 
and Cyprian. But Dr. Doddridge ob- 
serves, that Mr. Pierce's proof from 
the more ancient fatliers is very defec- 
tive. His arguments from Scripture 
chiefly depend upon this general me- 
dium ; that Christians succeeding to the 
Jews as God's people, and being graft- 
ed upon that stock, their infants have 
a I'ight to all the privileges of which 
they are capable, till forfeited by some 
immoralities: and consequently have 
a right to partake of this ordinance, as 
the Jewish children had to eat of the 
passover and other sacrifices; besides 
this, he pleads those texts which speak 
of the Lord's supper as received by all 
Christians. 

The most obvious answer to all this, 
is that which is taken from the incapa- 
city of infants to examine themselves, 
and discern the Lord's body ; but he 
answers that this precept is only given 
to persons capable of understanding and 
complving with it, as those whicli re- 
quire faith in order to baptism are in- 
teipreted by the Pxdo-baptists. As for 



jl his argument from the Jewish childrdrt 
' eating the sacrifice, it is to be consider- 
' ed that this was not required as circum- 
1 cision was ; the males were not neces- 
|i sarily brought to the temple till they 
Ij were twelve years old, Luke ii. 42. and 
the sacrifices they ate of were chiefly 
'j fieace-Oj^rringSfWhich became the com- 
;;mon food to all that were clean in the 
family, and were not looked upon as 
acts of devotion to such a degree as our 
eucharist is ; though, indeed, they were 
a token of their acknowledging the di- 
vinity of that God to Avhom they had 
been offered, 1 Cor. x. 18. and even the 
passover was a commemoration of a 
temporal deliverance ; nor is there any 
reason to believe that its reference to 
the Messiah was generally understood 
by the Jews. 

On the whole, it is certain there 
would be more danger of a contempt 
ai-ising to the Lord's supper fi-om the 
admission of infants, and of confusion 
and trouble to other communicants ; to 
that not being required in Scripture, it 
is much the best to omit it. When 
children are grown up to a capacity 
of behaving decently, they may soon be 
instructed in the nature and design of 
the ordinance ; and if they appear to 
understand it, and behave for some 
competent time of trial in a manner 
suitable to that profession, it would 
probably be advisable to admit them to 
communion, though very young; which, 
by the way, might be a good security 
against many of the snares to which 
youth are exposed. Doddridge's Lec-

INFANTS, salvation of. "Various 
opinions," says an acute writer, " con- 
cerning the future state of infants have 
been adopted. Some think, all dying in 
infancy are annihilated ; for, say they, 
infants, being incapable of moral good 
or evil, are not proper objects of re- 
ward or punishment. Others think 
that they share a fate similar to adults ; 
a part saved, and a part perish. Others 
affirm all are saved because all are im- 
mortal and all are innocent. Others, 
perplexed with these diverse senti- 
ments, think better to leave the subject 
untouched. Cold comfort to parents 
who bury tl;fir families in infancy ! The 
most probable opinion seems to be, that 
they are all saved, through the merits 
of the Mediator, with an everlasting

salvation. This has nothing in it con- 
trary to the perfections of God, or to 
any declaration of the Holy Scriptures ; 
and it is highly agreeable to all those 
passages which affirm where sin hath 
abounded, grace hath much more 
abounded. On these principles, the 
deatli of Christ saves moi-e than the fall 
of Adam lost." If. the reader be desi- 
rous of examining 'the subject, we re- 
fer him to p. 415, vol. ii. Robiyison's

INFIDEJ.ITY, want of faith in God, 
or the disbelief of the truths of revela- 
tion, and the great principles of reli- 
gion. If we enquire into the rise of infi- 
delity, we shall find it does not take its 
origin from the result of sober enqtiiry, 
close investigation, or full conviction ; 
but it is rather, as one observes, "The 
slow production of a careless and irre- 
ligious life, operating together with pre- 
judices and erroneous conceptions con- 
cerning the natui'e of the leading doc- 
trines of Christianity. It may, there- 
fore, be laid down as an axiom, that 
injidelity is, in general, a disease of the 
heart more than of the understanding ; 
for we always find that infidelity m- 
creases in proportion as the general 
morals decline. If we consider the na- 
ture and effect of this principle, xve 
shall find that it subverts the whole 
foundation of morals; it tends directly 
to the destruction of a taste for moral 
excellence, and promotes the growth of 
those vices which are the most hostile 
to social happiness, especially vanity, 
ferocity, and unbridled sensuality. As 
to the firogress of it, it is certain that, 
of late years, it has made rapid strides. 
Lord Herbert did not, indeed, so much 
impugn the doctrine or the morality of 
the Scriptures, as attem])t to supersede 
their necessity, bv endeavouring to show 
that the great principles of the unity of 
God, a moral government, and a future 
■world, are taught with sufficient clear- 
ness l)y the light of nature. Bolingbroke, 
and others of his successors, advanced 
much farther, and attempted to invali- 
date the proofs of the moral character 
of the Deity, and consequently all ex- 

f)ectation of rewards and punishments, 
eaving the Supreme Being no other 
perfections than those which belong to 
a first cause, or Almighty contriver. 
After him, at a considerable distance, 



followed Hvime, the most subtle of all, 
who boldly aimed to introduce an uni- 
versal scepticism, and to pour a more 
than Egyptian darkness into the whole 
region of morals. Since his time, scep- 
tical wi'iters have sprung iip in abuii- 
dance, and infidelity has allured multi- 
tudes to its standard ; the young and 
supei-ficial, by its dexterous sophistiy ; 
the vain, by the literary fame of its 
champion ; and the profligate, by the 
licentiousness of its prmciples." But let 
us askj What will be its end? Is there 
any thing in the genius of this principle 
that will lead us to suppose it will reigu 
triumphant ? So far fi'om it, we have 
reason to believe that it will be banished 
from the earth. Its inconsistency with 
reason ; its incongruity with the nature 
of man ; its cloudy and obscure pi'os- 
pects ; its unsatisfying nature ; its op- 
position to the dictates of conscience ; 
Its pernicious tendency to eradicate 
every just principle from the breast of 
man, and to lead the way for every spe- 
cies of vice and immorality, show us 
that it cannot floin-ish, but must finally 
fall. And, as Mr. Hall justly observes, 
" \'\''e ha\e nothing to fear ; for, to an 
attentive observer of the signs of the 
times, it will appear one of the most ex- 
ti-aordinary phenomena of this eventful 
crisis, that, amidst the ravages of athe- 
ism and infidelity, real religion is on the 
mcrease ; for while infidelity is marking 
its progress liy devastation and ruin, by 
the prostration of thrones and concus- 
sion of kingdoms, thus appalling the in- 
habitants of the world, and compelling 
them to take refuge in the church of 
God, the true sanctuary ; the stream of 
divine knowledge, unobserved, is flow- 
ing in new^ channels ; winding its course 
among humble valleys, refreshing thirsty 
deserts, and enriching, with far other 
and higher blessings than those of com- 
merce, the most distant climes and na- 
tions ; until, agreeably to the prediction 
of prophecy, the knowledge of the Lord 
shall fill and cover the whole earth." 
See Hall's admirable Sermon on Inji' 
delity ; Fuller's Gospel of Christ its 
own Witness; Bishoh Watson's Afio- 
logy for the Bible ; Wilhe7-force's Prac- 
tical Vieiv, § 3. ch. 7 ; Bfi. Home's Let-

INFIRMITY, applied to the mind, 
denotes frailty, weakness. It has been 
a question what may properly be deno- 
minated sins of infirmity. 

1. Nothing, it is said, can be excused 

under that name which at the time of 

its commission is known to be a sin, — ^2, 

Nothing can be called a sin of infirmity 

Li

ING 



which is contrary to tlie express letter 
of ail)' of the commandments. — 3. No- 
thing will admit of a just and sufficient 
excuse upon the account of infirmity 
which a man beforehand considers and 
deliberates -with himself, whether- it be 
,a sin or no. A sin of infirmity is, 1. 
Such a failing as proceeds from excusa- 
ble ignorance. — 2. Or imavoidable sur- 
prise. — 3. Or want of courage and 
strength, Rom. xv. 1. 

By infirmity also we understand the 
corruptions that are still left in the heart 
(notwithstanding a person may be sanc- 
tified in part,) and which sometimes 
break out. These may be permitted to 
humble us ; to animate our vigilance ; 
perhaps that newly convinced sinners 
might not be discouraged by a sight of 
such perfection they might despair of 
ever attaining to ; to keep us prayerful 
and dependent; to prevent those ho- 
nours which some would be ready to 
give to human nature rather than to 
God ; and, lastly, to excite in us a con- 
tinual desire for heaven. Let us be cau- 
tious and watchful, however, against sin 
in all its forms : for it argues a deplora- 
ble state of mind when men love to prac- 
tise sin, and then lay it upon constitu- 
tion, the infirmity of nature, the decree 
of God, the influence of Satan, and thus 
attempt to excuse themselves by say- 
ing they could not a\'oid it. Clarke's 
Senn. ser. 12, vol_. ix. Alassiloii's Serm. 
vol. ii.p. 213, Eiig. trans. 

INFINITY, infinity is taken in two 
senses entirely different, i. e. in a posi- 
tive and a negative one. Positive infi- 
nity is a quality of being perfect in itself, 
or capable of receiving no addition. ^'^- 
gative is the quality of being boundless, 
unlimited, or endless. That God is in- 
finite is evident ; for as Doddridge ob- 
serves, 1. If he be limited, it must either 
be by himself, or by another; but no 
•wise being would abridge himself, and 
there could be no other being to limit 
God. — 2. Infinity follows from Self-ex- 
istence ; for a necessity that is not uni- 
versal must depend on some external 
cause, which a self-existent Being does 
not. — 3. Creation is so great an act of 
power, that we can imagine nothing im- 
possible to that Being who has perform- 
ed it, but must therefore ascribe to him 
infinite power. — 4. It is more honoura- 
ble to the Divine Being to conceive of 
him as infinite, than finite. — 5. The 
Scriptures i*epresent all his attributes as 
infinite. His understanding is infinite, 
Psal. cxlvii. 5. His knowledge and wis- 
dom, Rom. xi. 33. His power, Rom. i. 
20. Heb. xi. 3. His goodness, Psal. xvi. 
2. His purity, holiness, and justice. Job 



iv. 17, 18. Isa. vi. 2, 3. — 6. His omnijio- 
tence and eternity prove his infinity ; 
for were he not infinite, he would be 
bounded by space and by time, which 
he is not. Doddridge'' s Lect. lee. 49 ; 
IVatts's Ontology, cli. 17 ; Locke on Un- 
dcrst. vol. i. cli. 17 ; Howe's Works, vol. 
i. p. 63, 64. 67. 

INFLUENCES, DIVINE, a term 
made use of to denrtte the operations of 
the Divine Being upon the mind. This 
doctrine of divine influences has been 
much called in question of late ; but we 
may ask, 1. What doctrine can be more 
reasonable ? '.' The operations which 
the power of God carries on in the 
natural world are no less mysterious 
than those which the Spirit performs 
in the moral world. If men, by their 
councils and suggestions, z%\\ inttuence 
the minds of one another, must not di- 
vine suggestion produce a much greater 
effect ? Surely the Father of spirits, by 
a thousand ways, has access to the spi- 
rits he has made, so as to give them 
what determination, or impart to them 
what assistance he thinks proper, with- 
out injuring their frame or disturbing 
their rational powers." 

We may observe, 2. Nothing can be 
more scjifitural. Eminent men from 
the patriarchal age down to St. John, 
the latest writer, believed in this doc- 
trine, and ascribed their religious feel- 
ings to this source. Our Lord strongly 
and repeatedly inculcated this tnith ; 
and that he did not mean miraculous, 
but moral influences of the Spirit, is evi- 
dent, John iii. 3. Matt. vii. 22, 23. John 
vi. 44, 46. See also, John xii. 32, 40. 
Rom. viii. 9. 1 Cor. ii. 14. — 3. And we 
may add, nothing can be more necessary, 
if we consider the natural depravity of 
the heart, and the insufficiency of all 
human means to render ourselves either 
holy or happy without a supernatural 
power. See VVilliams's Historic Defence 
of Exfierimental Religion; Williams's 
Answer to Bels/iam, let. 13; Hurrion's 
Sermons on the Spirit; Owen on the 
Spirit. 

INGHAMITES ; a denomination of 
Calvinistic dissenters, who are the fol- 
lowers of B. Ingham, esq. who in the 
last century was a character of great 
note in the north of England. About the 
year 1735, Mr. Ingham was at Queen's 
college with Mr. Hervey and other 
friends, but soon afterwards adopted the 
religious opinions and zeal of vVesley 
and Whitfield. We do not know the 
cause of his separation ft-om these emi- 
nent men; but it seems in a few years 
afterwards he became the leader of 
many numerous societies, distinct from 



INJ

the methodists. They received their 
members bv lot, and required them to 
declare before the church their ex/te- 
rience, that the whole society miglit 
judge of the gracious change which had 
been wrought upon their hearts. It 
happened in a few years, that some in- 
dividuals, who were much respected, 
and who applied for admission, mstead 
of speaking of their own attainments, or 
the comfortable impressions on tlieir 
minds, which they only considered as 
pi'oductive of strife and vain glory, de- 
clared their only hope was the finished 
work of Jesus Christ, and as to them- 
selves thev were sensible of their own 
vileness. Such confessions as this threw 
the congi'egation into some confusion, 
which was considerably increased when 
they found, that, on their having re- 
course as usual to the lot, that there 
were votes against their admission, 
which was considered as a rejection 
from the Lord. On this they were led 
to examine more particularly both their 
chuixh order and doctrines. After this 
time, Mr. Ingham became much more 
orthodox in his sentiments, and new- 
modelled his churches. The book which 
he published is in general well thought 
of by the Independents. He contends 
very strongly for salvation by the impu- 
tation of Christ's righteousness ; and as 
to doctrine, the chief point wherein the 
Inghamites differ froiii the Indepen- 
dents, is respecting the Trinity. The 
common manner of speaking of the Di- 
vine Three as distinct persons, they de- 
cisively condemn. They do not consider 
a plurality of elders as necessary in a 
church to administer the Lord's Sup- 
per. In other respects they much es- 
teem the writings of Mr. R. Sandeman. 
Their numbers have not been so nume- 
rous since they became more strict in 
their public worship. 

INGRATITUDE, the vice of being 
insensible to favours received, without 
any endeavour to acknowledge and re- 
pay them. It is sometimes applied to 
the act of returning evil for good. In- 
gratitude, it is said, is no passion : for 
the God of nature has appointed no 
motion of the spirits whereby it might 
be excited ^ it is, therefore, a mere vice, 
arising from pride, stupidity, or nar- 
rowness of soul. 

INIQUITY. See Sin. 

INJURY, a violation of the rights of 
another. Some, says Grove, distinguish 
between mjiiatitia and injuria. Injus- 
tice is opposed to justice in general, 
whether negative or positive ; an injury 
to negative justice alone. See Justice. 
An injury, is wilfully doing to another 



what ought not to be done. This is in- 
justice, too, but nf&gt;t the whole idea of 
it ; for it is injustice, also to refuse or 
neglect doing what ought to be done. 
An injury must be wilfully committed ; 
whereas it is enough to make a thing 
unjust, that it happens through a culpa- 
ble negligence. 1. IVe rnaij injiLre a per- 
son in his soul, by misleading his judg- 
ment ; by corrupting the imagination ; 
perverting the will ; and wounding the 
soul with grief. Persecutors who suc- 
ceed in their compulsive measures, 
though they cannot alter the real senti- 
ments by external violence, yet some- 
times injure the soul by making the man 
a hypocrite.^2. JVe may injure ano- 
ther in his body, by homicide, murder, 
preventing life, dismembering the body 
by wounds, blows, slavery, and impi-i- 
sonment, or any unjust I'estraint upon 
its liberty ; by robbing it of its chastity, 
or prejudicing its health. — 3. We may 
injure another in his na7ne and charac- 
ter, by our own false and rash judg- 
ments of him ; by false witness ; by 
charging a man to his face with a crime 
which either we ourselves have forged, 
or which we know to have been forged 
by some other person ; by detraction or 
backbiting ; by reproach, or exposing 
another for some natural imbecility ei- 
ther in body or mind ; or for some ca- 
lamity into which he is fallen, or some 
miscarriage of which he has been guilty ; 
bv inuendos, or indirect accusations that 
are not true. Now if we consider the 
value of character, the resentment which 
the injurious person has of such treat- 
ment when it comes to his own turn to 
suffer it, the consequence of a man's 
losing his good name, and finally, the 
difficulty of making reparation, we 
must at once see the injustice of lessen- 
ing another's good character. There 
are these two considerations which 
should sometimes restrain us from 
speaking the whole truth of our neigh- 
bour, when it is to his disadvantage, 
(1.) That he may possibly live to see his 
tolly, and repent and grow better. — (2.) 
Admitting that we speak tlie truth, yet 
it is a thousand to one but, when it is 
handed about for some time, it will con- 
tract a deal of falsehood. — 4. ]Ve may 
injjire a person in his relatio?is and de- 
pendencies. In his ser\-ants, by corrupt- 
ing them ; in his children, by drawuig 
them into evil courses ; in his wife, by 
sowing strife, attempting to alienate her 
affections. — 5. ll^e may be !^uilty of in- 
juring another in his worldly ffoods or 
possessions. 1. By doing him a mis- 
chief, without any advantage to our- 
selves, through envy and malice. — 2. By

INQUISITION, in the church of 
Rome, a tribunal, in several Roman ca- 
tholic countries, erected by the popes 
for the examination and punishment of 
hei-etics. This court was founded in the 
twelfth century, under the patronage of 
pope Innocent, who issued out orders 
to excite the catholic princes and peo- 
ple to extirpate heretics, to search into 
their number and quality, and to trans- 
iriit a faithful account thereof to Rome. 
Hence they were called inquisitors, and 
gave birth to this formidable tribunal, 
called the Inquisition. That nothing 
might lie wanting to render this spiritual 
court formidable and tremendous, the 
Roman pontiff's persuaded tlie Euro- 
pean princes, and more especially the 
emperor Frederick II. and Lewis IX. 
king of France, not only to enact tlie 
most barbarous laws against heretics, 
and to commit to the flames, by the mi- 
nistry of public justice," those who were 
pronounced such by the inquisitors, but 
also to maintain the inquisitors in their 
office, and grant them their protection 
in the most open and solemn manner. 
The edicts to this purpose issued out by 
Frederick II. are well known ; edicts 
sufficient to have excited the greatest 
horror, and which rendered tlie most il- 
lustrious piety and virtue incapable of 
saving from the cruellest dcatli such as 
had the misfortune to be disagreeable to 
the inquisitors. These abominable laws 
were not, however, sufficient to restrain 
the just indignation of the people against 
those inhuman judges, whose barbaritv 
was accompanied with superstition and 
arrogance, with a spirit of suspicion and 
perfidy ; nay, even with temerity and 
imprudence. Accordingly, thev were 
insulted bythe multitude in many places, 
were dri\'en in an ignominious manner 
out of some cities, and were put to death 
in others; and Conrad, of Mai-purg, 
the first German inquisitor who dei-ived 
his commission from Gregorv IX. was 
one of the many victims that were sa- 
crificed on this occasion to the ven- 
geance of the public, which his incredi- 
ble barbarities had raised to a dreadful 
de.jree of veh'-mence and fury. 

This diabolical tribunal takes cogni- 



zance of heresy, Judaism, Mahometan- 
ism, sodomy, and polygamy ; and the 
people stand in so much fear of it, that 
parents deliver up their children, hus- 
bands their wives, and masters their 
ser\'ants, to its officers, without daring 
in the least -to murmur. The prisoners 
are kept for a long time, till they them- 
selves turn their own accusers, and de- 
clare the cause of their imprisonment, 
for which they are neither told their 
crime, nor confronted with witnesses. 
As soon as they are imprisoned, their 
friends go into mourning, and speak of 
them as dead, not daiing to solicit their 
pardon, lest they should be brought in 
as accomplices. When there is no sha- 
dow of proof against the pretended cri- 
minal, he is discharged, after suffering 
the most cruel tortures, a tedious and 
dreadful imprisonment, and the loss of 
the greatest part of his effects. The 
sentence against prisoners is pronounced 
publicly, and with extraordinary so- 
lemnity. In Portugal they erect a 
theatre capal)le of holding three thou- 
sand persons, in which they place a rich 
altar, and raise seats on each side, in 
the form of an amphitheatre. There the 
prisoners are placed, and over against 
them is a high chair, whither they are 
called one by one to hear their doom 
from one of the inquisitors. These un- 
hapi")y persons know what they are to 
suffer by the clothes they wear that 
dav : those who appear in their own 
clothes are discharged on paying a fine ; 
those who have a santo benko, or strait 
yellow coat without sleeves, charged 
with St. Andrew's cross, have their 
lives, but forfeit all their effects ; those 
who have the resemblance of flames 
made of red serge sewed upon their 
santo benito, without any cross, are par- 
doned, but threatened to be burnt if 
ever they relapse ; but those who, be- 
sides those flames, have on their santo 
benito their " own picture surrounded 
with devils, are condemned to expire in 
the flames. The inquisitors, who are 
ecclesiastics, do not pronounce the sen- 
tence of death, but form and read an 
act, in which they say, that the crimi- 
nal, being convicted of such a crime, by 
his own confession, is with much re- 
luctance, delivered to the secular power, 
to be punished according to his de- 
merits : and this writing they give to 
the seven judges, who attend at the right 
side of the altar, and immediately pass 
sentence. ■ For the conclusion of this 
horrid scene, see Act of Faith. We 
rejoice however, to hear, that in many 
Roman Catholic countries, the inquisi- 
tion is now shut. May the God of mer-

INSPIRATION, the conveying of 
certain extraordinary and supernatm'al 
notions or motions into the soul ; or it 
denotes any supernatural influence of 
God upon the mind of a rational crea- 
ture, whereby he is foi-med to any de- 
gi'ee of intellectual improvement, to 
which he could not, or would not, in 
fact, have attained in his present cir- 
cumstances in a natural way. Thus the 
prophets are said to have spoken by di- 
vine inspiration. 1. An inspiration of 
superintendency , in which God does so 
influence and direct the mind of any 
person as to keep him more secure 
from error in some various and com- 
plex discourse, tlian he would have been 
merely by the use of his natural facul- 
ties. — 2. Plenary sufierintendent inspi- 
ration, which excludes any mixture of 
error at all from the performance so su- 
perintended. — 3. Inspiration of eleva- 
tion, where the faculties act in a regu- 
lar, and, as it seems, in a comnion man- 
ner, yet are raised to an extraordinary 
degree, so that the composure shall, 
upon the whole, have more of the true 
sublime or pathetic tlian natural genius 
could have given. — 4. Inspiration of 
suggestion, where the use of the facul- 
ties is superseded, and God does, as it 
were, speak directly to the mind, ma- 
king such discoveries to it as it could 
not otherwise have obtained, and dicta- 
ting the very words in which such dis- 
covei'ies are to be communicated, if 
they are designed as a message to 
others. It is generally allowed that the 
Scriptures were written by divine in- 
spiration. The matter of them, the spi- 
rituality and elevation of their design, 
the majesty and simplicity of their style, 
the agreement of their various parts ; 
their wonderful eflicacy on mankind; 
the candour, disinterestedness, and up- 
rightness of the penmen ; their asto- 
nishing presentation ; the multitude of 
miracles wrought in confirmation of the 
doctrines they contain, and the exact 
fulfilment of their predictions, prove 
this. It has been disputed, however, 
whether this inspiration is in the most 
absolute sense, plenary. As this is a 
subject of importance, and ought to be 
carefully studied by every Christian, in 
order that he may render a reason of 
the hope that is in him, I shall here sub- 
join the remarks of an able writer, who, 



though he may differ from some others 
as to the terms made use of abo^•e, yet 
I am persuaded his arguments will be 
found weighty and powerful. " There 
are many things in the Scriptures," 
says Mr. Dick, "which the winters 
might have known, and pvobablv did 
know, by ordinary means. As persons 
possessed of memory, judgment, and 
other intellectual faculties, which are 
common to men, they were able to re- 
late certain events in which they had 
been personally concerned, and to make 
such occasional reflections as were sug- 
gested by particular subjects and oc- 
currences. In these cases no superna- 
tural influence was necessary to in\'igo- 
rate their minds ; it was only necessary 
that they should be infallibly preserved 
from error. It is with respect to such 
passages of Scripture alone, as did not 
exceed the natural ability of the writers 
to compose, that I would admit the no- 
tion of superintendence, if it should be 
admitted at all. Perhaps this word, 
though of established use and almost un- 
disputed authority, should be entirely 
laid aside, as insufficient to express even 
the lowest degree of inspiration. In the 
passages of Scripture which we are now 
considering, I conceive the writers to 
have been not merely superintended, 
that they might commit no error, but 
likewise to have been moved or excited 
by the Holy Ghost to record particular 
events, and set down particular obser- 
vations. The passages written in con- 
sequence of tlie direction and under the 
care of the Divine Spirit, may be said, 
in an inferior sense, to be inspired ; 
whereas if the men had written them 
at the suggestion of their own spirit, 
they would not have possessed any 
more authority though they had been 
free from error, than those parts of 
profane writings which are agreeable 
to truth. 

2. "There are other parts of the 
Scriptures in which the faculties of the 
writers were supernaturally invigora- 
ted and elevated. It is impossible for 
us, and perhaps it was not possible for 
the inspired person himself, to deter- 
mine where nature ended and inspira- 
tion began. ' It is enough to know, that 
there are many parts of Scripture in 
which, though the unassisted mind 
might have proceeded some steps, a 
divine impulse was necessary to enable 
it to advance. I think, for ex.imple, that 
the evangelists could not have writ- 
ten the history of Christ if tliey had 
not enjoved miraculous aid. 'I'wo of 
them, iVlatthew and John, accompanied 
our Saviour during the space oi three

years and a half. At the close of this 
period, or rather several years after it, 
■when they wrote their Gospels, we may 
be certain that they had forgotten many 
of his discoui'ses and mii-acles; that they 
recollected others indistinctly ; and that 
they would have been in danc^-er of pro- 
ducing an inaccurate and unfair accoimt, 
by confounding one thing with another. 
Besides, from so large a mass of par- 
ticulars, men of uncultivated minds, 
who were not in the habit of distin- 
guishing and classifying, could not have 
made a proper selection ; nor would 
persons unskilled in the art of compo- 
sition have been able to express them- 
selves in such terms as should insure a 
faitliful representation of doctrines and 
facts, and with such dignity as the na- 
tui-e of the subject required. A divine 
influence, therefore, must have been 
exerted on their minds, by which their 
memories and judgments were strength- 
ened, and they were enabled to relate 
the doctrines and miracles of their Mas- 
ter in a manner the best fitted to im- 
press the readers of their histories. The 
promise of tlie Holy Ghost to bring to 
their remembrance' all things whatso- 
ever Christ had said to them, proves, 
that, in writing their histories, their 
mental powers were endowed, by his 
agency, with more than usual vigour. 

'• Farther; it must be allowed that in 
several passages of Scri])ture tlicre is 
found such elevation of tliought and of 
stvle, as clearly shows tliat the powers 
of the writei^s were raised above their 
ordinary pitch. If a i)erson of moderate 
talents should give as elevated a descrip- 
tion of the majesty and attrilxites of 
God, or reason as profoundly on the mys- 
terious doctrines of religion, as a man 
of the most exalted genius and exten- 
sive learning, Ave could not fail to be 
convinced that he was snpernaturally 
assisted ; and the conviction wo\dd be 
still stronger, if his composition should 
far ti-anscend the highest efforts of the 
human mind. Some of the sacred wri- 
ters were taken from the lowest ranks 
of lite ; and yet sentiments so dignified, 
and representations of divine things so 
grand and majestic, occur in their wri- 
tings, that the noblest flights of human 
genius, when compared with them, ap- 
pear cold and insipid. 

3. "It is manifest, with respect to 
many passages of Scripture, that the 
suDJects of which they treat must have 
been directly revealed to the writers. 
They could not have been known by 
any natural means, nor was the know- 
ledge of them attainable by a simple 
elevation of the faculties. With the 



faculties of an angel we could not dis- 
cover the purposes of the divine mind. 
This degi'ee of inspiration we attribute 
to those who were empowei-ed to reveal 
heavenly mysteries, 'which eye had not 
seen, and ear had not heard,' to those 
who were sent with particular messages 
from God to his ])eople, and to those 
who Avere employed to predict future 
events. The plan of redemption being 
an effect of the sovereign councils of 
heaven, it could not have been knoAvn 
but by a communication from the Fa- 
ther of Lights. 

"This kind of inspiration has been 
called the inspiration of suggestion. It 
is needless to dispute about a word; 
but suggestion seeming to express an 
operation on the mind, by Avhich ideas 
are excited in it, is of too limited signi- 
fication to denote the various modes in 
Avhich the prophets and apostles were 
made acquainted Avith' supernatural 
truths. God revealed himself to them 
not only by suggestion, but by dreams, 
visions, voices, and tlie ministry of an- 
gels. This degree of inspiration, m strict 
propriety of speech should be called 
revelation ; a Avord preferable to sug- 
gestion, because it is expressive of all 
the Avays in Avhich God communicated 
ncAv ideas to the minds of his servants. 
It is a Avord, too, chosen by the Holy 
Cihost himself, to signify the discoveiy 
of truths formerly unknoAvn to the apos- 
tles. The last book of the Ncav Testa- 
ment, Avhich is a collection of prophe- 
cies, is called the Beve/ation of Jesus 
Christ. Paul says, that he received the 
Gospel by revelation ; tliat ' by revela- 
tion the "mystery was made known to 
him, Avhich in other ages Avas not made 
knoAvn unto the sons of men, as it was 
then revealed unto his holy apostles and 
prophets by the Spirit :' and in another 
place, having observed that 'eye had 
not seen, nor ear heard, neither had en- 
tered into the heart of man the things 
Avhich God had prepared for them that 
love him,' he adds, " But God hath re- 
vealed them unto us by his Spirit," Rev. 
i. 1. Gal. i. 12. Eph. ii. 5. 1 Cor. ii. 
9, 10. 

"I haA-e not names to designate the^ 
other two kinds of inspiration. The 
names used Ijy Doddridge, and others," 
Superintendence, Elevation, and Sug- 
gestion, do not convey the ideas stated 
in the three preceding particulars, and 
are liable to other olijections, besides 
those which have been mentioned. This 
account of the inspiration of the Scrip- 
tures has, I think, these two recom- 
mendations : that there is no part of 
Scripture which does not fall under one 



INS

or other of the foregoing heads; and 
that the different degrees of the agency 
of -the Divine Spirit on the minds of the 
different writers are carefully diiicrimi- 
nated. • 

" Some men have adopted very 
strange and dangerous notions respect- 
ing the inspiration of the Scriptures. 
Di". Priestley denies that they were 
written by a particular divine inspira- 
tion ; and asserts that the writers, though 
men of the greatest probity, were falli- 
ble, and have actually committed mis- 
takes in their narrations and their rea- 
sonmgs. But this man and his follow- 
ers find it their interest to weaken and 
set aside the authority of the Scriptures, 
as they have adopted a system of reli- 
gion from which all the distinguishing 
doctrines of revelation are excluded. 
Others consider the Scriptures as in- 
spii-ed in those places where they pro- 
fess to deliver the word of God ; but in 
other places, especially in the historical 
parts, they ascribe to them only the 
same authority which is due to the 
writings of well informed and uprigb.t 
men. But as this distinction is perfectly 
arbitrary, having no foundation in any 
thing said by the sacred writers them- 
selves, so it is liable to very material 
objections. It represents our Lord and 
his apostles, when they speak of the Old 
Testament, as having attested, without 
any exception or limitation, a number of 
books as divinely inspired, while some 
of them were paitly, and some were 
almost entirely, human compositions : it 
supposes the writers of both Testaments 
to have profanely mixed their own pro- 
ductions with the dictates of the Spirit, 
and to have passed the unhallowed com- 

Eound on the world as genuine. In fact, 
y denying that they were constantly 
under infallible guidance, it leaves us 
utterly at a loss to know when we should 
or should not believe them. If they 
could blend their own stories with the 
revelations made to them, how can I be 
certain that they have not, on some oc- 
casions, published, in the name of God, 
sentiments of their own, to which they 
were desirous to gain credit and au- 
thority ? Who will assure me of their 
perfect fidelity in drawing a line of dis- 
tinction between the divine and the hu- 
man parts of their writings ? The de- 
nial of the plenary inspiration of the 
Scripture tends to' unsettle the founda- 
tions of our faith, involves us in doubt 
and perplexity, and leaves us no other 
method of ascertaining how much we 
should believe, but by an appeal to rea- 
son. But when reason is invested with 
the authority of a judge, not only is re- 



velation dishonoured and its author in- 
sulted, but the end for which it was 
given is completely defeated. 

" A question of very great importance 
demands our attention, while we are en- 
deavouring to settle, with pi'ecision, the 
notion of the inspiration of the Scrip- 
tures : it relates ''o the words in which 
the sacred writers ha.ve expressed their 
ideas. Some think, that in the choice of 
words they were left to their own dis- 
ci-etion, and that the lar^guage is human, 
though the matter be divine;' while 
others believe, that in their expressions, 
as well as in their sentiments, they were 
under the infallible direction of the 
Spirit. It is the last opinion which ap- 
pears to be most conformable to truth, 
and it may be supported by the follow- 
ing reasoning. 

"Every man who hath attended to 
the operations of his own mind, knows 
that we think in words, or that, when 
we form a train or combination of ideas, 
we clothe tliem with words ; and that 
the ideas which are not thus clothed, 
are indistinct and confused. Let a man 
try to think upon any subject, moral or 
religious, without the aid of language, 
and he will either experience a total 
cessation of thought, or, as this seems 
impossible, at least while we are awake, 
he will feel himself constrained, not- 
withstanding his utmost endeavours, to 
have recourse to words as the instru- 
ment of his mental operations. As a 
great part of the- Scriptures was sug- 
gested or revealed' to the writers ; as 
the thoughts or sentiments, which were 
perfectly new to them, were conveyed 
into their minds by the Spirit, it is plain 
that they must have been accompanied 
with words proper to express them ; 
and, consequently, that the words were 
dictated by the same influences on the 
mind which communicated the ideas. 
The ideas could not have come without 
the words, because without them they 
could not have been conceived. A no- 
tion of the form and qualities of a ma- 
terial object may be produced by sub- 
jecting it to our senses ; but there is no 
conceivable method of making us ac- 
quainted with new abstract truths, or 
with things which do not lie within the 
sphere of sensation, but by conveyingto 
the mind, in some way or other, the 
words significant of them. — In all those 
passages of Scripture, therefore, which 
were written by revelation, it is mani- 
fest that the words were inspired ; and 
this is still more evident with respect to 
those passages which the writers them- 
selves did not understand. No man 
II could write an intelligi!&gt;le discourse on 



INS 



272 



INS 



a subject which he does not understand, ' 
unless he were furnished with the words 
as well as the sentiments ; and that the I 
penmen of the Scriptures did not al- l 
ways understand what they wrote, i 
mivrht be safely inferred from the com- 
parative darkness of the dispensation 
under which some of them lived ; and J 
is intimated by Peter, when he says, j 
that the prophets 'enquired and search- ! 
ed diligently what, and what manner of : 
time the Spirit of Christ which was in ' 
them did signify, when it testified be- ' 
forehand the sufferings of Chi*ist, and 
the glory that should follow.' 1 Pet. i. 
10, 11. { 

" In other passages of Scripture, 
those not excepted in which the writers 
relate such things as had fallen within '• 
the compass of their own knowledge, 
we shall be disposed to believe that 
the words are inspired, if we calmly ' 
and seriously weigh the following con- | 
siderations. If Christ promised to his | 
disciples, that, when they were brought 
before kings and governors for his sake, 
'it should be given them in that same 
hour what they should speak, and that 
the Spirit of the Father should speak in 
them.' Matt. X. 19,20. Luke xii. 11, 12. 
a promise which cannot be reasonably 
understood to signify less than that both 
words and sentiments should be dictated 
to them, it is fully as credible that they 
should be assisted in the same manner 
when they wrote, especially as the re- 
cord was to last through all ages, and 
to be a rule of faith to all the nations of 
the earth. Paul affirms that he and the 
other apostles spoke ' not in the words 
which man's wisdom teacheth, but 
which the Holy Ghost taught,' 1 Cor. 
ii. 13. and this general assertion may be 
applied to their writings as well as to 
their sermons. Besides, every person 
who hath reflected upon the subject, is 
aware of the importance of a proper se- 
lection of words in expressing our senti- 
ments ; and knows how easy it is for a 
heedless or unskilful person not only to 
injure the beauty and weaken the effi- 
cacy of a discourse by the impropriety 
of his language, but by substituting one 
word for another, to which it seems to 
be equivalent, to alter the meaning, and 
perhaps render it totally different. If, 
then, the saci'ed writers had not been 
directed in the choice of words, how 
Gould we have been assuT-ed that those 
which they have chosen were the most 
proper.'' Is it not possible, nay, is it not 
certain, that they would ha\'e some- 
times expressed themselves inaccurate- 
ly, as many of them were illiterate; and 
by consequence would have obscured 



and misrepresented the truth? In this 
case, how could fmr faith have securely 
rested on their testimony ? Would not 
the suspicion of error in their writings 
have rendered it necessary, before we 
received them, to try them by the stan- 
dard of reason i' and would not the au- 
thority and the design of revelation have 
thus been overthrown ? We must con- 
clude, therefore, that the words of 
Scripture are from God, as well as the 
matter : or we shall charge him with a 
want of wisdom in transmitting his 
truths through a channel by which they 
might have been, and most probably 
have been, polluted. 

" To the inspiration of the words, the 
difference in the style of the sacred 
writers seems to be an objection ; be- 
cause, if the Holy Ghost were the au- 
thor of the words, the style might be 
expected to be uniformly the same. 
But in answer to this objection it may be 
observed, that the Divine Spirit, whose 
operations are various, might act differ- 
ently on different persons,^ according to 
the natural turn of their minds. He 
might enable one man, for instance, to 
write more sublimely than another, 
because he was naturally of a more ex- 
alted genius than the other, and the ■ 
subject assigned to him demanded more 
elevated language ; or he might pro- 
duce a difference in the style of the 
same man, by raising, at one time, his 
faculties abo\'e their ordinaiy state ; and 
by leaving them at another, to act ac- 
cording to their native energy under his 
inspection and control, We should not 
suppose that inspiration, even in its 
higher degrees, deprived those who 
were the subjects ot it, of the use of 
their faculties. They were, indeed, the 
organs of the Spirit ; but they were 
conscious, intelligent organs. They 
were dependent, but distinct agents; 
and the operation of their mental 
powers, though elevated and directed 
by superior influence, was analogous to 
their ordinary mode of procedure. It 
is easv, therefore, to conceive that the 
style of the writers of the Scriptures 
should differ, just as it would have dif- 
fered if they had not been inspired. A 
perfect uniformity of style could not 
have taken place, unless they had all 
been inspired in the same degree, and 
by inspiration their faculties had been 
completely suspended, so that divine 
truths were con\'eyed by them in the 
same passive manner in which a pipe 
affords a passage to water, or a trumpet 
to the breath." See Dicf:'s Essay on

A'iew of the beneficial consequences, 
but merely from a strong impulse sup- 
posed necessary in its elrects, and to be

commanded them. — 2. Moral are those, 
the reasons of which we see, and the 
duties of which arise out of the nature 
of the case itself, prior to external com- 
mand. — 3. Human, are generally appli- 
ed to those inventions of men, or means 
of honouring God, which are not ap- 
pointed by him, and which are nume- 
rous in the church of Rome, and too 
many of them in Protestant churches. —

INTEGRITY, purity of mind, free

sagacity, founded upon knov/ledge of 
the world, is the best conductor of every 
one who would be a successful adven- 
turer in life, and that a strict attention 
to integrity would lead them into dan- 
p;er and distress. But, in answer to this 
it is justly observed, 1. That the guid- 
ance of integrity is the safest under 
which we can be placed ; that the road 
in which it leads us is, upon the whole, 
the freest from, dangers, Prov. iii. 21, 
&amp;c. — 2. It is unquestionably the most 
honourable ; for nitegrity is "the founda- 
tion of all that is high in character 
among mankind, Prov. iv. 8. — 3. It is 
the most conducive to felicity, Phil. iv.

can look forward to eternity without 
dismay, Rom. ii. 7. 

INTEMPERANCE, excess in eat- 



ing or drinking. This is the general 
idea of it; but we may observe, that 
whatever indulgence undermines the 
health, impairs the senses, inflames the 
passions, clouds and sullies the reason, 
perverts the judgment, enslaves the will, 
or in any way disorders or debilitates 
the faculties, may be ranked under this 
vice. See article Temperance. 

INTERCESSION OF CHRIST, his 
interposing for sinners by viitue of the 
satislaction he made to divine justice. 1. 
As to the fact itself, it is evident, from 
many places of Scripture, that Christ 
pleads with God in favour of his peo- 
ple, Rom. viii. 34. Heb. \'ii. 25. 1 John 
ii. 1. — 2. As to the manner of it : the 
appearance of the high -priest among the 
Jews, in the presence of God, on the day 
of atonement, when he offered before 
him the blood of the sin-ofFering, is at 
large referred to by St. Paul, as illus- 
trating the intercession of Christ, Heb. 
ix. 11, 14, 22, 26. Heb. X. 19, 21. Christ 
appears before God with his own bodv; 
but whether he intercedes vocally or not, 
cannot be known : though it is most pro- 
bable, I think, that he does not : how- 
e^-er, it is certain that he does' not intei- 
cede in like manner as when on earth, 
with prostration of body, cries and tears, 
which would be qviite inconsistent with 
his state of exaltation and glorv ; nor as 
supplicating an angry judge, for peace 
is made by the blood of the cross ; nor 
as litigating a point in a court of judica- 
ture ; but his intercession is carried on 
b)^ showing himself as having done, as 
their surety, all that law and justice 
coidd I'equire, by representing his blood 
and sacrifice as the ground of his peo- 
ple's acceptance with the Father, Rev. 
V. 6. John xvii. 24. — 3. The end of 
Christ's intercession is not to remind 
the Divine Being of any thing which he 
would otherv.'ise forget, nor to persuade 
him to any thing which he is not dis- 
posed to do ; but it may serve to illus- 
trate the holiness and majesty of the 
Father, and the wisdom and grace of 
the Son ; not to say that it may have 
other unknown uses with respect to the 
inhabitants of the invisible world. He 
is^ represented, also, as offering up the 

Erayers and praises of his people, which 
ecome acceptaljle to God through him. 
Rev. viii. 3, 4. Heb. xiii. 15. 1 Pet. ii. 5. 
He there pleads for the conversion of 
his unconvei'ted ones ; and for the con- 
solation, preservation, and glorification 
of his people, John xvii. 1 John ii. 1, 2.

cessioji we may observe, 1. That it is

INTERDICT, an ecclesiastical cen- 
sure, by wliich the churcli of Rome for- 
bids tlie performance of divine service 
in a kingdom, ])rovince, town, &amp;.c. This 
censure has been frequently executed in 
France, Italy, and Germany ; and in 
tlie year 1170, Pope Alexander III. put 
all England imder an interdict, forbid- 
ding* the clergy to perform any part of 
divine service, except baptizing nifants, 
taking confessions, and giving absolution 
to dying penitents ; but this censure 
being liable to ill consequences, of pro- 
moting libertinism and a neglect ot re- 
ligion, the succeeding popes have very 
seldom made use of it. 'rhere was also 
an interdict of persons, who were de- 
prived of the benefit of attending on di- 
vine service. Particular persons were 
also anciently interdicted of fire and wa- 
ter, which signifies a banishment for 
some particular offence: by this censure 
no person was permitted to i-eceive 
them, or allow them fire or water ; and, 
being thus wholly deprived of the two 
necessary demerits of life, they were, 
doubtless, under a kind of civil death. 

INTEREST IN CHRIST, a term 
often rhade use of in the religious world ; 
and implies our having a right to claim 
him as our mediator, surety, advocate, 
and saviour, and with him all those spi- 
ritual blessings which are purchased and 
applied by him to those whom he has 
redeemed. The term, "having a 
right to clai)n him" perhaps, is pre- 
ferable to that often used, " being ena- 
bled to claim him," as many have an 
interest in Christ who are destitute of 
that assurance which gives them a com- 



fortable sense thereof. Ridgley's Div.

INTERIM, the name of a formulary, 
or confession of faith, obtruded upon the 
Protestants, after the death of Luther, 
bythe emperor Charles V. when he had 
defeated tneir forces. It was so called, 
because it was only to take place in the 
i?iterim, till a general council should de- 
cide all the points in question between 
the Protestants and Catholics. Tlie oc- 
casion of it was this : The emperor had 
made choice of three divines, viz. Julius 
Phlug, bishop of Naumberg; Michael 
Helding, titular bishop of Sidon; and 
John Agricola, preacher to the elector 
of Brandenburgh ; who drew up a pro- 
ject, consisting of 26 articles, concerning 
the points of religion in dispute between 
the Catholics and Protestants. The 
contro\'erted points were, the state of 
Adam before and after his fall ; the re- 
demption of mankind by Jesus Christ ;. 
the justification of sinners ; charity and 
good works ; the confidence we ought 
to have in God ; that our sins are re- 
mitted ; the church and its time marks, 
its power, its authority, and ministers ; 
the pope and bishops ; the sacraments ;• 
the mass ; the commemoration of saints ; 
their intercession ; and prayers for the 
dead. 

The emperor sent this project to the 
pope for his approbation, which he re- 
fused : whereupon Charles V. published 
the imperial constitution, called the In- 
terim, wherein he declared, that "it 
was his will, that all his Catholic domi- 
nions should, for the future, inviolably 
observe the customs, statutes, and ordi- 
nances of the universal church ; and 
that those who had separated them- 
selves from it, should either reunite 
themselves to it, or at least conform to 
this constitution ; and that all should 
quietly expecl the decisions of the gene- 
ral council." This ordinance was pub- 
lished in the diet of Augsburgh, May 15, 
1548 ; but this device neither pleased 
the pope nor the Protestants : the Lu- 
theran preachers openly declared they 
would not receive it, alleging that it re- 
established popery : some chose rather 
to quit their chairs and livings than to 
subscribe it ; nor would the duke of 
Saxony receive it. Calvin, and several 
others wrote against it. On the other 
side, the emperor was so severe against 
those who refused to accent it, that he 
disfranchised the cities of Magdeburg 
and Constance for their opposition. 

INTERMEDIATE STATE, a term 
made use of to denote the state of the 
soul between death and tlie resurrection. 



INT 2- 

Ffom the Scriptures speakint^ frequent- 
ly of the dead as sleeping in their graves, 
many have supposed that the soul sleeps 
till the resurrection, i. e. is in a state of 
entire insensibility. But against this 
opinion, and that the soul, after death, 
enters immediately into a state of re- 
ward or punishment, the following pas- 
sages seem to be conclusive. Matt. xvii. 
r&gt;. Luke xxiii. 42. 2 Cor. v. 6. Phil. i. 21. 
Luke xvi. 22, 23. Rev. vi. 9: See arti- 
cles Resurrp:ction, Soul, and Fu- 
ture State ; Bishofi Larys ylpfitm- 
dijctohis Theory of Religion ; Search's 
Light of jYatu're pursued ; Bennett's 
Oiam Ifaneshamoth, or View of the In- 
termediate State; Archibald CampbelTs 
View of the Middle State ; Archdeacoyi 
Blacklnirnc's Historical View of tlie 
Controversy concerning an Intermedi- 
ate State, and the separate E.vist-ence of 
the Soul between Death and the general 
Resurrectio7i ; in which last the reader 
will find a large account of the writings 
on this subject, from the beginning of 
the Reformation to almost the present 
time. See also Doddridge's Lectures, 
lect 219 

INTERPRETING OF TONGUES, 
a gift bestowed on the apostles and pri- 
mitive Christians, so that in a mixed as- 
sembly, consisting of persons of different 
nations, if one spoke in a language, un- 
derstood by one part, another could I'c- 
peat and translate what he said into dif- 
iei-ent languages understood bv others, 
1 Cor. xii. 10. 1 Cor. xiv. 5, 6, i3. 

INTOLERANCE is a word chiefly 
used in reference to those persons, 
churches, or societies, who do not allow 
men to think for themselves, but impose 
on them articles, creeds, ceremonies. 
Sec. of their own devising. See Tole- 
ration. Nothing is more abhorrent 
from the genius of the Christian reli- 
gion than an intolerant spirit, or an in- 
tolerant church. "It has inspired its 
votaries Avith a savage ferocity; has 
plunged the fatal dagger into innocent 
blood; depopulated towns and king- 
doms; overthrown states and empires, 
and brought down the righteous ven- 
geanc'eof heaven upon a guilt)" world. 
The pretence of superior knowledge, 
sanctity, and' authority for its support, 
is' the disgrace of reason, the grief of 
wisdom, and the paroxysm of fcjlly. 
To fetter the conscience, is injustice ; 
to ensnare it, is an act of sacrilege ; 
but to tortvire it, by an attempt to 
force its feelings, is horrible intolerance ; 
it is the most abandoned violation of all 
the maxims of religion and morality. 
Jesus Christ formed a kingdom purely 

spiritual : the apostles exercised only a 



5 INV 

spiritual authority under the direction 
of Jesus Christ ; particular churches 
were united only by faith and love ; in 
all civil affairs they submitted to civil 
magistracy ; and in religious concerns 
they were governed by the reasoning, 
advice, and exhortations of their own 
officers : their censures were only honest 
reproofs ; and their excommunications 
were only declarations that such of- 
fenders, being incorrigible, were no 
longer accounted members of their 
commmiities." Let it ever be remem- 
bered, therefore, that no man or men 
have any authority whatever from 
Christ over the consciences of others, 
or to persecute the persons of any 
whose religions principles agree not 
witli their own. See Lowell's Ser?no7h% 
ser. 6; Robinson's Claude, vol. ii. p 
227, 299; Saurin's Ser. 3d. vol. p. 30, 
preface; Locke on Government and 
Toleration. 

INTREPIDITY, a disposition of 
mind unaffected with fear at the ap- 
proach of danger. Resolution either 
I banishes fear or surmounts it, and is 
firm on all occasions. Courage is impa- 
tient to attack, undertakes boldly, and 
is not lessened by difficulty. Valour acts 
with vigour, gives no way to resistance, 
but pursues an enterprise in spite of op- 
position. Bravery knows no fear ; it 
runs nobly into danger, and prefers 
honour to life itself. Intrepidity en- 
counters the greatest points with the 
utmost coolness, and dares even present 
death. See Courage, Fortitude. 

INVESTITURE, in ecclesiastical 
policy, is the act of confemng any be- 
nefice on anotlier. It v/as customary for 
princes to make investiture of ecclesK 
astical benefices, by delivering to the 
jjerson they had chosen a pastoral staff 
and a ring. The account of this cere- 
mony may be seen at large in Mosheim's 
Ecclesiastical History, cent. xi. part ii, 
chap. 2. 

INVISIBLES, a name of distinction 
given to the disciples of Osiander, Fla- 
cius, Illyricus, Swenkfeld, &amp;c. because 
they denied the perpetual visibility of 
the church. 

INVOCATION, a calling upon God 
in prayer. It is generally considei'ed as 
jj the first part of that necessary duty, and 
ji includes, 1. A making mention of one or 
! more of the names or titles of God, in- 
I dicative of the object to whom we pray. 
i| —2. A declaration of our desire and de- 
sign to worship him. And, 3. A desire 
of his assistance and acceptance, under 
a sense of our own unworthiness. In the 
church of Rome, invocation also signi- 
fies adoration of, and prayers to th" 



JOA

IRR 



saints. The council of Trent expressly 
teaches, that the saints who reign with 
Jesus Christ offer up their prayers to 
God for men, and condemn those who 
maintain the contrary doctrine. The 
Protestants censure and reject this opi- 
nion, as contrary to Scripture ; deny the 
truth of the fact ; and think it highly 
unreasonable to suppose that a limited, 
finite being, should be in a manner om- 
nipresent, and, at one and the same time, 
hear and attend to the prayers that are 
offered up to him in England, China, 
and Peru ; and from hence infer, that, if 
the saints cannot hear their request, it is 
inconsistent with common sense to ad- 
dress any kind of praver to them. 

.TOACHIMITES,the disciples of Joa- 
chim, abbot of Flora, in Calabria. Joa- 
chim was a Cistercian monk, and a great 
Eretender to inspiration. He relates of 
imself, that, bemg very young, he went 
to Jerusalem in the dress of a hermit to 
visit the holy places : and that, while he 
was in prayer to God in the church of 
that city, God communicated to liim, by 
infusion, the knowledge of divine mvs- 
teries, and of the Holy Scriptures. He 
■wrote against Lombard, the master of 
the sentences, who had maintained that 
there was but one essence in God, 
though there were three persons ; and 
he pretended, that, since there were 
three persons there must be three es- 
sences. This dispute was in the year 
1195. Joachim's writings were con- 
demned by the fourth Lateran council. 
His followers, the Joachimites, were 
particularly fond of certain ternaries. 
The Father they - iil&amp;d, operated from 
the beginning until the coming of the 
Son : the Son from that time to theirs, 
viz. the year 1260 ; and the Holy Spirit 
then took it up, and was to operate in 
his turn. They likewise divided every 
thing relating to men, doctrine, and 
manner of living, into three classes, ac- 
cordingto the three persons of theTri- 
nity. The first ternary was that of 
men ; of whom, the first class was that 
of married men, which had lasted during 
the whole period of thfe Father ; the se- 
cond was that of clerks, which lasted 
during the time of the Son ; and the last 
was that of monks, wherein was to be 
an uncommon effusion of grace by the 
Holy Spirit.. The second ternary was 
that of doctrine, viz. the Old Testa- 
ment, the New, and the everlasting 
Gospel ; the first they ascribed to the 
Father, the second to the Son, and the 
third to the Holy Spirit. A third ternary 
consisted in the mianner of living, viz. 
under the Father, men lived according 
to the flesh ; under the Son, they lived 



according to the flesli and the spirit; 
and under the Holy Ghost, they were 
to live according to the spirit only.

tians. 

JOY, a delight of the mind arising 
from the consideration of a present or 
assured approaching possession of a fu- 
ture good. When it is moderate, it is 
called glad?iess ; when raised on a sud- 
den to the highest degree, it is then 
exultation or transport; when w'e limit 
our desh-es by our possessions, it is con- 
tentJnent ; when our desires ar'e raised 
high, and yet accomplished, this is called 
satisfaction ; when our joy is derived 
from some comical occasion or amuse- 
ment, it is mirth ; if it arise from consi- 
derable opposition that is vanquished in 
the pursuit of the good we desire, it is 
then called triumph; when joy has so 
long possessed the mind that it is settled 
into a temper, we call it cheerfulness ; 
when we rejoice upon the account of any 
good which others obtain, it may be 
called sympathy or congratulation. 
This is natural joy ; but there is, — 2. A 
moral joy, which is a self- approbation, 
or that which arises from the perform- 
ance of any good actions ; this is called 
peace, or serenity of conscience : if the 
action be honourable, and the jov rise 
high, it may be called glory. — 3. There 
is also a spiritual joy, which the Scrip- 
ture calls a " fruit of the Spirit," Gal. 
V. 22. " the joy of faith." Phil. i. 25. and 
" the rejoicing of hope," Heb. iii. 6. The 
objects of it are, 1. God himself, Ps. xliit 
4. Is. xli. 10.— 2. Christ, Phil. iii. 3. 1 
Pet. i. 8. — 3. The promises, Ps. cxix. 
162. — 4. The administration of the Gos- 
pel, and Gospel ordinances, Ps. Ixxxix. 
15. — 5. The prosperity of the interest of 
Christ, Acts XV. 3. Rev. xi. 15, 17. — 6. 
The happiness of a future state, Rom. 
V. 2. Matt. XXV. The nature a?id pro- 
perties of this joy : 1. It is or should be 
constant, Phil. iv. 4. — 2. It is unknown 
to the men of the world, 1 Cor. ii. 14. — 
3. It is unspeakable, 1 Pet. i. 8. — 4. It is 
permanent, John xvi. 22. Watts on the 
Pass. sect. 11 ; Gill's Body of Div. p. 
111.3d. vol. 8vo. edit.; Grove'^s Mar. 
Phil. vol. i. p. 356. 

JOY OF GOD relates, 1. To the de- 
light and complacency he has in him- 
self, his own nxiture, and perfections. — 
2. He rejoices in his own works, Ps. civ. 
31. — 3. In his Son Christ Jesus, Matt, 
iii. 17. — 4. In the work of redemption, 
John iii. 15. — 5. In the subjects -of his 
grace, Ps. cxlvii. 11. Zeph. iii. 17. Ps. 
cxlix. 4.

JUB 



ISBRANIKI, a denomination whicli I 
appeared in Russia about the yetn- 1666, 
and assumed this name, which signifies 
the multitude of the elect. But they 
were called by their adversaries Rols- 
kolsnika, or the seditious faction. They 
professed a rigorous zeal for the letter 
of the Holy Scriptures. They main- 
tained that there is no subordination of 
rank among the faithful, and that a 
Christian may kill himself for the love 
of Christ. 

ISRAELITES, the descendants of Is- 
rael, who were at fii-st called Hebrews, 
by reason of Abraham, who came from 
the other side of the Euphrates ; and 
afterwards Israelites, from Israel, the 
father of the twelve patriarchs; and, 
lastly, Jews, particularlv after their re- 
turn from the captivitv of Babylon, be- 
cause the tribe of Judah was then much 
stronger and more numerous than the 
other tribes, and foreigners had scarce 
any knowledge of this tribe. For the 
history of this people, see article Jews. 

ITINERANT PREACHERS, those 
■who are not settled over any particular 
congregation, but go from place to place 
for the pui-pose of preaching to, and in- 
structing the ignorant. A great deal 
has been said against persons of this de- 
scription ; and, it must be acknowledged, 
that there would not be so much neces- 
sity for them, were every minister of his 
parish to do his duty. But the sad de- 
clension of morals in many places ; the 
awful ignorance that prevails as to God 
and real religion ; the little or no exer- 
tion of those who are the guides of the 
people ; " villages made up of a train 
of idle, profligate, and miserable poor, 
and where the barbarous rhymes in 
their church-yards inform us that they 
are all either gone or going to hea\'en :" 
these things, with a variety of others, 
form a sufficient reason for every able 
and benevolent person to step forward, 
and to do all that he can to enlighten 
the minds, lessen the miseries, and pro- 
mote the welfare of his fellow-crea- 
tures. A clergyman of the church 6f 
England, of respectable talents, very 
judiciously observes, that, " Notwith- 
standing the prejudices of mankind, and 
the indiscretions of some individuals, an 
itineratit teacher is one of the most ho- 
nourable and useful characters that can 
be found upon earth ; and there needs 
no other proof than the experience of 
the church in all ages, that, when this 
work is done properly and with perse- 
verance, it forms the grand method of 
spreading wide, and rendering effica- 
cious religious knowledge, for great re- 
formations and revivals of religion have 



uniformly been thus effected ; and it is 
especially sanctioned by the example of 
Chi-ist and his apostles, and recommend- 
ed as the divine method of spreading the 
Gospel through the nations of the earth ; 
itinerant preaching having almost al- 
ways preceded and made way for the 
solid ministry of regular pastors. But it 
is a work which requires peculiar ta- 
lents and dispositions, and a peculiar 
call in God's pi-ovidence ; and is not 
rashly and hastily to be ventured upon 
by every novice who has learned to 
speak about the Gospel, and has more 
zeal than knowledge, prudence, hu- 
mility, or experience. An unblemished 
character, a disinterested spirit, an ex- 
emplary deadness to the world, unaf- 
fected humility, deep acquaintance with 
the human heart, and preparation for 
enduring the cross not only with bold- 
ness, but with meekness, patience, and 
sweetness of temper, are indispensably 
necessary for such a service." 

JUBILEE, a public festivity. — Among 
the Jews it was held every 49th or 50th 
year. It was proclaimed with the sound 
of rams' horns: no servile work was 
done on it ; the land lay untilled ; what 
grew of itself belonged to the poor and 
needy ; whatever debts the Hebrews 
owed to one another were wholly re- 
mitted ; hired as well as bond-sel'vants 
of the Hebrew race obtained their liber- 
ty ; inheritances reverted to their ori- 
ginal proprietors. See 25th chap. Levi- 
ticus. Jubilee, in a more modern sense, 
denotes a grand church solemnity or 
ceremony, celebrated at Rome, where- 
in the pope grants a plenary indulgence 
to all sinners ; at least to as many as 
visit the churches of St. Peter and St. 
Paul, at Rome. The jubilee was first 
established by Boniface VII. in 1300, 
which was only to return every hundred 
years ; but the first celebration brought 
in such store of wealth, that Clement 
VI. in 1343, reduced it to the period of 
fifty years. Urban VI. in 1389, appoint- 
ed it to be held every thirty-five years, 
that being the age of^ our Saviour ; and 
Paul II. and Sixtus IV. in 1475, brought 
It down to every twenty-five, that eveiy 
person might have the' benefit of it once 
in his life. Boniface IX. granted the 
privilege of holding jubilees to several 
princes and monasteries ; for instance, 
to the monks of Canterbury, who had a 
jubilee every fifty years, when people 
flocked from all parts to visit the tomb 
of Thomas-a-Becket. Afterwards jubi- 
lees became more frequent : there is 
generally one at the inauguration of a 
new pope ; and the pope grants them 
as often as the church or himself have 



JIJD

JUD 



occasion for thein. To be entitled to the 
privileges of the jubilee, the bull enjoins 
fasting, tilnis, and prayers. It gives the 
priests a full power to absolve in all 
cases, even those otherwise reserved to 
the pope; to make commutations of 
vows, Sec. in which it diflers from a 
plenary Indulgence. During the time of 
jubilee, all other indulgences are sus- 

i)ended. One of our kings, viz. Edward 
II. caused his birth-day to l)e observed 
in the manner of a jubUee, when he be- 
came fifty years of age, in 1362, but 
never before nor aftei\ This he did by 
releasing pi'isoners, pardoning all offen- 
ces, except treason, making good laws, 
and granting many privileges to the peo- 
ple. In 1640, the Jesuits celel)rated a 
solemn jubilee at Rome, that being the 
centenary, or hundredth year from their 
institution; and the same ceremony was 
ol&gt;ser\-ed in all their houses throughout 
the world. 

JUDAISING CHRISTIANS: the 
first rise of tliis denomination is placed 
under the reign of Adrian. For when 
this emperor had at length razed Jeru- 
salem, entirely destroyed its very foun- 
dations, and enacted laws of the seve- 
rest kind against the wliole body of tlie 
Jewish people, the greatest part of the 
("hristians wlio lived in Palestine, to 
prevent their being confounded with the 
.Tews, abandoned entirely the Mosaic 
i-ites, and chose a bishop, namely, Mark, 
a foreignt- r by nation, and an alien from 
tlie commonwealth of Israel. I'hosc 
who wei'e strongly attached to the Mo- 
saic rites, separated from their bi'etliren, 
and founded at Pera, a country of Pales- 
tine, and in the neighbouring parts, par- 
ticular assemblies, in which the law of 
Moses maintained its primitive dignity, 
authoritv, and lustre. The body of Ju- 
daising Christians, which set Moses and 
Christ upon an etjual footing in point of 
authority, were afterwards divided into 
two sects, extremely different' both in 
their rites and opinions, and distinguish- 
ed l)y the names of Nazarenes and Ebi- 
onites ; which see. 

JUDAISM, the religious doctrines 
and rites of the Jews, the descendants of 
Abraham. Judaism was but a te:iipora- 
ry dispensation, and was to gi\'e way, tit 
least the ceremonial part of it, at the 
coming of the Messiah. The principal 
sects among the Jews were the Phari- 
sees, who placed religion in external 
ceremony ; the Sadducees, who' were 
remarkable for their incredulity ; and 
the Essenes, who were distinguished for 
their austere sanctity. At present, the 
Jews have two sects; the Caruites, -who 
admit no rule of religion but the law of 



Moses; and the Rabhhusts, who add to 
the law the traditions of the Talmud. 
See those articles, and books recom- 
mended under article Jews, in thks 
work. 

JUDGING RASH, the act of care- 
lessly, precipitately, wantonlv, or ma- 
liciously censuring others. This is an 
evil which abounds too much among al- 
most all classes of men. " Not contented 
with being in the right ourselves, we 
nuist find all others in the wrong. We 
claim an exclusive possession of good- 
ness and v/isdom ; and from approving 
warmly of those who join us, we pro- 
ceed to condemn, with much acrimony, 
not only the principles, but the cha- 
racters of those from whom we differ. 
We rashly extend to every individual 
the severe opinion which we have un- 
warrantably conceived of a whole body. 
This man is of a party whose principles 
we reckon slavish ; and therefore his 
whole sentiments are corrupted. That 
man lielongs to a religious sect, which 
we are accustomed to deem bigoted, 
and therefore he is inca])able of any 
j generous and liberal thought. Another 
I is connected with a sect, which we have 
been taught to account relaxed, and 
! therefore he can have no sanctity. We 
j should do well to consider, 1. Tliat this 
i practice of rash judging is aljsolutely 
i forbidden in the sacred Scriptures, Mat. 
j vii. 1. — 2. We thereby authorize others 
I to i-equite us in the same kind. — 3. It 
} often evidences our pride, envy, and bi- 
gotry. — 4. It argues a want of cl^arit\ , 
the distinguishing feature of the Chris- 
tian religion. — 5. They who are most 
forward in censuring others are often 
most defective themseh'es. Barrow^'} 
irorkft, vol. i. scr. 2'0 ; Blair's Ser. scr. 
10. vol. ii ; Saurbi's Se7\ ser. 4. vol. v. • 
JUDGMENT is that act of the mind 
whereby one thing is affirmed or denied 
of another; or that power of the soul 
wliich passes sentence on things propos- 
ed to its examination, and determines 
what is right or wrong: anrl thus it ap- 
]' oves or disappro\es of an action, or an 
object considered as true or false, fit or 
unfit, good or e\'il. Dr. Watts gives us 
the following directions to assist us in 
judging right. 1. We shoidd examine all 
our old opinions afresh, and enquire what 
was the ground of them, and whether 
our assent wqre built on just evidence ; 
and then we should cast off all those 
judgments which were formed hereto- 
fore without due examination. — 2. All 
om- ideas of oljjects, concerning which 
we pass judgment, should be clear, dis- 
tinct, complete, comprehensive, exten- 
sive, and orderly .^3. When we have 



JUD 



279 



JUD 



obtained as clear ideas as we can, both 
of the subject and predicate of a propo- 
sition, then we must compare those ideas 
of the subject and predicate together 
with the utmost attention, and observe 
how far thev agree, and wherein they 
differ. — 4. W'e must search for evidence 
of tnith, with dihgence and honesty, and 
be heartily ready to receive e\idence, 
whether for the agreement or disagree- 
ment of ideas. — 5. We must suspend 
our judgment, and neither affirm nor 
deny until this evidence appear. — 6. We 
must judge of every proposition by those 
proper and peculiar means or mediums, 
whereby the evidence of it is to be ob- 
tained, whether it be sense, conscious- 
ness, intelligence, reason, or testimony. 
— 7. It is very useful to have some ge- 
neral principles of truth settled in the 
mind, whose evidence is great and ob- 
vious, that they may be always ready at 
hand to assist us in judging of the great 
\ ariety of things which occur. — 8. Let 
the degrees of our assent to every pro- 
position bear an exact proportion to the 
different degrees of evidence. — 9. We 
should keep our minds always open to 
receive truth, and never set limits to our 
own improvements. IVatts's J^ogic, ch.

JUDGMENT, LAST, the sentence 
that will be passed on our actions at the 
last day. 

L The proofs of a general judgment 
ai'e these : 1. Tlie justice of God re- 
quires it ; for it is evident that this at- 
tribute is not clearly displayed in the 
dispensation of things hi the present 
state, 2 Thess. i. 6, 7. Luke xiv. 26.— 
2. The accusations of natural con- 
science are testimonies in favour of this 
belief, Rom. ii. 15. Dan. v. 5, 6. Acts 
xxiv. 25. — 3. It may be concluded from 
the relation men stand in to God, as 
creatures to a Creator. He has a i-ight 
to give them a law, and to make them 
accountable, for the breach of it, Rom. 
xiv. 12. — 4. The resurrection of Christ 
is a certain proof of it. See Acts xvii. 
31. Rom. xiv. 9. — 5. The Scripture, in 
a variety of places, sets it beyond all 
doubt, Jude 14, 15. 2 Cor. v. 10. Matt. 
XXV. Rom. xiv. 10, 11. 2 Thess. i. 7, 10. 
1 Thess. iv. 16, 17. 

II. As to the Judge: the Bible de- 
clares that God will judge the world by 
Jesus Christ, Acts xvii. 31. The triune 
God will be the Judge, as to original au- 
thority, power, and right of judgment ; 
but, according to the economy settled 
between the three divine persons, the 



work is assigned to the Son, Romans 
xiv. 9 and 10, who will appear in his 
human nature, John v. 27. Acts xvii. 31. 
with great power and glory, 1 Thess. 
iv. 16, 17. visible to eveiy eye. Rev. i. 7. 
penetrating every heart, 1 Cor. iv. 5.

Matt, xxviii. 18. and acting with strict 
justice, 2 Tim. iv. 8. As for the concern 
of others in the judgment ; angels will 
j be no otherwise concerned than as at- 
tendants, gathering the elect, raising 
the dead, &amp;c. but not as advising or 
judging. Saints are said to judge the 
world ; not as co-judgers with Christ,- 
but as approvers of his sentence, and as 
their holy lives and conversations will 
rise up in judgment against their wicked 
neighbours. 

III. As to the persons that will be 
judged ; these will be men and devils. 
The righteous, probably, will be tried 
fii'st, as represented in Matt. xxv. They 
will be raised first, though perhaps not 
a thousand years before the rest, as Dr. 
Gill supposes ; since the resurrection of 
all the bodies of the saints is spoken of 
as in- a moment, in the twinkling of an 
eye, at the last trump, in order to their 
meeting the Lord in the air, and being 
with him not on earth, but for ever in 
heaven, 1 Cor. xv. 52. 1 Thess. iv, 
16, 17. 

Here we may talce notice of a diffi- 
cult question which is proposed by 
some, namely. Whether the sins of God's 
/leo/ile shall be fiublished in the great 
day, though it is certain they shall not 
be alleged against them to their con- 
demnation ? "This," says Dr. Ridgle}% 
" is one of the secret things which be- 
long to God, which he has not so fully 
or clearly revealed to us in his word ; 
and therefore we can say little more 
than what is matter of conjecture about 
it. Some have thought that the sins of 
the godly, though forgiven, shall be 
made manifest, that so the glory of that 
grace which has pardoned them may 
appear more illustrious, and their obli- 
gation to God for this farther enhanced. 
They also think, that the justice of the 
proceedings of that day requires it, 
since it' is presumed and known by the 
whole world that they were prone to 
sin, as well as others ; and, before con- 
version, as great sinners as any, and af- 
ter it their sins had a peculiar aggrava- 
tion. Therefore, why should not they 
be made public, as a glory due to the 
justice and holiness of God, whose na- 
ture is opposite to all sin .^ And this they 
farther suppose to be necessary, that so 
the impartiality of divine ju.s"tice may 
appear Moreover, since God, by yp-

cording the sins of his saints in Scripture, 
has perpetuated the knowledge tliere- 
of ; and if it is to their honour that the 
sins there mentioned were repented of,' 
as well as forgiven, why may it not be 
supposed that the sins of believers shall 
be made known in the great day ? And, 
besides, this seems agreeable to those 
expressions of every, word, and every 
action, as being to be In-ought into judg- 
ment, whether it be good, or whether it 
be bad. 

"But it is supposed by others, that 
though the making known of sin that is 
subdued and forgiven, tends to the ad- 
vancement of divine grace, yet it is 
sufficient to answer this end, as far as 
God designs it shall be answered, that 
the sins which have been subdued and 
forgiven, should he known to themselves, 
and thus forgiveness afford matter of 
praise to God. Again ; the expressions 
of Scripture, whereby forgiveness of 
shi IS set forth, aie sucli as seem to ar- 
sue that those sins which were. forgiven 
shall not be made manifest : thus they 
are said to be blotted out, Isa. xliii. 25. 
covered, Ps. xxxii. 1. subdued and cast 
into the depths of the sea, Micah vii. 19. 
and remembcrea 710 iiiore, &amp;c. Jer. xxxi. 
34. Besides, Christ's being a judge, doth 
not divest him of the character of an 
ad\"ocate, whose part is rather to con- 
ceal tlie crimes of those whose cause he 
ple-ads, than to di\adge them ; and to 
this we may add, that the law which 
requires duty, and forbids the contrary 
sins, is not the I'ule by which they who 
are in Christ are to be proceeded 
against, for then they could not stand in 
judgment ; but they are dealt with ac- 
cording to the tenor of the Gospel,which 
forgives and covers all sin. And, farther, 
it is argued that the public declaring of 
all their sins before the whole Avorld, 
notwithstanding their interest in for- 
giving grace, would fill them with such 
shame as is hardly consistent with a state 
of perfect blessedness. And, lastly, the 
principal argument insisted on is, that 
our Saviour, in Matt. xxv. in which he 
gives a particular account of the pi'o- 
ceedings of that day, makes no mention 
of the sins, but only commends the gra- 
ces of his saints." 

As to Jhe wicked, they shall be judg- 
ed, and all their thoughts, woi'ds, and 
deeds, be brought into judgment, Ecc. 
xii. 14. The fallen angels, also, are said 
to be reserved unto the judgment of the 
great day, Jude 6. They shall receive 
their final sentence, and be shut up in 
the prison of hell, Rev. xx. 10. Matt, 
viii. 29. 

IV. Js to the rule of judgment: we 



are informed the books will be opened, 
Rev. XX. 12. — 1. The book of divine om- 
niscience, Mai. iii. 5. or remembrance, 
Mai. iii. 16. — 2. The book of conscience, 
Rom. i. 15. — 3. The book of providence, 
Rom. ii. 4, 5. — 4. The book of the Scrip- 
tures, Law, and Gospel, John xii. 48. 
Rom. ii. 16. ii. 12. — 5. The book of life, * 
Luke X. 20. Rev. iii. 5. xx. 12, 15. 

V. ^4s to the time of judgment : the 
soul will either be happy or miserable 
immediately after death, but the gene- 
ral judgment will not be till after the 
resurrection, Heb. ix. 27. There is a 
day appointed, Acts xvii. 31. but it is 
unknown to men. 

VL As to the place: this also is un- 
cei'tain. Some suppose it will be in the 
air, because the Judge will come in the 
clouds of hea\'en, and the li\ ing saints 
will then be changed, and the dead 
saints raised, and both be caught up to 
meet the Lord in the air, 1 Thess. iv. 
16, 17. Others think it will be on the 
earth, on the new earth, on which they 
will descend from the air with Christ. 
The place luhere, however, is of no 
consequence, when compared with the 
state in rohich we shall a]:)pear. And as 
the Scriptures represent it as certain, 
Eccl. xi. 9. universal, 2 Cor. v. 11. 
righteous, Rom. ii. 5. decisive, 1 Cor. xv. 
52. and eternal as to its consequences, 
Heb. vi. 2. let us be concerned for the 
welfare of our immortal interests, flee 
to the refuge set before us, improve our 
precious time, depend on the merits of 
the Redeemer, and adhere to the dic- 
tates of the divine word, that we may 
be found of him in peace. Bates's

JUDGMENTS OF GOD, are the 
punishments inflicted by him for par- 
ticular crimes. The Scriptures give us 
many awful instances of the display of 
divine justice in the punishment of na- 
tions, families, and indi\ idurJs, for their 
iniquities. See Gen. vii. xix. 25. Exod. 
XV. Judges i. 6, 7. Acts xii. 23. Esther 
v. 14. with chap. vii. 10. 2 Kings xi. 
Lev. X. 1, 2. Acts v. 1 to 10. Is. xxx. 
1 to 5. 1 Sam. xv. 9. 1 Kings xii. 25, 33. 
It becomes us, hov,e\er, to be exceed- 
ingly cautious ho.w we interpret the 
severe and afflictive dispensations ot 
Providence. Dr. Jortin justly observes, 
that there is usually much rashness and 
presumption in pronouncing that tht 
calamities of sinners are particular judg- 
! ments of God; yet, saith he, if from sa-

cred and profane, from ancient and mo- 
dern historians, a collection were made 
of all the cruel persecuting tyrants who 
delighted in tormenting their fellow- 
creatures, and who died not the common 
death of all men, nor were visited after 
the visitation of all men, but whose 
plagues were horrible and strange, even 
a sceptic would be moved at the evi- 
dence, and would be apt to suspect that 
it was Osrdv n, tliat the hand of God was 
in it. As Dr. Jortin was no enthusiast, 
and one who would not overstrain the 
point, we shall here principally follow 
nim in his enumeration of some of the 
most remarkable instances. 

Herod the Great was the first perse- 
cutor of Christianity. He attempted 
to destroy Jesus Christ himself, while 
he was yet but a child, and for that 
■wdcked purpose slew all the male chil- 
dren that were in and about Bethlehem. 
What was the consequence ? Josephus 
hath told us : he had long and grievous 
sufferings, a burning fever, a voracious 
appetite, a difficulty of breathing, swell- 
ings of his limbs, loathsome ulcers with- 
in and without, breeding vermin, violent 
torments and convulsions, so that he en- 
deavoured to kill himself, but was re- 
strained by his friends. The Jews 
thought these evils to be divine judg- 
ments upon him for his wickedness. 
And what is still more remarkable in 
his case is, he left a numerous family of 
children and grand-children, though he 
had put some to death, and yet in about 
the space of one hundred years the 
■whole family was extinct. 

Hei'od Antipas, who beheaded John 
the Baptist, and treated Christ con- 
temptuously when he was brought be- 
fore him, was defeated by Aretas, an 
Arabian king, and afterwards had his 
dominions taken from him, and was 
sent into banishment along with his in- 
famous wife Herodias, by the emperor 
Caius. 

Herod Agi-ippa killed James the bro- 
ther of John, and put Peter in prison. 
The angel of the Lord soon after smote 
him, and he was eaten of worms, and 
gave up the ghost. 

Judas, that betrayed our Lord, died, 
by his own hands, the most ignominious 
of all deaths. 

Pontius Pilate, who condemned our 
blessed Saviour to death, was not long 
afterwards deposed from his office, ba- 
nished from his country, and died by his 
own hands ; the divine vengeance over- 
taking him soon after his crime. 

The high priest Caiaphas, was depo- 
sed by VitelHus, three years after the 
death of Christ. Thus this wicked man. 



who condemned Christ for fear of dis- 
obliging the Romans, was ignominiously 
turned out of his office by the Roman go- 
vernor, whom he had sought to oblige. 

Ananias, the high-priest, persecuted 
St. Paul, and insolently ordered the by- 
standers to smite him on the mouth. 
Upon which the apostle said, God shall 
synite thee, thou nvhited wall. Whether 
he spake this prophetically or not, m.ay 
be difficult to say ; but certain it is, that 
sometime after he was slain, together 
with his brother, by his own son. 

Ananus, the high priest, slew St. 
James the Less; tor which and other 
outrages he was deposed by king Agrip- 
pa the younger, and probably perished 
in the last destiniction of Jerusalem. 

Nero, in the year sixty-four, turned 
his rage upon the Christians, and put to 
death Peter and Paul, with many others. 
Four years after, in his great distress, 
he attempted to kill himself; but being 
as mean-spirited and dastardly as he was 
wicked and cruel, he had not the reso- 
lution to do that piece of justice to the 
world, and was forced to beg assistance. 

Domitian persecuted the Christians 
also. It is said he threw St. John into a 
caldron of boiling oil, and afterwards 
banished him into the isle of Patmos. 
In the following year this monster of 
wickedness was murdered by his own 
people. 

1 he Jewish nation persecuted, reject- 
ed, and crucified the Lord of glory. 
Within a few years after, their naticHi 
was destroyed, and the Lord made their 
plagues wonderful. 

Flaccus was governor of Egypt near 
the time of our Saviour's death, and a 
violent persecutor of the Jews. The 
wrath of God, however, ere long over- 
took him, and he died by the hands of 
violence. 

Catullus was governor of Libya about 
the year seventy-three. He was also 
a cruel persecutor of the Jews, and he 
died misei-ably. For though he was 
only turned out of his office by the Ro- 
■nans, yet he fell into a complicated and 
incurable disease, being sorely torment- 
ed both in body and mind. He was 
dreadfully terrified, and continually cry- 
ing out that he was haunted b^ the 
ghosts of those whom he had murdered ; 
and, not being able to contain himself, 
he leaped out of his bed, as if he were 
tortured with fire and put to the rack. 
His distemper increased till his entrails 
were all corrupted, and came out of 
his body ; and thus he perished, as sig- 
nal an example as ever was known of 
the divine justice rendering to the wick- 
ed according to their deeds.

Caius, the Roman emperov, was a 
^reat persecutor of the Jews and Chris- 
tians, and a blasphemer of the God of 
heaven. Soon after his atrocities, how- 
ever, he was murdered by one of his 
own people. 

Severus, emperor of Rome, was a vio- 
lent and cruel persecutor of the follow- 
ers of Christ. He also, and all his fami- 
ly, perished miserably, about the year 
two hundred after our Saviour. 

About the same time, Saturnius, go- 
vernor of Africa, persecuted the Chris- 
tians and put several of tliem to death. 
Soon after, he went blind. 

Heliogabalus, the emperor, brought a 
new god to Rome, and would needs com- 
pel all his subjects to worship him. 
This was sure to have ended in a per- 
secution of the Christians. But, soon 
after, this vile monster was slain by his 
own soldiers, about the year two hun- 
dred and twenty-two. 

Claudius Herminianus was a cruel 
persecutor of the Christians in the 
second century, and he was eaten of 
woiTns while he lived. 

Decius persecuted the church about 
the year two hundi'cd and fifty : he was 
soon after killed in battle. 

Gallus succeeded, and continued the 
persecution. He, too, was killed the 
year following. 

Valerian, the emperor, luid many 
good qualities ; but yet he was an impla- 
cable enemy to the Lord Jesus Christ 
and his gospel. Some time after he 
came to the throne, he was taken pri- 
soner by Sapor, king of Persia, and used 
like a slave and a dog ; for the Persian 
monarch, from time to time, obliged 
this unhappy emperor to bow himself 
down, and offer him his back, on which 
to set his foot, in order to mount his 
chariot or his horse. He died in this 
miserable state of captivity. 

^milian, governor of Egypt, about 
two hundred and sixty-thi-ee, Avas a 
virulent persecutor of the church of 
Christ. He was soon after strangled by 
order of the emperor. ^ 

Aurelian, the emperor, just intending 
to begin a persecution against the fol- 
lowers of Christ, was killed in the year 
two hundred and seventy-four. 

Maximinus was a persecutor of the 
church. He reigned only three years, 
and then fell under the "hands of vio- 
lence. 

About the year three hundred was 
the greatest possible contest between 
Christ and the Roman emperors, which 
should have the dominion. These illus- 
trious wretches seemed determined to 
blot out the Christian race and name 



from under heaven. The persecution 
was far more fierce and brutal than it 
had ever been. It was time, therefore, 
for the Lord Jesus Christ, the great 
head of the church, to arise and plead 
his own cause : and so, indeed, he did. 
The examples we have mentioned are 
dreadful : these that follow are not less 
astonishing, and they are all delivered 
upon the best authorities. 

Dioclesian persecuted the church in 
three hundred and three. After this 
nothing ever prospered with him. He 
underwent many troubles: his senses 
became impaired ; and he quitted the 
empire. 

Sevenis, another persecuting empe- 
ror, was overthrown and put to death 
in the year three hundred and seven. 

About the same time, Urbanus, go- 
vernor of Palestine, who had signalized 
himself by tormenting and destroying 
the disciples of Jesus, met with his due 
reward; for almost immediately after 
the cruelties committed, the divine ven- 
geance overtook him. He Avas unex- 
pectedly degraded and deprived of all 
his honours ; and, dejected, dispirited, 
and meanly begging for mercy, was put 
to death by the same hand that raised 
him. 

Firmilianus, another persecuting go- 
vernor, met with the same fate. 

Maximianus Herculus, another of the 
wretched persecuting emperqrs, was 
compelled to hang himself, in the year 
three hundred and ten. 

Maximianus Galerius, of all the ty- 
rants of his time the most cruel, was 
seized with a grievous and horrible dis- 
ease, and tormented with worms and 
ulcers to such a degree, that they who 
were ordered to attend him could not 
bear the stench. Worms proceeded 
from his body in a most fearful manner ; 
and several of his physicians were put 
to death because tliey could not endure 
the smell, and others because they could 
not cure him. This happened in the 
year of our Lord three nundred and 
eleven. 

Maxentius, another of the inhuman 
monsters, was overthrown in battle by 
Constantine ; and in his flight he fell in- 
to the Tiber, and was drowned in the 
year three hundred and twelve. 

Maximinus put out the eyes of many 
thousands of Christians. Soon after the 
commission of his cruelties, a disease 
arose among his own people, which 
greatly affected their eyes, and took 
away their sight. He himself died mi- 
serably, and upon the rack, his eyes 
starting out of his head through the vio- 
lence of his distemper, in the year three

hundred and thirteen. All his family 
likewise were destroyed, his wife and 
children put to death, together with 
most of his friends and dependents, who 
had been the instruments of his cruelty. 
A Roman officer, to oblige this Maxi- 
minus, great]}' 'oppressed the church at 
Damascus ; not long after, he destroyed 
himself. 

Licinius, the last of these persecuting j 
emperors before Constantine, was con- ' 
quered and put to death in the year 
three hundred and twenty-three. He 
was equally an enemy to religion, liber- 
ty, and learning. 

Cyril, the deacon, was murdered by 
some Pagans, at Heliopolis, for his op- 
position to their images. They ripped 
open his belly, and ate his liver : the di- 
vine vengeance, however, pursued all 
those who had been guilty of this crime ; 
their teeth came out, their tongues rot- 
ted, and they lost their sight. 

Valens was made emperor in ^64. ; 
and though a Christian himself, he is 
said to have caused foui'score i)resby- 
ters, who differed from him in opinion, 
to be put to sea, and bmnt alive in the 
ship. Afterwards, in a battle with the 
Goths, he was defeated and wounded, 
and fled to a cottage, where he was 
burnt alive, as most historians relate : 
all agree that he pei-ished. 

The last Pagan prince, who was a 
formidable enemy to Christianity, was 
Radagaisus, a king of the Goths. He 
invaded the Roman empire with an ar- 
my of 400,000 men, about the year 405, 
and vowed to sacrifice all the Romans, 
to his gods. The Romans, however, 
fought him, and obtained a complete 
victory, taking him and his sons prison- 
ers, whom they put to death. 

Huimeric, the Vandal, though a 
Christian, was a most cruel persecutor 
. of those who differed from him in opi- 
nion, about the year of our Lord 484. He 
spared not e\en those of his own per- 
suasion, neither his friends nor his kin- 
dred. He reigned, howe\ er, not quite 
eight years, and died with all the marks 
of divine indignation upon him. 

Julian the apostate greatly oppressed 
tlie Christians : and he perished soon 
after, in his rash expedition against the 
Persians. 

Several of those who were employed 
or permitted by Julian to persecute the 
Christians, are' said to have perished 
miserably and remarkably. I will here 
relate the fate of a few of those unhap- 
py wretches in the words of Tillemont, 
who faithfully collected the account from 
the ancients. We have obsened, says 
that learned man, that count Julian, 



with Felix, superintendent of the finan- 
ces, and Elpidius, treasurer to the em- 
peror, apostates all three, had received 
orders to go and seize the effects of the 
church at Antioch, and carry them to 
the treasury. They did it on the day 
of the martyrdom of St. Theodoret, and 
drew up an account of what they had 
seized. But count Julian was not con- 
tent with taking away the sacred vessels 
of the church, and profaning them by 
his impure hands : carrying to greater 
lengths the outrage he was doing to 
Jesus Christ, he o\erturned and flung 
them down on the ground, and sat upon 
them in a most criminal mannei- ; add- 
ing to this all the banters and blasphe- 
mies that he could devise against Christ, 
and against the Christians, who, he said, 
were abandoned of God. 

Felix, the superintendent, signalized 
himself also by another impiety ; for as 
he was viewing the rich and magnificent 
vessels which the emperors Constantine 
and Constantius had given to the church, 
" Behold" said he, " with what plate 
the son of Mary is served !" It is said, 
too, that count Julian and he made it 
the subject of banter, that God should 
let them thus profane his temple, with- 
out interposing by visible miracles. 

But these impieties remained not long 
unjjunished, and Julian had no sooner 
profaned the sacred utensils, than he 
felt the effects of di\ ine vengeance. He 
fell into a grievous and unknown dis- 
ease ; and his inward parts being cor- 
rupted, he cast out his liver and his ex- 
crements, not from the ordinary pas- 
sages, but from his miserable mouth, 
which had uttered so many blasphemies. 
His secret parts, and all the flesh round 
about them, corrupted also, and bred 
worms ; and to show that it was a di- 
vine punishment, all the ait of physi- 
cians could give him no relief. In this 
condition he continued forty days, with- 
out speech or sense, preyed on by 
worms. At length he came to himself 
again. The imposthumes, however, 
all over his body, and the worms which 
gnawed him continually, reduced him 
to the utmost extremity. He threw 
them up, without ceasing, the last three 
days of his life, with a stench which he 
himself could not bear. 

The disease with which God visited 
Felix was not so long. He burst sud- 
denly in the middle of his body, and died 
of an effusion of blood in the couise of 
one day. 

Elpidius was stripped of his effects in 
366, and shut up in prison, where, after 
having continued for some time, he died 
without reputation and honour, cursed

of all the world, and sumamed the apos- 
tate. 

To these instances many move might 
be added neai'er our own times, did oui" 
room permit. These, however, are suf- 
ficient to show us what a fearful thing it 
is to fall into the hands of the living 
God, and how fruitless and awful it is to 
oppose his designs, and to attempt to 
stop the pi-ogi-ess of his Gospel. " Why 
do the heathen rage, and the people 
imagine a vain thing ? He that sitteth in 
the heavens shall laugh ; the Lord shall 
have them in derision. Thou slialt break 
them with a I'od of iron ; thou shalt dash 
them to pieces as a potter's vessel. Be 
wise noAV, therefore, O ye kings ; be in- 
structed, ye judges of the eaith. Serve 
the Loi-d with fear, and rejoice witli 
trembling." Ps. ii. Jortin's Remarks

JUDICIUM DEI, or Judgment of 
God, was a term anciently applied to all 
extraordinary trials of secret crimes ; as 
those by arms and single combat ; and 
the ordeals, or those by fire, or red hot 

gloughshares, by plunging the arm in 
oiling water, or the whole body in cold 
water, in hopes that God would work a 
miracle, rather than suffer ti'uth and in- 
nocence to perish. These customs were 
a long time kept up even among Chris- 
tians, and they ai-e still in use in some 
nations. Trials of this sort were usually 
held in churches, in the presence of the 
bishop, priest, and secular judges, after 
three days fasting, confession, commu- 
nion, and many adjurations and cere- 
monies, described at large by Du 
Cange. 

JIJMPERS, persons so called from 
the practice of jumping during the time 
allotted for religious worship. This 
singular practice began, it is said, in the 
western part of Wales, about the year 
1760. It was soon after defended by 
Mr. William Williams (the Welch 
poet, as he is sometimes called) in a 
pamphlet, which was patronized by the 
abettors of jumping in religious assem- 
blies. Several of the jnore zealous itine- 
I'ant preachers encowaged the people 
to ci-y out gogoniant (the "VN'elcn word 
for gWy,) amen, 8cc. &amp;c. to put them- 
selves in violent agitations : and, finally, 
to jump until they were quite exhaust- 
ed, so as often to be obliged to fall down 
on the floor or the field, where this kind 
of worship was held. 

JUSTICE consists in an exact and 
sci'uoulous regard to the rights of others, 



with a deliberate purpose to preserve 
them on all occasions sacred and invio- 
late. It is often divided into commuta- 
tive and distributative justice. The 
former consists in an equal exchange 
of benefits ; the latter iij an equal dis- 
tribution of rewards and punishments. 
Dr. Watts gives the following rules re- 
specting justice. — " 1. It is just that we 
honour, reverence, and respect those 
who are superiors in anv kind, Eph. vi. 
1, 3. 1 Pet. ii. 17. 1 Tim. v. 17.— 2. 
That we show particular kindness to 
near relations, Prov. xvii. 17. — 3. That 
we love those who love us, and show

JUSTICE OF GOD is that perfection 
whereby he is infinitely righteous and 
just, both in himself and in all his pro- 
ceedings with his creatures. Mr. Ry- 
land defines it thus: "The ardent in- 
clination of his will to prescribe equal 
laws as the supreme governor, and to 
dispense equal rewards and punish- 
ments as the supreme judge." Rev. xvi. 

5. Psal. cxlv. 7. Psal. xcv'ii. 1. — 2. It is 
distinguished into reinunerative and pu- 
nitive justice. Remunerative justice is 
a distribution of rewards, the nile of 
which is not the merit of the creature, 
but his own gracious promise, James i. 
12. 2 Tim. iv. 8. Punitive or vindictive 
justice, is the infliction of punishment 
for any sin committed by men, 2 Thess. 
i. 6. That God will not let sin go un- 
pimished is evident, 1. From the word 
of God, Ex. xxxiv. 6, 7. Numb. xiv. 18.

Isa. i. 13, 14. Psal. v. 5, 6. Heb. xii. 29.

the surety of his people, 1 Pet. iii. 18. — 
4. From all the various natural evils 
which men bear in the present state. 
The use we should make of this doc- 
trine is this: 1. W^e should learn the 
dreadful nature of sin, and the inevita- 
ble ruin of impenitent sinners, Ps. ix. 
17. — 2. We should highly ajjpreciate the 
Lord Jesus Christ, in whom justice is 
satisfied. 1 Pet. iii. 18. — 3. We should 
imitate the justice of God, by cherishing 
an ardent regard to the rights of God, 
and to the rights of mankind. — 4. We 
should abhor all sin, as it strikes directly

at the justice of God. — 5. We should 
derive comfort from the consideration 
that the Judge of all the earth will do 
right, as it regards ourselves, the 
church, and the world at large, Psal.

■ JUSTIFICATION, a forensic terai, 
and signifies the declaring or the pro- 
nouncing a person righteous according 
to law. It stands opposed to condem- 
nation ; and this is the idea of the word 
whenever it is used in an evangelical 
sense, Rom. v. 18. Deut. xxv. 1. Prov. 
xvii. 15. Matt. xii. 37. It does not sig- 
nify to make men holy, but the holding 
and declaring them so. It is defined by 
the assembly thus : " An act of God's 
free grace, in wliich he pardoneth all 
our sins, and accepteth us as righteous 
in his sight only for the righteousness 
of Christ imputed to us, and received 
by faith alone." 

The doctrine of justification, says Mr. 
Booth, makes a very distinguished figure 
in that religion which is from above, and 
is a capital article of that faith which 
was once delivered to the saints. Far 
from being a merely speculative point, 
it spreads its influence through the 
whole body of divinity, runs through all 
Christian experience, and operates in 
every part of^practical godliness. Such 
is its grand importance, that a mistake 
about it has a malignant efficacy, and is 
attended with a long train of dangerous 
consequences. Nor can this appear 
strange, when it is considered, that the 
doctrine of Justification is no other than 
the way of a sinner's acceptance with 
God. Being of such peculiar moment, 
it is inseparably connected with many 
other evangelical truths, the harmony 
and beauty of which we cannot behold 
while this is misunderstood. It is, if 
any thing may be so called, an essential 
article, and certainly requires our most 
serious consideration. 

Justification, in a theological sense, is 
either legal or evangelical. If any per- 
son could be found that had never 
broken the divine law, he might be jus- 
tified by it in a manner strictly legal. 
But in this way none of the human race 
can be justified, or stand acquitted be- 
fore God. For all have sinned ; there 
is none righteous ; no, not one, Rom. iii. 
As sinners, they are under the sentence 
of death by his righteous law, and ex- 
cluded from all hope and mercy. That 
justification, therefore, about which the 



Scriptures principally treat, and which 
reaches the case of a sinner, is not by 
a personal, but an imputed righteous- 
ness ; a righteousness without the law, 
Rom. iii. 21. pi'ovided by grace, and re- 
vealed in the Gospel ; for which reason, 
that obedience by which a sinner is jus- 
tified, and his justification itself, are 
called evangelical. In this affair there 
is the most wonderful display of divine 
justice and boundless grace. Of divine 
justice, if we regard the meritorious 
cause and ground on which the Justifier 
proceeds in absolving the condemned 
sinner, and in pronouncing him righ- 
teous. Of boundless grace, if we consi- 
der the state and character of those per- 
sons to whom the blessing is granted. 
Justification may be farther distinguish- 
ed as being either at the bar of God, and 
in the court of conscience ; or in the 
sight of the world, and before our fellow - 
creatures. The former is by mere grace 
through faith ; and the latter is by- 
works. 

To justify is evidently a divine prero- 
gative. It is God that justijieth, Rom. 
viii. 33. That sovereign Being, against 
whom we have so greatly offended, 
whose law we have broken by ten thou- 
sand acts of rebellion against him, has, 
in the way of his own appointment, the 
sole right of acquitting the guiltv, and 
of pronouncing them righteous. He ap- 
points the way, provides the means, and 
imputes the righteousness; and all in 
perfect agreement with the demands of 
his offended law, and the rights of his 
violated justice. But although this act 
is in some places of the infallible word 
more particularly appropriated person- 
ally to the Father, yet it is manifest that 
all the Three Persons are concerned in 
this grand affaii', and each performs a 
distinct part in this particular, as also 
in the whole economy of salvation. The 
eternal Father is represented as ap- 
pointing the way, and as giving his own 
Son to perform the conditions of our ac- 
ceptance before him, Rom. viii. 32 : the 
divine Son as engaged to sustain the 
curse, and make the atonement ; to fulfil 
the terms, and provide the righteous- 
ness by which we are justified, Tit. ii, 
14 : and the Holy Spirit as revealing to 
sinners the perfection, suitableness, and 
freeness of the Saviour's work, eiiabling 
them to receive it as exhibited in the 
Gospel of sovereign grace ; and testify- 
ing to their consciences complete justi- 
fication by it in the court of heaven, 
John xvi. 8, 14. 

As to the objects of justification, the 
Scripture says, they are sinners, and 
ungodly. For thus runs the divine de-

claration: To him that worketh is the 
reward of justification, and of eternal 
life as connected with it; not reckoned 
of grace, but of debt. But to him that 
VJorketh not, but believeth on Him that 
justifieth — whom ? tlie righteous ? the 
holy :" the eminently pious r nay, verily, 
but the ungodly; \vis faith, or that in 
which he believes, is counted unto him 
for righteousness, Rom. iv. 4, 5. Gal. ii. 
17. Hei-e, then, we learn, that the sub- 
jects of justification, considered in them- 
selves, are not only destitute of a per- 
fect righteousness, but have performed 
no good works at all. They are deno- 
minated and considered as the ungodly, 
■when the blessing is bestowed upon 
them. Not that we are to understand 
that such remain ungodly. " All," says 
Dr. Owen, "that are justified, were be- 
fore ungodly : but all that are justified, 
are, at the same instant, made godly." 
That the mere sinner, however, is the 
subject of justification, appears from 
hence. The Spirit of God, speaking 
in the Scripture, repeatedly declares 
that we are justified by grace. But 
grace stands Ln direct opposition to 
■works. Whoever, therefore, is justified 
by grace, is considered as absolutely un- 
worthy in that vei-y instant when the 
blessing is vouchsafed to him, Rom. iii. 
24. The person, therefore, that is jus- 
tified, is accepted luithout any cause in 
himself. Hence it appears, that if we 
regard the persons who are justified, 
ami their state prior to the enjoyment 
■of the immensely glorious privilege, di- 
vine grace appears, and reigns in all its 
glory. 

As to the way and niaruier in which 
sinners are justified, it may be observed 
that the Divine Being can acquit none 
without a complete righteousness. Jus- 
tification, as before observed, is evidently 
a forensic term, and the thing intended 
by it a judicial act. So that, were a per- 
son to be justified without a righteous- 
ness, the judgment would not be ac- 
cording to truth ; it would be a false and 
unrighteous sentence. That righteous- 
ness l)y which we are justified must be 
equal to the demands of that law ac- 
cording to which the Sovereign Judge 
proceeds in our justification. Many per- 
sons t^lk of conditiojis of justification 
(see article Condition ;) but the only 
condition isthatof/ie?/ec; righteousness : 
this the law requires, nor does the Gos- 
pel substitute anotlier. But where shall 
•we find, or how shall we obtain a justi- 
fying righteousness? Shall we flee to the 
law for relief? Shall we apply with dili- 
gence and zeal to the performance of 
duty, in order to attain the desired end ? 



The apostle positively affinns, that there 
is no acceptance with God by the works 
of the law; and the reasons are evident. 
Our righteousness is imperfect, and 
consequently cannot justify. If justifica- 
tion were by the -vvorks ot men, it could 
not be by grace : it would not be a righ- 
teousness without works. — There would 
be no need of the righteousness of 
Christ ; and, lastly, if justification were 
by the law, then boasting would be en- 
couraged ; whereas God's design, in the 
whole scheme of salvation, is to exclude 
it, Rom. iii. 27. Eph. ii. 8, 9. Nor is 
faith itself our righteousness, or that 
for the sake of which we are justified : 
for, though believers are said to be jus- 
tified by faith, yet not for faith : faith 
can only be considered as the instru- 
ment, and not the cause. That faith is. 
not our righteousness, is evident from the 
following considerations : No man's faith 
is perfect ; and, if it were, it would not 
i be equal to the demands of the divine 
i law. It could not, therefore, without an 
j error in judgment, be accounted a com- 
plete righteousness. But the judgment 
I of God, as before proved, is according 
I to truth, and according to the rights ot 
his law. I'hat obedience by which a 
sinner is justified is called the righ- 
teousness of faith, righteousTiess 'by 
faith, and is represented as revealed to 
faitli ; consequently it cannot be faith 
itself. Faith, in the business of justifi- 
cation, stands opposed to all works ; to 
him that ivorketh not, but believeth. 
Now, if it were our justifying righteous- 
ness, to consider it in such a light would 
be highly improper. For in such a con- 
nection it falls under the consideration 
of a %vork ; a condition, on the perform- 
ance of which our acceptance with God 
is manifestly suspended. If faith itself 
be that on account of which we are ac- 
cepted, then some believers are justified 
by a more, and some by a less perfect 
righteousness, in exact proportion to the 
strength or weakness of their faith. 
That which is the end of the law is our 
i-ighteousness, which certainly is not 
faith, but the obedience of our exalted 
suljstitute, Rom. x. 4. Were faith itself 
our justifying righteousness, we might 
depend upon it before God, and rejoice 
in it. So that according to this hypothe- 
sis, not Christ, but faith, is the capital 
thing ; the object to which we must 
look, which is absurd. When the apos- 
tle says, "faith was imputed to him for 
righteousness," his main desi^ was to 
prove that the etemal Sovereign justi- 
fies freely, without any cause in the 
creature. 
Nor is man's obedience to the Gospel

as to a new and milder law the matter 
of his justification before God. It was 
a notion that some years ago obtained, 
that a relaxation of the law, and the 
severities of it, has been obtained by 
Christ ; and a new law, a remedial law, 
a law of milder terms, has been intro- 
duced by him, which is the Gospel ; the 
terms of which are faith, repentance, 
and obedience ; and though these are 
imperfect, yet, being sincere, they are 
accepted of by God in the room of a per- 
fect righteousness. But every part of this 
scheme is wrong, for the law is not re- 
laxed, nor any of its severities abated ; 
there is no alteration made in it, eithei- 
with respect to its precepts or penalty : 
besides, the scheme is absurd, for it sup- 
poses that the law which a man is now 
under requires only kn imperfect obedi- 
ence : but an imperfect righteousness 
(•annot answer its demands ; for every 
law requires perfect obedience to its 
own precepts and prohibitions. 

Nor is a profession of religion, nor sin- 
cerity, nor good works, at all the ground 
of our acceptance with God, for all our 
righteousness is imperfect, and must 
therefore be entirely excluded. By 
grace, saith the apostle, ye are saved, 
not ofworks,lest any man should boast, 
Eph". ii. 8, 9. Besides, the works of sanc- 
tincation and justification are two dis- 
tinct things: the one is a work of grace 
within men ; the other an act of grace 
for or towards men : the one is imper- 
fect, the other complete ; the one carri- 
ed on gradually, the other done at once. 
See Sanctification. 

If, then, we cannot possibly be justified 
by any of our own performances, nor by 
faith itself, nor even by the graces of 
the Holy Spii-it, where then shall we 
find a righteousness by which we can 
be justified.-' The Scripture furnishes us 
with an answer—" B\- Jesus Christ all 
that believe are justi^ed from all things 
from which they could not be justified 
by the law of IVToses," Acts xiii. 38, 39. 
" He was delivered for our offences, and 
raised again for owr j ustification," Rom. 
iv. 25. "Being justified by his blood, 
we shall be saved from wrath through 
him," Rom. v. 9. The spotless obedi- 
ence, therefore, the bitter sufferings, 
and the accursed death of our heavenly 
Surety, constitute that very righteous- 
ness % which sinners are justified be- 
fore God. That this righteousness is 
imputed to us, and that we are not jus- 
tified by a personal righteousness, ap- 
pears from the Scripture with superior 
evidence. " By the obedience of one 
shall many be made righteous," Rom. 
V. 19. " He hath made him to be sin 



for us who knew no sin, that we might 
be made the righteousnpss of God in 
him," 2 Cor. v. 21. "And be found in 
him, not having mine own righteousness 
which is of the law, but that which is 
through the faith of Christ ; the righ- 
teousness which is of God by faith," 
Phil. iii. 8. See also Jer. xxiii. 6. Dan. 
ix. 24. the whole of the 2nd chapter of 
Galatians. See articles Reconcilia- 
tion, Righteousness. 

As to the properties of justification: 
1. It is an act of God's free grace, with- 
out any merit whatever in the creature, 
Rom. iii. 24. — 2. It is an act of justice as 
well as grace : the law being perfectly 
fulfilled In Christ, and divine justice sa- 
tisfied, Rom. iii. 26. Ps. Ixxxv. 10. — 3. 
It is an individual and instantaneous act 
done at once, admitting of no degi-ees, 
John xix. 30. — 4. It is n-reversible, and 
an unalterable act, Mai. iii. 6. 
/ As to the time of justification, divines 
are not agreed. Some have distinguish- 
ed it into decretive, virtual, and actual 
1. Decretive, is God's eternal purpose 
to justify sinners in time by Jesus Christ. 
— 2. Virtual justification has a refer- 
ence to the satisfaction made by Christ. 
— 3. Actual, is when we are enabled to 
believe in Christ, and by faith are united 
to him. Others say it is eternal, because 
his puipose respecting it was from ever- 
lasting : and that, as the Almighty view- 
ed his people in Christ, they were, of 
consequence, justified in his sight. But 
it appears to me, that the principle on 
which the advocates for this doctrine 
have proceeded is wrong. They have 
confounded the design with the execu- 
tion ; for if this distinction be not kept 
up, the utmost perplexity will follow the 
consideration of every subject which 
relates to the decrees of God ; nor shall 
we be able to form any clear ideas of 
his moral government whatever. To 
say, as one does, that the eternal will of 
God to justify men is the justification of 
them, is not to the purpose'; for, upon 
the same ground, we might as well say 
that the eternal will of God to convert 
and glorify his people is the real con- 
version and glorification of them. That 
it was eternally determined that there 
should be a people who should believe 
in Christ, and that his righteousness 
should be imputed to them, is not to be 
disputed ; but to say that these things 
were really done from eternity (whic]i 
we must say if we believe eternal justi- 
fication,) this would be absurd. It is 
more consistent to believe, that God 
from eternity laid the plan of justifica- 
tion ; that this plan was executed by the 
life and death of Christ ; and that th?

blessing is only manifested, received, 
and enjoyed, when we are regenerated ; 
so that no man can say or has any rea- 
son to conckide, he is justified, until he 
believes in Christ, Rom. v. 1. 

The effects or blessings of justifica- 
tion, are, 1. An entire freedom from all 
penal evils in this life, and that which is 
to come, 1 Cor. iii. 22. — 2. Peace with 
God, Rom. v. 1. — 3. Access to God 
through Christ, Eph. iii. 12. — 4. Accep- 
tance with God, Eph. v. 27.-5. Holy 
confidence and security under all the 
difficulties and troubles of the present 
state, 2 Tim. i. 12. — 7. Finally, eternal 
salvation, Rom. viii. 30. Rom. v. 18. 

Thus we have given as comprehen- 
sive a view of the doctrine of justifica- 
tion as the nature of this work will ad- 
mit ; a doctrine which is founded upon 
the sacred Scriptures; and which, so 
far fi'om leading to licentiousness, as 



some suppose, is of all others the most 
replete with motives to love, depen- 
dence, and obedience, Rom. vi. 1, 2. A 
doctrine which the primitive Christians 
held as constituting the very essence of 
their system ; which our reformers con- 
sidered as the most important point; 
which our venerable martyrs gloried in, 
and sealed with their blood ; and which, 
as the church of England observes, is a 
" very wholesome doctrine, and full of 
comfort." See Dr. Owen on Justifica- 
tion ; Raivlins on Justification; Ed-

KEITHIANS, a party which sepa- 
rated from the Quakers in Pennsylva- 
nia, in the year 1691. They were head- 
ed by the famous George Keith, from 
whom they derived their name. Those 
who persisted in their separation, after 
their leader deserted them, practised 
baptism, and received the Lord's sup- 
per. This party we!re also called 
Quaker Baptists, because they retain- 
ed the language, dress, and manner of 
the Quakers. 

KEYS, power of the, a term made 
use of in reference to ecclesiastical ju- 
risdiction, denoting the power of ex- 
communicating and absolving. The 
Romanists say that the pope has the 
power of the keys, and can open and 
shut paradise as he pleases ; grounding 
their opinion on that expression of Jesus 
Chi-ist to Peter — "I will give thee the 
keys of the kingdom of heaven," Matt. 
XVI. 19. But every one must see that 
this is an absolute perversion of Scrip- 
ture ; for the keys of the kingdom of 
heaven most probably refer to the Gos- 
pel dispensation, and denote the power 
and authority of every faithful mmister 
to preach the Gospel, administer the 
sacraments, and exercise government, 
that men may be admitted to or ex- 
cluded from the church, as is proper. 
See Absolution. 

In St. Gregory we read that it was 
the custom for the popes to send a 
golden key to princes, wherein they in- 



closed a little of the filings of St. Peter's 
chain, kept with such devotion at Rome ; 
and that these keys were worn in the 
bosom, as being supposed to contain 
some wonderful virtues ! Such has been 
the superstition of past ages ! ! 

KIRK SESSIONS, the name of a 
petty ecclesiastical judicatory in Scot- 
land. Each parish according to its ex- 
tent is divided into several particular 
districts, every one of which has its own 
elder and deacons to oversee it. A con- 
sistoiy of the ministers, elders, and dea- 
cons of a parish form a kirk session. 
These meet once a week, the minister 
being their moderator, but without a 
negative voice. It regulates matters re- 
lative to public worship, elections, cate- 
chising, visitations, &amp;c. It judges in 
matters of less scandal ; but greater, as 
adultery, are left to the presbytery, and 
in all cases an appeal lies from it to the 
presbytery. — Kirk sessions have like- 
wise the care of the poor, and poor's 
funds. See Presbyterians.

able treatment, or a constant and habi-

that men are not justified by their f;iith 
in Christ Jesus ; that there is no origi- 
nal sin ; that infants ought not to be 
baptized, and that immersion is the only

authority to preach and administer the 
sacraments ; that men are not obHged

it is lawful to marry manv wives. 

KNOWLEDGE is defined by Mr. 
Locke to be the perception of the con- 
nexion and agreement, or disagreement 
and repugnancy of our ideas. It also 
dertotes learning, or the improvement of 
our faculties by reading ; exfmictice, or 
the acquiring new ideas or truths, by 
seeing a variety of oljjects, and making 
observations upon them in our own 
minds. No man, says the admirable 
Dr. Watts, is obliged to learn and know 
every thing ; this can neither be sought 
nor required, for it is utterly impossiljle : 
yet all persons are under some obliga- 
tion to improve their own understand- 
ing, otherwise it will be a barren desert, 
or a forest overgrown with weeds and 
brambles. Universal ignorance, or infi- 
nite error, will overspread the mind 
which is utterly neglected and lies with- 
out any cultivation. The following rules, 
therefore, should be attended to for the 
improvement of knowledge. 1. Deeply 
possess your mmd with the vast im- 
portance of a good judgment, and the 
rich and inestimable advantage of right 
reasoning. — 2. Consider the weaknesses, 
failings, and mistakes of human nature 
in general. — 3. Be not satisfied with a 
slight view of things, but to take a wide 
survey now and then of the vast and un- 
limited regions of learwing, the varietv 
of questions and difficulties belonging to 
every science. — 4. Presume not too 
much upon a bright genius, a ready wit, 
and good parts ; for this, witho\it study, 
will never make a man of knowledge. — 
5. Do not imagine that large and labo- 
rious readirig, and a strong memory, 
can denominate you truly wise, without 
meditation and studious thought. — 6. Be 
not so weak as to imagine that a life of 
learning is a life of laziness. — 7. -Let the 
hope of new discoveries, as well as 
the satisfaction and pleasure of known 
truths, animate your daily industry. — 8. 
Do not hover always on the surface of 
things, nor take up suddenly with moe 
appearances. — 9. Once a day, especially 
in the early years of life and studv, call 
yourselves to an account what new ideas 
you have gained. — 10. Maintain a con- 
stant watch, at all times, against a dog- 
matical spirit. — 11. Be humble and cou- 
rageous enough to retract anv mistake, 



and confess an error. — 12. Beware of a 
fanciful temper of mind, and a humorous 
conduct. — 13. Have a care of trifling 
with things important and momentous, 
or of sporting with things awful and 
sacred. — 14. Ever maintain a virtuous 
and pious frame of spii-it. — 15. Watch 
against the pride of your own reason, 
and a vain conceit of your own intellec- 
tual powers, with the' neglect of divine 
aid and blessing. — 16. Offer up, there- 
fore, your daily requests to God, the 
Father of Lights, that he would bless 
all your attempts and labours in reading, 
study, and conversation. Watts on the

KNOW^LEDGE OF GOD is often 
taken for the fear of God and the whole 
of religion. There is, indeed, a specu- 
lative knowledge, which consists only in 
the belief of his existence, and the ac- 
knowledgment of his perfections, but 
has no influence on the heart and con- 
duct. A spiritual saving knowledge 
consists in veneration for the Divine 
Being, Psal. Ixxxix. 7. love to him a.s 
an object of beauty and goodness, Zech. 
ix. 17. humble confidence in his mercy 
and promise, Psal. ix. 10. and sincere, 
uniform, and persevering obedience to 
his word, 1 John ii. 3. It may farther be 
considered as a knowledge of God, the 
Father ; of his love, faithfulness, power, 
&amp;c. Of the Son, as it relates to the 
dignity of his nature, 1 John v. 20. the 
suitability of his offices, Heb. ix. the 
perfection of his work, Psalm Ixviii. 18. 
the brightness of his example. Acts x. 
38. and the prevalency of his interces- 
sion, Heb. vii. 25. Of the Holy Ghost, as 
equal with the Father and the Son ; of 
his agency as enlightener and comforter ; 
as also in his work of witnessing, sancti- 
fying, and directing his people, John xv, 
xvi. 2 Cor. iii. 17, 18. John iii. 5, 6. Rom. 
viii. 16. TTiis knowledge may be con- 
sidered as experimental, 2 Tim. i. 12, 
fiducial. Job xiii. 15, 16. affectionate, 1 
John iii. 19. influential, Ps. ix. 10. Matt. 
V. 16. humiliating, Isa. vi. Job xlii. 5, 6. 
satisfying, Psal. xxxvi. 7. Prov. iii. 17. 
and superior to all other knowledge, 
Phil. iii. 8. The advantages of religious 
knowledge are every way great. It 
forms the basis of tru«|hon'our and feli- 
city. '• Not all the lustre of a n(;ble 
birth, not all the influence of wealth, not 
all the pomp of titles, not all the splen- 
dour of power, can give dignity to the 
soul that is destitute of inward impTOve" 
ment. By this we are allied to angels,

and arc capable of ri'^iiip; for e^ er in the 
scale of being. Sik h is its inherent 
worth, that it hath always been repre- 
sented under the most pleasing images. 
In particular, it hath been compared to 
light, tlie most valuable and reviving 
part of nature's works, and to that glo- 
rious luminary which is the most beau- 
tiful and transporting object our eyes 
behold. If we entertain any doubts con- 
cerning the intrinsic value of religious 
knowleil-ge, let us look around us, and 
we shall be convinced how desirable it 
is to be acquainted with God, with 
spiritual, with eternal things. Observe 
the difference between a cultivated and 
a barren country. While the former is 
a lovely, cheerful, and delightful sight, 
the other administers a spectacle of 
horror. There is an equal difference be- 
tween the nations among whom the 
principles of piety prevail, and the na- 
tions tnat are o\'errun with idolatry, su- 
.perstition, and error. Knowledge, also, 
is of great imjDortance to our personal 
and private felicity : it furnishes a plea- 
sure that cannot be met with in the pos- 
session of inferior enjoyments ; a fine 
entertainment, which adds a relish to 
prosperit}', and alleviates the hour of 
distress. It throws a lustre upon great- 
ness, and reflects an honour upon pover- 
ty. Knowledge will also instruct us how 
to apply our several talents for the 
bcncht of mankind. It will make us ca- 

Sable of advising and regulating others, 
[ence we may become the lights of the 
world, and diffuse those beneficent beams 
around u.s, which shall shine on benight- 
ed travellers, and discover the path of 
rectitude and bliss. This knowledge, 
also, tends to destroy bigotry and en- 
thusiasm. To this we are indebted for 
the important change which hath been 
made since the beginning of the refor- 
mation. To this we are indebted for the 
general cultivation and refinement of the 
understandings of men. It is owing to 
this state that even arbitrary govern- 
ments seem to have lost something of 
their original ferocity, and that there is a 
source of improvement in Europe which 
will, we hope, in futui'e times, shed the 
inost delightful influences on society, 
and unite its members in harmony, 
peace, and love. But the advantages of 
knowledge are still gi-eater, for it points 
out to us an eternal felicity. The seve- 
ral branches ofwiuman science are in- 
tended only to bless and adorn our pre- 
sent existence ; but religious knowledge 
bids us provide for an immortal being, 
sets the path of salvation before us, and 
is our mseparable companion in the 
load to glorj\ As it instructs in the way 



to endless bliss, so it will survive that 
mighty day when all worldly literature 
and accomplishments shall for ever 
cease. At that solemn period, in which 
the records and registers of men shall 
be destroyed, the systems of human 
policy be dissolved, and the grandest 
works of genius die, the wisdom which 
is spiritual and heavenly shall not only 
subsist, but be increased to an extent 
that human nature cannot in this life ad- 
mit. Our views of things, at present, are 
obscure, imperfect, partial, and liable to 
eiTor ; but when we arrive to the realms 
of everlasting light, the clouds that 
shadowed our understanding will be 
removed ; Ave shall behold with amaz- 
ing clearness the attributes, ways, and 
works of God ; shall perceive more dis- 
tinctly the design of his dispensations ; 
shall trace with rapture the wonders of 
nature and grace, and become acquaint- 
ed with a thousand glorious objects, of 
which the imagination can as yet have 
no conception." 

In order to increase in the knowledge 
of God, there must be dependence on 
Him from whom all light proceeds,

KORAN, or Alcoran, the Scrip- 
ture or Bible of the Mahometans, con- 
taining the revelations and doctrines of 
their pretended prophet. 

1. Koran, d/vifiion of the. The' Ko- 
ran is divided into one liundred and four- 
teen larger portions of very unequal 
length, which we call chafiters, but the 
Arabians Sowar, in the singular Sura ; 
a word' rarely used on any other occa- 
sion, and properly signifying a row, or 
a regular series ; as a course of bricks 
in building, or a rank of soldiers in an 
army, and is the same in use and im- 
port with the Sura, or Tora, of the 
Jews ; who also call the fifty three sec- 
tions of the Pentateuch Sedarim, a word 
of the same signification. These chap- 
ters are not, in the manuscript copies, 
distinguished by their numerical order, 
but by particular titles, which are ta- 
ken sometimes from a peculiar subjec.

2f)l 



KOR 



treated of, or person mentioned therein ; 
usually from the first word of note, 
exactly in the same manner as the Jews 
have named their Sedarim ; thougli the 
word from- which some chapters are 
denominated be veiy distant towai'ds 
the middle, or perhaps' the end, of the 
chapter; which seems ridiculous. But 
the occasion of this appears to have 
been, that the verse or passage wherein 
such w^ord occurs, was, in point of time, 
revealed and committed to writing be- 
fore the other verses of the same chap- 
ter Avhich precede it in order ; and the 
title being to the chapter before it was 
completed, or the passages reduced to 
their present order, the verse from 
whence such title w^as taken did not 
always happen to begin the chapter. 
Some chapters have two or moi-e t]tles, 
occasioned by the difference of the co- 
pies. Some of them being pretended 
to have been revealed at Mecca, and 
others at Medina, the noting this dif- 
ference makes a part of the title. Every 
chapter is divided into smaller portions, 
of very unequal length also, which we 
customarily call veres; but the Ara- 
bic word is ^4yat, the same with the 
Hebrew Ototh, and signifies signs or 
wonders; such as the secrets of God, 
his attributes, works, judgments, and 
ordinances, delivered in tl\ose verses ; 
many of which have their particular 
titles, also, imposed in the same manner 
as those of ti^e chapters. Besides these 
unequal dh isions, the Mahometans 
have also divided their Koran into sixty 
equal portions, which they call Anzah, 
in the singular Hizb, each subdivided 
into four equal parts ; which is likewise 
an imitation of the Jews, who have 
an ancient division of their Mishna into 
sixty portions, called Massictoth. But 
the Koran is more usually divided into 
thirty sections only, named Ajaza, from 
the singular Joz, each of tv.'ice the 
length of the former, ajid in like man- 
ner subdivided into four parts. These 
divisions are for the use of the readers 
of the Koran in the royal temples, or in 
the adjoining chapels where the em- 
perors and great men are interred ; of 
whom there are thirty belonging to 
every chapel, and each" reads liis sec- 
tion every day ; so that the whole Koran 
is read over once a dav. Next after 
the title, at the name of every cliapter 
except only the ninth, is prefixed the 
following solemn form, by the Mahome- 
tans, called the Bismallah. — " In the 
name of the most merciful God ;" 
which form they constantly place at 
the beginning of all their books and 
v/ritings in general, as a peculiar mark | 



and distinguishing characteristic of their 
religion, it Ijeing counted a sort of im- 
piety to omit it. The Jews, and eastern 
Christians, for the same purpose, make 
use of similar forms. But Mahomet 
probably took this form from the Per- 
sian Magi, who began their books in 
tliese words, Benatn Yezdcim bak- 
sha'ishghcr dadar ; that is, In the name 
of the Dwst merciful jjist God. There 
are twenty-nine chapters of the Koran 
which have this peculiarity, that they 
begin with certahi letters of the alpha- 
bet, some with single ones, others with 
more. These letters the Mahometans 
believe to be the peculiar marks of the 
Koran, and to conceal several profound 
mysteries ; the certain understanding 
of which, the more intelligent confess, 
has not been communicated to any 
mortal, their prophet only excepted : 
notwithstanding which, some take the 
libertv of guessing at their meaning by 
that species of cabala called by the 
Jews A^o(ariko?i. 

2. Koran, general design of the. The 
general design of the Koran was to unite 
the professors of the three different re- 
ligions, then followed in the populous 
country of Arabia, (who, for the most 
part, wandered without guides, the far 
greater tiumbei" being idolaters, and the 
rest .Tews and Christians, mostly of er- 
roneous opinion,) in the knowledge and 
worship of one God, under the sanction 
of certain laws and ceremonies, partly 
of ancient, and partly of novel institu- 
tion, enforced by the consideration of 
rewards and punishments botii temporal 
and eternal ; and to bring them all to 
the obedience of Mahomet, as the pro- 
phet and ambassador of God ; who, 
after the repeated admonitions, pro- 
mises, and threats of former ages, was 
sent at last to establish and propagate 
God's religion on earth ; and to be ac- 
knowledged chief pontiff in spiritual 
matters, as well as supreme pnnce in 
tempoi-al. The gi-eat doctrine, then, 
of the Koran is the unity of God, to 
restore which, Mahomet pretended, 
was the chief -end of his mi.ssion; it 
being laid down by him as a fundamen- 
tal truth, That there never vfas, nor 
ever can be, more than one true ortho- 
dox religion: that, though tlie particu- 
lar laws or ceremonies are only tem- 
porary and subject to alteration, accord- 
ing to the divine direction ; yet the sub- 
stance of it, being eternal truth, is not 
liable to change, but continues immuta- 
bly the same ; and that, whenever this 
religion became neglected or corrupted 
in essentials, God had the goodness to 
re-infoi-m and re-admonish mankind

thereof by several ^jrophets, of whom" 
Moses and Jesus were the most distin- 
guished, till the appearance of Ma- 
homet, who is their seal, and no other 
to be expected after him. The more 
effectually to engage people to hearken 
to him, great part of the Koran is em- 
ployed in relating examples of dread- 
lul punishments formerly inflicted by 
God on those who rejected and abused 
his messengers; several of which stories, 
or some cii'cumstances of them, are ta- 
ken from the Old and New Testaments, 
but many more from the apocryphal 
books and traditions of the Jews and 
Christians of those ages, set up in the 
Koran as truths, in opposition to the 
Scriptures, which tiie Jews and Chris- 
tians are charged with having altered ; 
and, indeed, few or none of the relations 
of circumstances in the Koran were in- 
vented by Mahomet, as is generally 
supposed; it being easy to trace the 
greatest part of them much higher, as 
the rest might be, were more of these 
books extant, and were it worth while 
to make the inquiry. The rest of the 
Alcoran is taken up in prescribing ne- 
cessary laws and directions, frequent 
admonitions to moral and divine virtues, 
the worship and rcvei'cnce of the Su- 
preme Being, and resignation to his 
will. One of their most learned com- 
mentators distinguishes the contents of 
the Alcoran into allegorical and literal : 
under the foi'mer are corrprehended all 
the obscure, p;u-abolical, and enigmati- 
cal passages, with such lav/s as are re- 
pealed or abrogated ; the latter, such as 
are clear, and in full force. The most 
excellent moral in the whole Alcoran, 
inteipreters say, is that in the chapter 
Al alraf, viz. " Show mercy, do good to 
all, and dispute not with the ignorant ;" 
or, as Mr. Sale renders it, Use indul- 
gence, command that which is just, and 
withdraw far from the ignorant. Ma- 
liomet, according to the authors of the 
Keschaf, having begged of the angel 
Gabriel a more ample explication of 
this passage, received it in the follow- 
ing terms : " Seek him who turns thee 
out, give to him who takes from thee, 
pardon him who injures thee ; for God 
will have you plant in your souls the 
roots of his chief perfections." It is 
easy to see that this commentarv is 
borrowed from the Gospel. In reality, 
the necessity of forgiving enemies, 
though frequently inculcated in the Al- 
coran, is of a later date among the Ma- 
hometans, than among the Christians ; 
among those later than among the 
heathens ; and to be traced originally 
aniong the Jews, (See Exodus, xxxiii. 



4, 5.) But it matters not so much who 
had it first as who olDserves it best. 
The caliph Hassan, son of Hali, being 
at table, a slave let fall a dish of moat 
reeking hot, which scalded him severe- 
ly. The slave feU on his knees, rehears- 
ing these words of the Alcoran ; " Para- 
dise is for those who restrain their an- 
ger." " I am not angry with thee," 
answered the caliph. " And for those 
who forgive offences against them," 
continues the slave, " I forgive thee 
thine," replies the caliph. " But, above 
all, for those who return good for evil," 
adds the slave. " I set thee at liberty," 
rejoined the caliph ; " and I give thee 
ten dinars." There are also a great 
number of occasional passages in the 
Alcoran relating onfy to particular 
emergencies. For this advantage Ma- 
homet had, by his piecemeal method 
of receiving and delivering his revela- 
tions, that, whenever he happened to 
be perplexed with any thing, he had a 
certain resoui'ce in some new morsel of 
revelation. It was an admirable con- 
trivance to bring down the whole Al- 
coran only to the lowest heaven, not to 
earth ; since, had the whole been pub- 
lished at once, innumerable objections 
would have been nmde, which it would 
have been impossible for him to have 
solved ; but as he received it by parcels, 
as God saw fit they should be published 
for the conversion and instniction of 
the people, he had a suf^way to an- 
swer all emergencies, and to extricate 
himself with honour from any difficulty 
which might occur. 

3. Koran, histoinj of the. It is the 
common opinion, that Mahomet, as- 
sisted by one Sergius, a monk, compo- 
sed this book ; but the Mussulmans be- 
lieve it as an article of their faith, that 
the prophet, who, they say, was an 
illiterate man, had no concern in indi- 
ting it ; but that it was given him by 
God, who, to that end, made use of the 
ministry of the angel Gabriel ; that, 
howevei', it was communicated to him 
by little and little, a verse at a time, 
and in different places, during the course 
of 23 years. — "And hence," say they, 
" proceed that disorder and confusion 
visible in the work ;" which, in trutli, 
arc so great, that all their doctors lun'c 
never been able to adjust them ; for 
Mahomet, or rather his copyist, having 
put all the loose verses promiscuously 
in a book together, it was impossible 
ever to retrieve the order wherein they 
were delivered. These 23 years which 
the angel employed in conveying the 
Alcoran to Mahomet, are of wonderful 
service to his followers; inasmuch as

thcv furnish them with an answer to 
such as tax them with tliose glaring 
contradictious of which the hook is full, 
and which they piously father upon God 
himself; alleging that, in the course of 
so long a time, he repealed and altered 
several doctrines and precepts which 
the prophet had before received of him. 
M. D'Herbelot thinks it probable, that 
■when the heresies of 'the Nestorians, 
Eutychians, 8cc. had been condemned 
by (Ecumenical councils, many bishops, 
priests, monks, &amp;c. being driven into 
the deserts of Arabia and Egypt, fur- 
nished the impostor with passages, and 
cinide ill-conceived doctrines, out of the 
Scriptures ; and that it was hence that 
the Alcoran became so full of the wild 
and erroneous opinions of those here- 
tics. The Jews also, who were very 
numerous in Arabia, furnished mate- 
rials, for the Alcoran ; nor is it without 
some reason that they boast twelve of 
their chief doctors to have been the 
authors of this work. The Alcoran, 
while Mahomet lived, was only kept in 
loose sheets : his successor, Abvibeker, 
iirst collected them into a volume, and 
committed the keeping of it to Haphsa, 
the widow of Mahomet, in order to be 
consulted as an original ; and tb.ere be- 
ing a good deal of diversity between 
the several copies already dispersed 
throughout the provinces, Ottoman, 
successor of Abubeker, procured a 
great nuinber of copies to be taken from 
that of Haphsa, at the same time sup- 
pressing all the others not conformable 
to the original. The chief differences 
in the present copies of this book con- 
sist in the points, which were not in use 
in the time of Mahomet and his imme- 
diate successors ; but were added since, 
to ascertain the reading, after the ex- 
ample of the Massoretes, who added 
the like points to the Hebrew texts of 
Scripture. There are seven principal 
editions of the Alcoran, two at Medina, 
one at Mecca, one at Cufa, one at Bas- 
sora, one in Syria, and the common, or 
vulgate edition. The first contains 6000 
verses, the others surpassing this num- 
ber by 200 or 236 verses ; but the num- 
ber of woi-ds and letters is the same in 
all; viz. 77,639 words, and 323,015 
letters. The number of commentaries 
on the Alcoran is so large^ that the 
bare titles would make a huge volume. 
Ben Oschair has wi-itten the history of 
them, entitled, Tarikh Ben Oschair. 
The principal among them are, Reid- 
liaori, Thaalebi, Zamalchschari, and 
Bacai. The Mahometans have a posi- 
tive theology built on the Alcoran and 
tradition, as well as a scholastical one 



built on reason. They have likewise 
their casuists, and a kind of canon law, 
wherein they distinguish between what 
is of divine and what of positive right 
They have their- beneficiaries, too, 
chaplains, almoners, and canons, who 
read a cha]&gt;ter CA'erj' day out of the 
Alcoran in their mosques, and have pre- 
bends annexed to their ofiice. The ha- 
tib of the mosque is what we call the 
■parson of the parish; and the scheiks are 
the preachers, who take their texts out 
of the Alcoran. 

4. Koran, Mahometan ^aith concern- 
in!^'. It is the general belief among the 
Mahometans that the Koran is of divine 
original ; nay, that it is eternal and un- 
created ; remaining, as some express 
it, in the very essence of God : and the 
first transcript has been from ever- 
lasting, bv God's throne, Avritten on a 
table of "vast bigness, called the prt- 
served table, in which are also recorded 
the divine decrees, past and future ; 
that a copy from this table, in one vo- 
lume upon paper, was by the ministiy 
of the angel Gabriel sent down to the 
lowest heaven, in the month of Rama- 
dan, on the night o{ ponvcr, from whence 
Gabriel revealed it to Mahomet in par- 
cels, some at Mecca, and some at Me- 
dina, at different times, during the space 
of twenty-three years, as the exigency 
of affaii's required; giving him, however, 
the consolation to show him the whole 
(whicli they tell us was bound in silk, 
and adoi'ued with gold and precious 
stones of paradise) once a year ; but in 
the last year of his life he had the fa- 
vour to see it twice. They say, that 
only ten chapters were deli\'ercd entire, 
the rest being revealed piecemeal, and 
written down from time to time by the 
prophet's amanuensis, in such a part of 
such and such a chapter, till they were 
completed, according to the directions 
of the angel. The first parcel that ■(\'as 
revealed is generally agreed to have 
been the first five verses of the ninety- 
sixth chapter. In fine, the book of the 
Alcoran is held in the highest esteem 
and reverence among the Mussulmans. 
They dare not so much as touch the 
Alcoran without being first washed, or 
legally purified ; to prevent which an 
insci'iption is put on the co\er or label, 
— Let none touch hut they ivho are clear: . 
It is read with great care and respect, 
being never held below the girdle. 
They swear by it; take omens from_ it 
on all weighty occasions ; carry it with 
them to war; write sentences of it on 
their banners ; adorn it with gold and 
precious stones ; and knowingly not 
suffer it to be in the possession of any

of a different religion. Some say that 
it is punishable even witli death, in a 
Christian, to touch it ; otliers, that 
the veneration of the Mussulmans 
leads tliem to condemn the translating 
it into any other language, as a profa- 
nation : but these seem to be exagge- 
rations. The Mahometans have taken 
care to have their Scripture transla- 
ted into the Persian, the Javan, the 
Malayan, and other languages ; though, 
out of respect to the original, these ver- 
sions are generally, if not always, inter- 
lineated. 

5. Koran, success of the, accowitecl 
for. The author of the "View of 
Christianity and Mahometanism" ob- 
serves, that, " by the advocates of Ma- 
hometanism, the Koran has always been 
held forth as the greatest of miracles, 
and equally stupendous with the act of 
raising the dead. The miracles of Mo- 
ses and Jesus, they say, wei-e transient 
and temporary ; but that of the Koran is 
permanent and perpetual, and therefore 
far surpassed all the mii'aculous events 
of pi'ereding ages. We will not detract 
from the real merits of the Koran; we 
allow it to be generally elegant and 
often sublime ; but at the same time 
we reject with disdain its arrogant pre- 
tence to any thing su])ernatural, all tlie 
real excellence ot the work being easily 
"'eferaijle to natural and visible causes. 
In the lang-uage of Arabia, a language 
extremely loved and diligently cultiva- 
ted by the peoi&gt;le to whom it was ver- 
nacular, Mahomet found advantages 
which were never enjoyed l)y any for- 
mer or succeeding impostor. It requires 
not the eye of a philosopher to discover 
in every soil and country a principle of 
national pride ; and if we look back for 
many ages on the history of the Ara- 
bians, we shall easily perceive that pride 
among them invariably to ha\'e consist- 
ed in the knowledge and improvement 
of their native language. The Arabic, 
which has been justly esteemed the 
most copious of the eastern tongues, 
which had existed from the remotest 
antiquity, which had been eml)ellished 
by numberless poets, and refined bv the 
constant exercise of tlie natives, was the 
most successful instrument whicli Ma- 
homet employed in planting his new re- 
ligion among them. Admirably adapted 
by its um-ivalled harmony, and by its 
endless variety, to add painting to' ex- 
pression, and to pursue the imagination 
m its unbounded flight, it became in the 
hands of Mahomet an irresistiole charm 
to blind the judgment and to captivate 
the fancy of his followers. Of that de- 
scription of men who first composed 



the adherents of Mahomet, and to 
whom the Koran was addressed, few, 
probably, were able to pass a very ac- 
curate judgment on the propriety of the 
sentiments, or on the beauty of the dic- 
tion : but all could judge of the military 
abilities of their leader ; and in the 
midst of their admiration, it is not diffi- 
cult to conceive that they would ascribe 
to his compositions every imaginary 
beauty of inspired language. The shep- 
herd and the soldier, though awake to 
the charms of those wild but beautiful 
compositions in which were celebrated 
their favourite occupations of lo\e or 
war, were yet little able to criticise any 
other works than those which were ad- 
dressed to their imagination or their 
heart. To abstract reasonings on the 
attributes and the dispensations of the 
Deitv, to the comparative excellencies 
of rival religions, to the consistency of 
any one religious system in all its parts, 
and to the force of its various proofs, 
they were quite inattentive. In such a 
situation, the appearance of a work 
which possessed something like wisdom 
and consistence ; which prescribed the 
rules and illustrated the duties of life ; 
and which contained the principles of a 
new and comparatively sublime theo- 
logy, independently of its real and per- 
manent merit, was likely to excite their 
astonishment, and to become the stan- 
dard of future composition. In the first 
periods of the literature of every coun- 
try, something of this kind has happen- 
ed. The father of Grecian poetry very 
obviously influenced the taste and imi- 
tation of his country. The modern na- 
tions of Europe all possess some original 
author, who, rising from the darkness 
of former ages, has begun the career of 
composition, and tinctured witli the 
character of his own imagination the 
stream which has flowed through his 
posterity. But the prophet of Arabia 
had in this res]iect advantages peculiar 
to himself. His compositions were not 
to his followers the works of man, but 
the genuine language of Heaven which 
had sent him. They were not confined, 
therefore, to that admiration which is 
so liberally bestowed on the earliest 
productions of genius, or to that fond at- 
tachment with which men every where 
regard the original compositions of their 
countiy ; but with their admiration 
they blended their piety. To know and 
to feel the beauties of the Koran, was 
in some respect to share in the temper 
of heaven ; and he who was most affect- 
ed with admiration in the perusal of its 
beauties, seemed fitly the object of that 
mercy which had given it to ignorant

KOR 



man. The Koran, therefore, became 
naturally and necessarily the standard 
of taste. With a language thus hallov/- 
cd in their imaginations, they were too 
well satisfied either to dispute its ele- 
gance, or improve its structure. In suc- 
ceeding ages, the additional sanction of 
antiquity or prescription, was given to 
those compositions which their fathers 
had admired; and while the belief of 
its divine original continues, that admi- 
i-ation which has thus become the test 
and the duty of the faithful, can neither 
be altered nor diminished, \\n\en, there- 
fore, we consider these 'peculiar advan- 
tages of the Koran, we have no reason 
to be surprised at the admiration in 
which it is held. But, if descending to 
a more minute investigation of it, we 
consider its perpetual inconsistence and 
absurdity, we shall indeed have cause 
for astonishment at that weakness of 
hiunanity, which could ever have re- 
ceived such compositions as the work 
of the Deity." 

6. Koran, style and merits of the, 
examined. " The first praise of all the 
productions of genius (continues this 
author) is invention ; that quality of the 
mind, which, by the extent and quick- 
ness of its views, is capable of the 
lai'gest conceptions, and ot forming new 
combinations of ol)jects the most distant 
and luiusual. But the Koran bears lit- 
tle impression of this transcendant cha- 
racter. Its materials are wholly bor- 
rowed from the Jewish and Christian 
Scriptures, from tlie Talmudical le- 
gends and apocryphal gospels then cur- 
rent in the east, and from the traditions 
and fables which abounded in Arabia. 
Tlie materials collected from these se- 
veral sources are here heaped together 
with perpetual and heedless repetitions, 
without any settled principle or visible 
connection. When a gi'eat part of the 
life of Mahomet had been spent in pre- 
paratoiy meditation on the system he 
was about to establish, its chapters were 
dealt out slowly and separately during 
the long period of twenty-three years. 
Yet, thus defective in its structure, and 
no less objectionable in its doctrines, was 
the work which Mahomet delivered to 
his followers as the oracles of God. 
The most prominent feature of the Ko- 
ran, that point of excellence in which 
the partiality of its admirers has ever 
delighted to view it, is the sublime no- 
tion it generally impresses of the nature 
and attributes of God. If its author had 
really derived these just conceptions 
from the inspiration of that Being whom 
they attempt to describe, they would 
not have been surrounded, as they now 



are on %vcry side, with eiTov and ab- 
surdity. But it might be easily proved, 
that whatever it justly defines of the 
divine attributes was borrowed from our 
Holy Scripture ; which even from its 
first promulgation, but especially from 
the completion of the New Testament, 
has extended the views and enlightened 
the understandings of mankind : and 
tlnis furnished them with arms which 
have too often been effectvially tui-ned 
against itself by its ungenerous enemies. 
In this instance, particularly, the copy 
is far below the great original, both in 
the propriety of its images aiid the 
force of its descriptions." 

7. Koran, the sublimity of the, con- 
trasted. " Our Holy Scriptures are the 
only compositions that can enable the 
dim sight of mortality to penetrate into 
the invisible world, and to behold a 
glimpse of the divine perfections. Ac- 
cordingly, when they would represent 
to us the happiness of heaven, they de- 
scribe it, not by any thing minute and 
particular, but by something general 
and great; something that, without de- 
scending to any determinate object, may 
at once by its beauty and immensity- 
excite our wishes, and elevate our af- 
fections. Though in the prophetical 
and evangelical writings, the joys that 
shall attend us in a divine state, are of- 
ten mentioned with ardent admiration, 
they arc expressed ratlier by allusion 
than by similitude ; rather by indefinite 
and figurative terms, than by any thing 
fixed and determinate. ' E}e hath not 
seen, nor ear heard, neither have en- 
tered into the heait of man the things 
which God hath prepared for them that 
love him,' 1 Cor. ii. 9. • What a reve- 
rence and astonishment does this pas- 
sage excite in every hearer of taste and 
piety ! What energy, and at the same 
time what simplicity in the expression I 
How sublime, and at the same time 
how obscure, is the imagery ! iJifFerent; 
was the concluct of Mahomet in his de- 
scriptions of heaven and paradis^. Un- 
assisted bj the necessary influence of 
virtuous nitentions and divine inspira- 
tion, he was neither desirous, nor indeed 
able to exalt the minds of men to sub- 
lime conceptions, or to rational expec- 
tations. By attempting to explain what 
is inconceivable, to describe what is in- 
effable, and to materialize. what in it- 
self is spiritual, he absurdly and im- 
piously aimed to sensualize the purity 
of the" divine essence. Thus he fabri- 
cated a system of incoherence, a reli- 
gion of depra-vity, totally repugnant to 
the nature of that Being, who, as he 
pretended, vvas its object ; but therefor'.

more likely to accord with tli^ appe- 
tites and conceptions of a corrupt and 
sensual age. That we may not appear 
to exalt our Sci'iptures thus far abo\'e 
the Koran by an unreasonable prefer- 
ence, we shall produce a part of the 
second chapter of the latter, which is 
deservedly admired by the Mahome- 
tans, who wear it engraved on their or- 
naments, and recite it in their prayers. 
' God I there is no God but he ; the liv- 
ing, the self-subsisting ; neither slumber 
nor sleep seizeth him : to him belongeth 
whatsoever is in heaven, and on earth. 
Who is he that can intercede with him 
but through his good pleasure.-' He 
knoweth that which is past, and that 
w liich is to come. His throne is extend- 
ed over heaven and earth, and the pre- 
servation.of both is to, him no burden. 
He is the high, the mighty.' Sale's 
Koran, vol. ii. p. 30. To this description 
who can refuse the praise of magnifi- 
cence ? Part of that magnificence, how- 
ever, is to be referred to that verse of 
the psalmist v.'hence it was borrowed : 
• He that keepeth Israel shall neither 
slumber nor .sleep,' Psal. cxxi. 4. But 
if we compare it with that other pas- 
sage of the inspired psalmist, (Psal. cii. 
24 — 27.) all its boasted grandeur is at 
once obscured, and lost in the blaze of a 



greater light ' ' O, my God, take me not 
away in the midst of my days; thy years 
are throughout all generations. Of old 
hast thou laid the foundation of the 
earth ; and the heavens ai-e the work of 
thy hands. They shall perish, but thou 
shalt endure ; j'ca, all of them shall wax 
old like a garment ; as a vesture shalt 
thou change them, and they shall be 
changed. But thou art the same, and 
thy years sliall have no end.' The Ko- 
ran, therefore, upon a fair examination, 
far from supporting its arroga,nt claim 
to a supernatural work, sinks below the 
level of many compositions confessedly 
of human original; and still lower does 
it fall in our estimation, when compared 
with that pure and perfect pattern 
which we justly admire m the Scriptures 
of truth. It is, therefore, abundantly 
apparent, that no miracle was either 
externally performed for the support, 
or is internally involved in the composi- 
tion of the Mahometan revelation." See

KTISTOLATR.E, a branch of the 
Monophysites, which maintained that 
the body of Christ before his resurrec- 
tion was corruptible. 



LABADISTS were so called from 
their founder, John Labadie, a native of 
France. He was originally in the Ro- 
mish communion ; but leaving that, he 
became a member of the reformed 
church, and performed with reputation 
the ministerial functions in France, 
Switzerland, and Holland. He at length 
erected a new community, which resid- 
ed successively at Middleburg, in Zea- 
land, Amsterdam, Hervorden, and at 
Altona. where he died about 1674. Af- 
ter his death, his followers removed 
their wandering community to Wiewert, 
in the district of North Holland, where 
it soon fell into obli^'ion. If we are to 
judge of the Labadists by their own ac- 
count, they did not differ from the re- 
formed church so much in their tenets 
and doctrines as bi their manners and 
lilies of discipline ; yet it seems that La- 
badie had some strange notions. Among 
other things, he maintained that God 
might and did, on certain occasions, de- 
cei\e men; that the faithful ought to 
have all things in common ; that there 



is no subordination or distinction of rank 
in the true church ; that in reading the 
Scrijjtures greater attention should be 
paid to the internal inspiration of the 
Holy Spirit than to the words of the 
text ; that the obsen'ation of Sunday 
was a matter of indifference ; that the 
contem])lative life is a state of grace and 
union with God, and the very height of 
perfection. 

LAITY, the people as distinguished 
from the clergy. See Clergy. 

LAMA, GRAND, a name given to 
the sovereign pontiff or high priest of 
the Thibetian Tartars, who resides at 
Patoli, a vast palace on a mountain near, 
the banks of Barampooter, about seven 
miles from Lahassa. The foot of this 
mountain is inhabited by twenty thousand 
lamas, or priests, who have their sepa- 
rate apartments round about the moun- 
tain, arid according to their respective 
quality are placed nearer or at a great- 
er distance, from the -sovereign pontiff. 
He is not only worshipped by the Thi- 
hetians, hut also is the great object of 



LAIN! 



297 



LAM 



adoration for the various tribes of hea- 
then Tartars who roam through the 
vast tract of continent which stretches 
from the banks of the Wolga to Correa, 
on the sea of Japan. He is not only the 
soA'ereign pontiff, the vicegerent of the 
Deity on earth, but the more remote 
Tartars are said to absokUely regard 
him as the Deity himself, and call him 
God, the everlasting- Father of heaven. 
They believe him to Ije immoital, and 
endowed with all knowledge and virtue. 
Every year they come up from different 
parts to worship, and make rich offer- 
mgs at his shrine : even the emperor of 
China, who is a manchon Tartar, does 
not fail in acknowledgments to him in 
his religious capacity ; and actually en- 
teitains at a great expense, in the palace 
of Pekin, an inferior lama, deputed as 
his nuncio from Thibet. The grand 
lama, it has been said, is never to be 
seen but in a secret place of his palace, 
amidst a great number of lamps, sitting 
cross-legged on a cushion, and decked 
all over with gold and precious stones, 
where at a distance the people prostrate 
themselves before him, it not being law- 
ful for any, so much as to kiss his feet. 
He returns not the least sign of respect, 
nor ever speaks even to the greatest 
princes; but only lays his hand upon 
their heads, and they are fully per- 
suaded they receive from thence a full 
forgiveness of all their sins. 

The Sunniasses, or Indian pilgrims, 
often visit Thibet as a holy place ; and 
the lama always entertains a body of 
two or three hundred in his pay. Be- 
sides his religious influence and autho- 
rity, the grand lama is possessed of un- 
limited power throughout his dominions, 
which are very extensive. The inferior 
lamasjjpte form the most numerous as 
well as the most powerful body in the 
state, have the priesthood entirely in 
their hands; and besides fill up many 
monastic orders which are held in great 
veneration among them. The whole 
country, like Italy, abounds with jjriests ; 
and they entirely subsist on the great 
number of rich presents which are sent 
them from the utmost extent of Tartary, 
from the empire of the Great Mogul, 
and from almost all parts of ihe. Indies. 

The opinion of those who are reputed 
the most orthodox among the Thibetians 
is, that Avhen the grand lama seems to 
die, either of old age or infirmity, his 
soul, in fact, only quits a crazy habita- 
tion to look for another younger or bet- 
ter ; and is discovered again in the body 
of some child by certain tokens, known 
only to the lamas or priests, in which 
order he always appears. 



Almost all nations of the east, except 
the Mahometans, belie^■e the metem/i- 
sychosis as the' most important article 
of their faith ; especially the inhabitants 
of Thibet and Ava, the Peguans, Siam- 
ese, the greatest part of the Chinese 
and Japanese, and the Monguls and 
Kalmucks, who changed the religion of 
Schamanism for the worship of the 
grand lama. According to the docti-ine 
of this metei}i/isychosis,the soul is always 
in action, and never at rest ; for no 
sooner does she leave her old habita- 
tion, than she enters a new one. The 
dalai lama, being a divine person, caix 
find no better lodging than the body of 
his successor ; or the Foe, residing in the 
dalai lama, which passes to his succes- 
sor : and this being a god, to whom all 
things are known, the dalai lama is 
therefore acquainted Avith every thing 
which happened dui-ing his residence in 
his former body. 

This religion is said to have been of 
three thousand years standing ; and 
neither time nor the influence of men, 
has had the power of shaking the au- 
thority of the grand lama. This theo- 
cracy extends as fully to tempoj-al as to 
spiritual concerns. 

Though in the grand sovereignty of 
the lamas, the temporal power has been 
occasionally separated from the spii-i- 
tual by slight revolutions, they have al- 
ways been united again after a time ; 
so that in Thibet the whole constiflitioii 
rests on the imperial pontificate in a 
manner elsewhere unknown. For as the 
Thibetians suppose that the grand lama 
is animated by the god Shaka, or Foe, 
j who at the decease of one lama trans- 
I migrates into the next, and consecrates 
him an image of the divinity, the de- 
scending chain of lamas is continued 
down from him in fixed degrees of sanc- 
tity ; so that a more firmly established 
sacerdotal government, in doctrine, cus- 
toms, and institutions, than actually 
reigns over this countiy, cannot be con- 
ceived. The supreme manager of tern- 
poi'al affairs is no more than the viceroy 
of the sovereign priest, wlio, conforma- 
ble to the dictates of his religion, dwells 
in divine tranquillity in a'building that 
is both temple and palace. If some of 
his votaries in modem times h-ave dis- 
pensed with the adoration of his person, 
still certain real modifications of the 
Shaka religion is the only faitli they fol- 
low. The state of sanctity which that 
religion inculcates, consists in monastic 
continence, absence of thouglit, and the 
perfect repose of nonentity. 

It has been observed that the religion 
of Thibet is the counterpart of the Rot,

man Catholic, since the inhabitants of 
that country use holy water and a sing- 
mg service; they also offer alms, pray- 
ers, and sacrifices for the dead. They 
have a vast number of convents filled 
■with monks and friars, amounting to 
thirty thousand ; who, besides the three 
vows of poverty, obedience, and charity, 
make several others. They have their 
confessors, who are chosen by their su- 

f)eriors, and have licences from their 
amas, without which they cannot hear 
confessions or impose penances. They 
make use of beads. They wear the 
mitre and cap like the bishops : and 
their dalai lama is nearly the same 
among them as the sovereign pontiff is 
among the Romanists. 
LAMBETH ARTICLES. See Ar- 

LAMPETIANS, a denomination in 
the seventeenth centuiy, the followers 
of Lampetius, a Syrian monk. He pre- 
tended that as man is born free, a Chris- 
tian, in order to please God, ought to 
do nothing by necessity ; and that it is, 
therefore, unlawful to make vows, even 
those of obedience. To this system he 
added the doctrines of the Arians, Car- 
pocratians, and other denominations. 

LANGUAGE, in general, denotes 
those articulate sounds bv which men 
express their thoughts. Much has been 
said respecting the invention of lan- 
guage. • On the one side it is observed, 
that it is altogether a human invention, 
and that the progress of the mind, in 
the invention and improvement of lan- 
guage, is, by certain natural gradations, 
plainly discernible in the composition of 
words. But on the other side it is al- 
leged, that Ave are indebted to divine 
revelation for the origin of it. Without 
supposing this, we see not how our first 
parents could so early hold converse 
wich God, or the man with his wife. 
Admitting, however, that it is of divine 
original, we cannot suppose that a pei-- 
fect system of it was all at once given 
to man. It is much more natural to 
think that God taught our first parents 
only such language as suited their pre- 
sent occasion, leaving them, as he did 
in other things, to enlarge and improve 
it, as their future necessities should re- 
quire. Without attempting, however, 
to decide this controversy, we may con- 
sider language as one of the greatest 
blessings belonging to mankind. Desti- 
tute of this we should make but small 
advancements in science, be lost to all 
social enjoyments, and religion itself 
would feel the want of such a power. 
Our wise Creator, therefore, has con- 
fei'red upon us this inestimable privi- 



lege : let us then be cautious that our 
tongues be not the vehicle of vain and 
useless matter, but used for the great 
end of glorifving him, and doing good to 
mankind. What was the first language 
taught man, is matter of dispute among 
the learned, but most, think it was the 
Hebrew. But as this subject, and the 
article in general, belongs more to phi- 
lology than divinity, we refer the reader 
to Dr. Adam S?nith's Dissertation on 
the Formation of Languages ; Harris's

LATITUDINARIAN, a person not 
conforming to any particular opinion or 
standard, but of such moderation as to 
suppose that people will be admitted 
into heaven, although of different per- 
suasions. The term was more especially 
applied to those pacific doctors in the 
seventeenth centuiy, who offered them- 
selves as mediators between the more 
violent Episcopalians, and the rigid 
Presbyterians and Independents, re- 
specting the forms of church govern- 
ment, public worship, and certain reli- 
gious tenets, more especially those that 
were debated between the Arminians 
and Calvinists. The chief leaders of 
these Latitudinarians were Hales and 
Chillingworth ; but More, Cudworth, 
Gale, Witchcot, and Tillotson, were 
also among the number. These men, 
although fiiTnly attached to the church 
of England, did not go so far as to look 
upon it as of divine institution ; and 
hence they maintained, that Ihose who 
followed other forms of govelHBent and 
worship, were not on that account to be 
excluded from their communion. As to 
the doctrinal part of religion, they took 
the system of Episcopius for their mo- 
del, and, like him, reduced the funda- 
mental doctrines of Christianity to a 
few points ; and by this manner of pro- 
ceeding they endeavoured to show the 
contending pai'ties, that they had no 
reason to oppose each other with such 
animosity and bitterness, .since the sub- 
jects of their debates were matters of an 
indifferent nature with respect to salva- 
tion. They met, howe\"er, with oppo- 
sition for their pains, and Avere branded 
as Atheists and Deists by some, and as 
Socinians by others ; but upon the re- 
storation of Charles II. they were raised 
to the first dignities of the church, and 
were held in considerable esteem. See

vol. ii. p. 501. quarto edit. 

LAURA, in church history, a name 
given to a collection of little cells at 
some distance from each other, in which 
the hermits of ancient times lived to- 
gether in a wilderness. • These hermits 
did not live in confm unity, but each monk 
provided for himself in his distinct cell. 
The most celebrated lauras mentioned 
in ecclesiastical history were in Pales- 
tine ; as the laura of St. Euthynuis, St. 
Saba, the laura of the towers, &amp;c. 

LAW, a I'ule of action ; a precept or 
command coming from a superior au- 
thority, which an inferior is bound to 
obey. Tlie manner in wliich God go- 
verns rational creatures is by a law, as 
the rale of their obedience to him, and 
which is what we call God's moral go- 
vernment of the world. He gave a law 
to angels, which some of them kept, and 
have been confirmed in a state of obe- 
dience to it ; but which others broke, 
and thereby plunged themselves into 
destruction and misery. He gave, also, 
a law to Adam, and which was in tlie 
form of a co^'enant, and in which Adam 
stood as a covenant head to all his pos- 
terity, Rom. V. Gen. ii. But our first 
parents soon violated that law, and fell 
from a state of innocence to a state of sin 
and misery, Hos. vi. 7. Gen. iii. See Fall. 

Positive laws, are precepts which are 
not founded upon any reasons known to 
those to whom they are given. Thus in 
the state of innocence God gave the law 
of the Sabbath ; of abstinence from the 
fruit of the tree of knowledge, &amp;c. 

Z,aw of nature is the will of God re- 
lating to human actions, grounded in tlie. 
moral differences of things, and, because 
discoverable by natural light, oljligatory 
upon all mankind, Rom. i. 20. ii. 14, 15. 
This law is coeval with the human race, 
binding all over the globe, and at all 
times; yet, through the corruption of 
reason, it is insufficient to lead us to hap- 

Siness, and utterly unable to acquaint us 
ow sin is to be forgiven, without the 
assistance of revelation. 

Ceremonial law is that which pre- 
scribed the rites of worship used under 
the Old Testament. These rites were 
typical of Christ, and were obligatory 
only till Christ had finished his work, 
and began to erect his Gospel churcli, 
Heb. vii. 9, 11. Heb. x. 1. Eph. ii. 16. 
Col. ii. 14. Gal. v. 2, 3. 

Judicial law was that which directed 
the policy of the Jewish nation, as under 
the peculiar dominion of God as their 
Supi-eme magistrate, and never, except 
in things relative to moral equity, Avas 
binding on any but the Hebrew nation. 



Moral law is that declaration of Ciod's 
will which directs and binds all men, in 
eveiy age and place, to their whole duty 
to him. It was most solemnly proclaim- 
ed by God himself at Sinai, to confirm 
the original law of nature, and correct 
men's mistakes concemhigthe demands 
of it. It is denominated Jierfect, Psal. 
xix. 7. perfietual, Matt. v. 17, 18. holy, 
Rom. vii. 12. good, Rom. vii. 12. sfiiri- 
tiial, Rom. vii. 14. exceeding broad, 
Psal. cxix. 96. Some deny tliat it is a 
rule of conduct to believers under the 
Gospel dispensation ; but it is easy to 
see the futility of such an idea ; for as a 
transcript of the mind of God, it must be 
the criterion of moral good and evil. It 
is also given foi- that very purpose, that 
we may see our duty, and abstain from 
every thing derogatory to the div'uie 
glory. It affords us grand ideas of the 
holiness and purity of God : without at- 
tention to it, we can have no knowledge 
of sin. Christ himself came not to de- 
stroy, but to fulfil it; and though we 
cannot do as he did, yet we are com- 
manded to follow his example. Love to 
God is the end of the moral law, as 
well as the end of the Gospel. By the 
law, also, we are led to see the natui'e 
of holiness, and our own dejiravity, and 
learn to be humbled under a sense of 
our impei'fection. We are not under it, 
however, as a covenant of works. Gal, 
iii. 13. or as a source of terror, Rom. 
viii. 1. although we must abide by it, to- 
gether with the whole ]:)i-ece]:)tive word 
of God, as the rule of our conduct, Rom. 
iii. 31. vii. 

Laws, directive, are laws without any 
punishment annexed to them. 

Laws, penal, such as have some pe- 
nalty to enforce them. All the laws of 
God are and cannot but be penal, be- 
cause every breach of his law is sin, and 
meritorious of punishment. 

Law of honour is a system of rules 
constructed by people of fashion, and 
calculated to facilitate their intercourse 
with one another, and for no other pur- 
pose. Consequently nothing is adverted 
to by the law of honour but what tend,s 
to incommode this intercourse. Hence 
this law only prescribes and regulates 
the duties betwixt equals, omitting 
such as relate to the Supreme Being, as 
well as those which we owe to our m- 
feriors. 

In fact, this law of honour, in most 
instances, is favourable to the licentious 
indulgence of the natural passions. Thus 
it allows of fornication, adultery, drunk- 
enness, prodigality, duelling, and of re- 
venge in the extreme, and lays- no stress 
upon the virtues opposite to these.

Laws, remedial, a fancied law, which

mercy to mankind, has abolished that 
rigorous constitution or law that they

has introduced a more mild constitution,

LEARNING, skill in any science, 
or that improvement of the mind which 
we gain by study, instruction, observa- 
tion, &amp;c. An attenti\'e examination of 
ecclesiastical history Avill lead us to see 
how greatly learning is indebted to 
Christianity, and tliat Christianity, in 
its tuni, has been much served by learn- 
ing. " All the useful learning," says 
Dr. Jortin, " which is now to be found 
in the world, is in a great measure 
owing to the Gospel. The Christians, 
who had a great veneration for the Old 
Testament, have contributed more than 
the Jews themselves to secure and ex- 
plain those books. The Christians in 
ancient times collected and preserved 
the Greek versions of the Scriptures, 
particulai'ly the Septuagint, and trans- 
lated the originals into Latin. To 
Christians wei-e due the old Hexapla ; 
and in later times Christians have 
published the Polyglots and the Sama- 
ritan Pentateuch, it was the study of 
the Holy Scriptures which excited 



Christians from early times to study 
chrenology, sacred and secular; and 
here much knowledge of history, and 
some skill in astronomv, were needful. 
The New Testament, feeing written in 
Greek, caused Christians to apply 
themselves also to the study of that 
langiiage. As the CTiristians were op- 
posed by the Pagans and the Jews, they 
were excited to the study of Pagan and 
Jewish literature, in order to expose 
the absurdities of the Jewish traditions, 
the weakness of Paganism, and tiie im- 
perfections and insufficiency of philoso- 
phy. The first fathers, till the third 
century, were generally Greek -Avriters. 
In the third century the Latin language 
was much upon the decline, but the 
Christians presei^ved it from sinking 
into absolute barbarism. Monker)^, in- 
deed, produced many sad effects ; but 
Providence here also brouglit good out 
of evil ; for the monks were employed 
in the transcribing of books, and many 
valuable authors would have perished 
if it had not been for the monasteries. 
In the ninth century, the Saracens were 
very studious, and contributed much to 
the restoration of letters. But, what- 
ever was good in tlie Mahometan reli- 
gion, it is in no small measure indebted 
to Christianity for it, since Mahometan- 
ism is made up for the most part of Ju- 
daism and Christianity. If Christianity 
had been suppressed at its first appear- 
ance, it is extremely probable that the 
Latin and Greek tongues would have 
been lost in the revolution of empires, 
and the. irruptions of barbarians in the 
east and in tlie west ; for the old inha- 
bitants would have had no cofiscientious 
and religious motives to keep up their 
language ; and then, togetlier with tlie 
Latin and Greek tongues, the knowle.dge 
of antiquities and the ancient writers 
would have been destroyed. To whom, 
then, are we indebted for the knowledge 
of antiquity, for every thing that is called 
philosophy, or the literx humaniores? 
— to Christians. To whom for gram- 
mars and dictionaries of the learned 
languages ? — to Christians. To whom 
for chronology, and the continuation of 
history through many centuries? — to 
Christians. '1 o whom for rational sys- 
tems of morality, and improvements in 
natural philosojihy, ruid for the applica- 
tions of these discoveries to religions 
purposes ? — to Christians. To whom for 
metaphysical researches, carried as far 
as the s'ubject will ])crmit ? — to Chris- 
tians. To whom for the moral mles to be 
observed by nations in war and peace ? 
— to Christians. To whom for juris- 
prudence, and for political knowledge.

" As religion hath been the chief pre- 
sei^ver of ei-udition, so enidition hath 
not been ungrateful to her patroness, 
but hath contributed largely to the sup- 
port of religion. The useful expositions 
of the Scriptures, the sober and sensi- 
ble defences of revelation, the faithful 
I'epresentations of pure and vnidefiled 
Cnristianity ; these have been the 
works of learned, judicious, and indus- 
ti'ious men." Nothhig, however, is 
more common than to hear the ignorant 
decry all human learning as entirely 
useless in religion ; and what is still 
more remarkable, even some, who call 
themselves preachers, entertain the 
same sentiments. But to such we can 
only say what a judicious preacher ob- 
served upon a public occasion, that if 
all men had been as unlearned as them- 
selves, they never would have had a 
text on which to have displayed their 
ignorance. Dr. Jortiii^s Sermorh, vol.

LECTURES, RELIGIOUS, are 
discourses or sermons delivered by 
ministers on any subject in theology. 
Beside lectures on the sabbath day, 
many think proper to preach on week 
days ; sometimes at five in the morning, 
before people go to work, and at seven 
in the evening, after they have done. 
In London there is preaching almost 
every forenoon and evening in the 
weet, at some place or other. It may 
be objected, howevei', against week-day 
preaching, that it has a* tendency to 
take people from their business, and 
that the number of places open on a 
sabbath day supersedes the necessity 
of it. But m answer to this may it not 
be observed, 1. That people stand in 
need at all times of religious instraction, 
exhortation, and comfort? — 2. That 
tliere is a probability of converting sin- 
ners then as well as at other times ? — 
3. That ministers are commanded to 
be instant in season and out of season ? 
— And, 4. It gives ministers an oppor- 
tunity of hearing one another, which is 
of great utility. After all, it must be 
remarked, that he who can hear the 
truth on a sabbath day does not act con- 
sistently to neglect his family or business 
to be always present at week-day lec- 
tures ; nor is he altogether wise who has 
an opportunity of receiving instruction, 
yet altogether oeglects it 



LECTURES BAMPTON, a course 
of eight sermons preached annually at 
the imiversity of Oxford, set on foot by 
the Reveiend John Bumpton, canon of 
Salisljury. — According to the directions 
in his will they are to l)e preached u])on 
either of the following subjects: — To 
confirm, and establish the Christian 
faith, and to confute all heretics and 
schismatics ; upon tlie divine autliority 
of the holy Scriptures ; upon the au- 
thority- of the writings of the primitive 
fatherSj as to the faith and practice of 
the primitive church ; upon the divinity 
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ ; 
upon the divinity of the Holy Gliost ; 
upon the articles of the Cliristian faith, 
as comprehended in the Apostles' and 
Nicene creeds. For the support of 
this lecture, he bequeathed his lands 
and estates to the chancellor, raa,sters, 
and scliolars of the University of Ox- 
ford for ever, upon trust that the vice- 
chancellor for the time being take and 
receixe all the rents and profits there- 
of; and, after all taxes, reparations, 
and necessaiy deductions made, to pay- 
all the remainder to the endowment 
of these divinity lecture sermons. He 
also directs in his will, that no person 
shall be qualified to preach these lec- 
tures unless he have taken the degree 
of master of arts, at least in one of the 
two universities of Oxford or Cam- 
bridge, and that the same person shall 
never preach the same sermon twice. A 
number of excellent sermons preached 
at this lecture ai'e now before the public. 
A more enlarged account of this lecture 
may be seen in the Christian Observer 
for May, 1809.

LECTURE MERCHANTS, a lec- 
ture set up in the year 16"2 by the Pres- 
byterians and Independents, to show 
their agreement among themselves, as 
well as to support the doctrines of the 
Reformation against the prevailing er- 
rors of Popery, Socinianism, and In- 
fidelity. The principal ministers for 
learning and popularity were chosen 
as lecturers ; such as Dr. Bates, Dr. 
Manton, Dr. Owen, Mr. Baxter, Mr. 
Collins, Jenkins, Mead, and afterwards 
Ml*. Alsop, How, Cole, and others. 
It was encouraged and supported by 
some of the principal merchants and 
tradesmen of the city. Some misun- 
derstanding taking place, the Presby- 
terians removed to Salter's-hall, and 
the Independents remained at Pinner's- 
hall, . and each party filled up their 
numbers out of their respective de- 
nominations. This lecture is kept up

LECTURES, MORNING, certain 
casuistical lectures, which were preach- 
ed by some of the most able divines in 
London. The occasion of these lectures 
seems to be this: During the trouble- 
some time of Charles I. most of the 
citizens having some near relation or 
friend in the army of the earl of Essex, 
so many bills were sent up to the pulpit 
every Lord's Day for their preserva- 
tion, that the minister had neither time 
to read them, nor to recommend their 
cases to God in prayer ; it was, there- 
fore, agreed by some London divines 
to separate an hour for this purpose 
ever\' morning, one half to be spent in 
prayer, and the other in a suitable ex- ] 
hortation to the people. When the 
heat of the war was over, it became a 
casuistical lecture, and was carried on 
till the restoration of Charles IL These 
sermons were afterwards published in 
several volumes quarto, under the title 
of the morning exercises. The authors 
were the most eminent preachers of 
the day : Mr. (afterwards archbishop) 
Tillotson was one of them. It appears 
that these lectures were held ever)- 
morning for one month only ; and from 
the preface to the volume, dated 16S9, 
the time was afterwards contracted to 
a fortnight. Most of these were deli- 
vered at Cripplegate church, some at 
St. Giles's, and a volume against popery 
in South wark. Mr. Neale observes, tliat 
this lecture was afterwards revived 
m a different form, and continued in his 
day. It was kept up long afterwards 
at several places in the summer, a week 
at each place ; but latterly the time 
was exchanged for the evening.

LECTURE WARBURTONIAN, 
a lecture founded by bishop Warburton 
to prove the truth of revealed religion 
in general, and the Christian in par- 
ticular, from the completion of the pro- 
phecies in the Old and New Testament 
which relate to the Chiistian church, 
especially to the apostacy of papal 
Rome. To this foundation we owe the 
admirable discourses of Hurd, Halifax, 
Bagot, and many others. 

LECTURERS, in the church of Eng- 
land, are an order of preachers dis- 
tinct from the rector, vicai', and curate. 
They are chosen by the vestry, or chief 
inhabitants of the parish, supported Ijy 
voluntary subscriptions and legacies, 
and are usually the afternoon preach- 
ers, and sometimes officiate on some 



stated day in the week. Where there 
are lectures founded by the donations 
of pious persons, the lecturers are ap- 
pointed by the founders, Avithout any 
mterposition or consent of rectors of 
churches, &amp;c. though with the leave 
and approbation of the bishop ; such as 
that of Lady Moycr's at St. Paul's. But 
the lecturer is not entitled to the pulpit 
without the consent of the rector or 
vicar, who is possessed of the freehold 
of the church. 

LEGAL or MOSAICK DISPEN- 
SATION. See Dispensation. 

LEGALIST, strictly speaking, is 
one who acts according to or consistent 
with the law ; but in general the term 
is made use of to denote one who ex- 
pects salvation by his own works. We 
may farther consider a legalist as one 
who has no proper conviction of the 
evil of sin ; who, although he pretends 
to abide by the law, yet has not a just 
idea of its spirituality and demands. 
He is ignorant of the grand scheme of 
salvation by free grace : proud of his 
own fancied righteousness, he submits 
not to the righteousness of God ; he 
derogates from the honour of Christ, by 
mixing his own works with his ; and, 
in fact, denies the necessity of the work 
of the Spirit, by supposing that he has 
ability in himself to perform all those 
duties which God has required. Such 
is the character of the legalist ; a cha- 
racter diametrically opposite to that of 
the true Christian, whose sentiment 
corresponds with that of the apostle, 
I who justly observes, " By grace are ye 
I saved through faith, and that not of 
j yourselves : it is the gift of God. Not 
i of works, lest any man should boast."

LEGEND, originally a book, in the 
Romish church, containing the lessons 
that were to be read in divine service :• 
from lience the word was applied to the 
histories of the lives of saints, because 
chapters were read out of them at ma- 
tins ; but as thet'o/fZen legend, compiled 
by James de Varase, about the year 
1290, contained in it seveial ridiculous 
and I'omantic stories, the word is now 
used by Protestants to signify any in- 
credible or inauthentic narrative. 
Hence, as Dr. Jortin observes, we have 
false legends concerning the miracles 
of Christ, of his apostles, and of ancient 
Christians; and the writers of these 
fables had, in all probability, as good 
natural abilities as the disciples of 
Christ, and some of them wanted

neither learning nor craft ; and yet 
they betray themselves by faults against 
chronology, against history, against 
manners and customs, against morality, 
and against probability. A liar of this 
kind can never pass undiscovered ; but 
an honest I'elater of truth and matter 
of fact is safe : he wants no artifice, and 
fears ^ no examination. 

LEGION, THEBIAN, a name gi- 
ven, in the time of Dioclesian, to a 
whole legion of Christians, consisting 
of more than six thousand men, who 
were said to have suffered martyrdom 
by the order of Maximian. Though 
this story had never Avanted patrons, 
yet it is disbelieved by many. Dr Jor- 
tin, in his usual facetious way, says, that 
it stands upon the authority of one Eu- 
cherius, bishop of Lyons, and a writer 
of the fifth century, who had it from 
Theodorus, another bishop who had 
the honour and felicity to find the re- 
liques of these martyrs by revelation, 
and perhaps by the smell of the bonesi 

LECilON, THUNDERING, a name 
given to those Christians who served 
in the Roman army of Marcus Antoni- 
nus, in the second century. The occa- 
sion of it was this : — When that empe- 
ror was at war with the Marcomanni, 
his army was enclosed by the enemy, 
and reduced to the most deplorable con- 
dition by the thirst under which they 
languished in a parched desert. Just 
at this time they were remarkably re- 
lieved by a sudden and unexpected 
rain. This event was attributed to the 
Christians, who were supposed to have 
effected this by their prayers ; and the 
name of the thundering legion was 
given to them, on account of the thunder 
and lightning that destroyed the enemy, 
while the shower revived the fainting 
Romans. Whether this was really mi- 
I'aculous or not, has been disputed 
among learned men. They who wish 
to see what has been said on both sides, 
may consult Witsius Dissertat. de Le- 
gione Fulminatrice, which is subjoined 
to his JEgyjitiaca, in defence of this 
miracle ; as - also, what is alleged 
against it by Dan Lauroque, in a dis- 
course upon that subject, subjoined to 
the Adversaria Sacra of Matt. Lau- 
roque, his father. The controversy 
between Sir Peter King and Mr. Moyle 
upon this subject is also worthy of at- 
tention. 

LENT, a solemn time of fasting in 
the Christian church, observed as a 
time of humiliation before Easter. The 
Romish church, and some of the Pro- 
testant communion, maintain, that it 
■was always a fast of forty days, and, as 



such, of apostolical institution. Others 
think that it was of ecclesiastical in- 
stitution, and that it was variously ob- 
served in different churclies, and gi'ew 
by degrees from a fast of forty hours to 
a fast of forty days. This is the senti- 
ment of Morton, bishop Taylor, Du 
Moulin, D?iUe, and others. Anciently 
the manner of obsei'ving Lent among 
those who were piously disposed, was 
to abstain from food till evening : their 
only refreshment was a supper, and it 
was indifferent whether it was ftesh or 
any other food, provided it was used 
with sobriety and moderation. Lent 
was thought the proper time for exer- 
cising more abundantly eveiy species 
of charity : thus what they spared of 
their own bodies by abridging them of 
a meal, was usually given to the poor : 
they employed their vacant hours iji 
visiting the sick and those that were in 
prison ; in entertaining strangers, and 
reconciling differences. The Imperial 
laws forbade all prosecution of men in 
criminal actions that might bring them 
to corporal punishment and torture 
during the whole season. This was a 
time of more than ordinary strictness 
and devotion, and therefore, in many 
of the great churches, they had reli- 
gious assemblies for pi-ayer and pi'each- 
hig every day. All public games agA 
stage plays were prohibited at this s^- 
son, and also the celebration of all festi- 
vals, birthdays, and marriages. The 
Christians of the Greek church ob- 
serve four Lents ; the first commences 
on the fifteenth of November : the se- 
cond is the same with our Lent : the 
third begins the week after Whitsun- 
tide, and continues till the festival of St. 
Peter and St. Paul ; and the fourth com- 
mences on the first of August, and lasts 
no longer than till the fifteenth. These 
Lents are observed with great strict- 
ness and austerity, but on Saturdays 
and Sundays they indulge themselves m 
drinking wine and using oil, which are 
prohibited on other days. 

LESSONS, among ecclesiastical wri- 
ters, are portions of the holy Scrip- 
tures read in chui'ches at the time of 
divine service. In the ancient church, 
reading the Scripture was one part of 
the service of the catechumen, at 
which all persons were allowed to be 
present in order to obtain instruction. 
The church of England, in the choice 
of lessons, pi'oceeds as follows : — for all 
the first lessons on ordinary days, she 
directs to begin at the beginning of the 
year with Genesis, and so continue till 
the books of the Old Testament are 
read over, only omitting Chronicles, 



LEV

LIB 



which are for the most part the same ! 
■with the books of Samuel and Kings ;| 
and other particular chapters in other 
books, either because they contain the 
names of persons, places, or other mat- 
ters less profitable to ordinary readers. 
I'he course of the first lessons for Sun- 
days is regulated after a different man- 
ner : from Advent to Septuagesima 
Sunday, some pai-ticular chapters of 
Isaiah are appointed to be read, because 
that book contains the clearest pro- 
phecies concerning Christ. Upon Sep- 
tuagesima Sunday, Genesis is begun ; 
because that ]iook, which treats of the 
fall of man, and the severe judgment 
of God inflicted on the world for sin, 
best suits with a time of repentance and 
mortification. After Genesis follow 
chapters out of the books of the Old 
Testament, as they lie in order; only 
on festival Sundays, such as Easter, 
Whitsunday, &amp;c., the particular histo- 
ry relating to that day is appointed to 
be read ; and on the saints' days the 
church ajjjjoints lessons out of the moral 
books, such as Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, 
8cc., as containing excellent instructions 
for the conduct of life. As to the se- 
cond lessons, the church oljserves the 
same course both on Sundays aiid 
week-days;, reading the (iospel and 
Acts of the Apostles in the morning, 
OTd the Epistles in the evening, in 
the order they stand in the New Tes- 
tament ; excepting on saints' days and 
holy days, when such lessons are ap- 
pointed as either explain the mystery, 
relafe the history, or apply the example 
to us. 
LEUCOPETRIANS, the name of a 
' fanatical sect which sprang up in the 
Greek and eastern churches towards 
the close of the twelfth century : they 
professed to believe in a double trinity, 
rejected wedlock, abstained from flesh, 
treated with the utmost contempt the 
sacraments of baptism and the Loi'd's 
supper, and all the various branches of 
external worship : placed the essence 
of religion in internal prayer alone ; and 
maintained, as it is said, that an evil 
being or genius dwelt in the breast of 
every mortal, and could be expelled 
from thence by no other method than 
by pei'petual supplication to the Su- 
preme Being. The founder of this sect 
js said to have been a person called 
Leucojietrus, and his chief disciple 
Tychicus, who corrupted by fanatical 
interpretations several books of Scrip- 
ture, and particularly St. Matthew's 
Gospel. 

LEVITY, lightness of spirit, in oji- 
position to gravity. Nothing can be 



mo\'e proper than for a Christian t« 
wear an air of cheerfulness, and to 
watch against a morose and gloomy 
disposition. But though it be his pri- 
vilege to rejoice, yet he must be cau- 
tious of that volatility of spirit which 
characterises the unthinking, and marks 
the vain professor. To be cheerful 
without levity, and grave without aus- 
terit}', form both a happy and dignified 
character. 

LIBATION, the act of pouring wine 
on tlie ground in divine worsliip. Some- 
times other liquids have been used, as 
oil, milk, water, honey, but mostly wine. 
Amongst the Greeks and Romans it 
was an essential part of solemn sacri- 
fices. Libations were also in use among 
the Hebrews, who poured a hin of wine 
on the victim after it was killed, and 
the several pieces of the sacrifice were 
laid on the altar ready to be consumed 
in the flames. 

LIBERALITY, bounty ; a generous 
disposition of mind, exerting itself in 
giving largely. It is thus distinguished 
from genei'osity and bounty : — Liberali- 
ty implies acts of mere giving or spend- 
ing; ^§-f'?iero67Yv, acts of greatness ; houn- 
(y, acts of kindness. Liberality is a 
natural disposition ; generosity proceeds 
from elevation of sentiment ; bounty^ 
from religious motives. Liberality de- 
notes freedom of spirit ; generosity^ 
greatness of soul, bounty, openness of 
heart. 

LIBERALITY of sentiment, a ge- 
nerous disposition a man feels towards 
another who is of a different opinion 
from himself; or, as one defines it, 
"that generous expansion of mind 
which enables it to look beyond all 
petty 'distiiy;tions of party and' system, 
and, in the estimate of men and things, 
to rise superior to narrow prejudices." 
As liberality of sentiment is often a 
cover for error and scepticism on the 
one hand, and as it is too little attended 
to by the ignorant and bigoted on the 
other, we shall here lay before our 
readers a view of it by a masterly wri- 
ter. " A man of liberal sentiments 
must be distinguished from him who 
hath no religious sentiments at all. He 
is one who hath seriously and effectually 
investigated, both in his Bible and on 
his knees, in public assemblies and in 
pri\ ate conversations, the important ar- 
ticles of religion. He hath laid down 
principles, he hath inferred conse- 
quences ; in a word, he hath adopted 
sentiments of his own. 

"He must be distinguished also from 
that tame undiscerning domestic among 
good people, who, though he has senti- 



. LIB 305 

meuts of his own, yet has not judginent 
to estimate the worth and value of one 
sentiment beyond another. 

"Now a generous believer of the 
Christian reli,^ion is one who will never 
allow himselt to try to propagate his 
sentiments by the commission of sin. 
No collusion, no bitterness, no wrath, no 
undue influence of any kind, will he ap- 
ply to make his sentiments receivable ; 
and no living thing will be less happy 
for his being a Christian. He will ex- 
ercise his liberality by allowhig those 
who differ from him as much virtue and 
integrity as he possibly can. 

"There are, among a multitude of 
•arguments to enforce such a disposition, 
the following worthy our attention. 

" First, We should exercise liberality 
in union with sentiment, because of the 
different capacities, advantages, and 
tasks of mankind. Religion employs 
the capacities of mankind, just as the air 
employs their lungs and their organs of 
speech. The fancy of one is lively, of 
another dull. The judgment of one is 
elastic ; of another feeble, a damaged 
spring. The memory of one is reten- 
tive ; that of another is treacherous as 
the wind. The passions of this man are 
lofty, vigorous, rapid ; those of that man 
crawl, and hum, and buz, and, when on 
'wing, sail only round the circumference 
of a tulip. Is it conceivable that capa- 
bility, so different in every thing else, 
should be all alike in religion ? The ad- 
vantages of mankind differ. How should 
he who hath no parents,, no books, no 
tutor, no companions, equal him whom 
Providence hath gratified with them 
all ; who, when he looks over the trea- 
sures of his own knowledge, can say, 
this I had of a Greek, that I learned of 
a Roman ; this information I acquired of 
my tutor, that was a present of my fa- 
ther : a friend gave me this branch of 
knowledge, an acquaintance bcqueatli- 
ed me that i* The tasks of mankmd dif- 
fer; so I call the employments and ex- 
ercises of life. In my opinion, circum- 
stances make gi-eat men ; and if we have 
not Caesars in the state, and Pauls in the 
church, it is because neither church nor 
state are in the circumstances in which 
they were in the days of those great 
men. Push a dull man into a ri\er, and 
endanger his life, and suddenly he will

he, whose joung and tender heart is yet 
unpractised in trials of this kind, can 
have ascertained and tasted so many 
I'cligious truths as the suflierer hns i* 

"We should believe the Christian re- 
ligion with liberality, in the second place, 
because every Jiart of the Christian re- 
ligion inculcates generosity. Christiani- 
ty gives us a cliaracter of God ; but 
my God ! wha't a character does it give ! 
God is LOVE. Christianity teaches 
the doctrine of Providence; but what 
a providence ! U/W7i ivhom doth not- 
its light arise I Is there an animalcule 
so little, or a wretch so forlorn, as to 
be forsaken and forgotten of his God ? 
Christianity teaches the doctrine of 
redemption: but the redemption of 
whom? — of all tongues, kindred, na- 
tions, and people: of the infant of a 
span, and the smner of a hundred years 
old : a redemption generous in its prui- 
ciple, generous in its price, generous in 
its effects ; fixed sentiments of Divine 
munificence, and re\ealed with a libe- 
rality for which we have no name.. lu 
a .word, the illiberal Christian always 
acts contrary to the spirit of his reli- 
gion ; the liberal man alone thoroughly 
understands it. 

"Thirdly, We should be liberal, be-, 
cause no other spirit is exemfilijied in 
the infallible gaiides whom we profess to 
follow. I set one Paul against a whole 
army of uninspired men : ' Some preach 
Christ of good will, and some of envy 
and strife. What then? Christ is 
preached ; and I therein do rejoice, yea, 
and will i-ejoice. One eateth all things, 
another eatetli herbs ; but why dost 
THOU judge thy brother? We shall' 
all stand before the judgment seat of 
Christ.' We often inquire, What was 
the doctrine of Christ, and what was 
the practice of Christ; suppose we 
were to institute a third question, Of 
what TEMPER was Christ? 

"Once more: We should be liberal 
as well as orthodox, because ti-uth, es- 
pecially the truths of Christianity, do 
not want any support from our illibe- 
rality. Let the little bee guird its little 
honey with its little sting ; jjerhaps its 
little life may depend a little while on 
that little nourishment. Let the fierce 
bull shake his head, and nod his horn, 
and threaten his enemy, who seeks to 
eat his flesh, and wear his coat, and 
live by his death : poor fellow ! his life 
is in danger ; I forgive his bellowing and 
his rage. But the Chi'istian religion,— 
is that in danger ? and what human ef- 
forts can render that trae which is false, 
that odious which is lovelv ? Christian!-

"In fine, liberality in the profession of 
religion is a ivise and bniocent fiolicy. 
The bigot lives at home ; a reptile he 
crawled into existence, and there in his 
hole he lurks a reptile still. A gener- 
ous Christian goes out of Jnis own party, 
associates with others and gains im- 
provement by all. It is a Persian pro- 
verb, A liberal hand is better than a 
strong arm. The dignity of 'Christianity 
is better supported by acts of liberality 
than by accuracy of reasoning : but 
when both go together, when a man of 
sentiment can clearly state and ably de- 
fend his religious principles, and when 
his heai-t is as generous as his principles 
are inflexible, he possesses strength and 
beauty in an eminent degree." See 
Theot. Misc. vol. i. p. 39. 

LIBERTINE, one who acts without 
restraint, and pays no regard to the pre- 
cepts of religion. 

LIBERTINES, according to some, 
■were such Jews as were free citizens of 
Rome : they had a separate synagogue 
at Jerusaleiii, and sundry of them con- 
curred in the persecution of Stephen, 
Acts vi. 9. Dr. Guyse supposes that 
those who had obtained this privilege 
by gift were ctdled liberti (free men,) 
and those who had obtained it by pur- 
chase, libertini (made free,) in distinction 
from original native free-men. Dr. 
Doddridge thinks tliat they were called 
Libertines as having been the children 
of freed men, that is, of emancipated 
captives or slaves. See Doddridge and 
Giiyse on Acts vi. 9. 

LIBERTINES, a religious sect Avhich 
arose ui the year 1525, whose principal 
tenets were, that the Deity was the sole 
operating cause m the mind of man, 
and the immediate author of all human 
actions ; that, consequently, the distinc- 
tions of good and evil, which had been 
established with regard to those actions, 
were false and groimdless, and that men 
could not, properly speaking, commit 
sin ; that religion consisted in the union 
of the spirit, or rational soul, with the 
Supreme Being ; that all those who had 
attained this happy union, by sublime 
contemplation and elevation of mind, 
were then allowed to indulge, without 
exception or restraint, their appetites 
or passions; that all their actions and 
pursuits were tlien perfectly innocent ; 
and that, after the death of the body, 
they were to be united to the Deity. 
They likewise said that Jesus Christ 
was nothing but a mere je ne scai quoi, 



composed of the spirit of God and the 
opinion of men. These maxims occa- 
sioned their beuig called Libertines, 
and the word has been used in an ill 
sense ever since. This sect spread 
principally in Holland and Brabant. 
Their leaders were one Quintin, a Pi- 
card, Pockesius, RufFus, and anothei', 
called Chopin, who joined with Quintin, 
and became his disciple. They obtain- 
ed footing in France through the favour 
and protection of Margaret, queen of 
Navarre, and sister to Jr'rancis I. and 
found patrons in several of the reform- 
ed churches. 

Liberti?ies of Gaieva were a cabal of 
rakes rather than of fanatics ; for they 
made no pretence to any religious sys- 
tem, but pleaded only for the liberty of 
leading voluptuous and immoral lives. 
This cabal was composed of a certain 
number of licentious citizens, who could 
not bear the severe discipline of Calvin. 
There were also among them several 
who were not only notorious for their 
dissolute and scandalous manner of liv- 
ing, but also for their atheistical impie- 
ty and contempt of all religion. To this 
odious class belonged one Gniet, who 
denied the divmity of the Christian re- 
ligion, the immortality of the soul, the 
difference between moral good and evil, 
and rejected with disdain the doctrines 
that are held most sacred among Chris- 
tians ; for which impieties he Avas at last 
brought befoi-e the civil tribunal in the 
year 1550, and condemned to death. 

LIBERTY denotes a state of free- 
dom, in contradistinction to slavery or 
restraint. — 1. JMatural liberty, or liberty 
of choice, is that in which our volitions 
are not determined by any foreign cause 
or consideration whatever offered to it, 
but by its own pleasure. — 2. External 
liberty, or liberty of action, is opposed 
to a constraint laid on the executive 
powers ; and consists in a power of ren- 
dering our volitions effectual. — 3. Philo- 
sofihical liberty consists in a prevailing 
disposition to act according to the dic- 
tates of reason, i. e. in such a manner as 
shall, all things considered, most ef- 
fectually promote our happiness. — 4. 
Moral liberty is said to be that in which 
there is no interposition of the wiU of a 
supei ior being to prohibit or determine 
our actions in any particular under con- 
sideration. See Necessity, Will. — 
5. Liberty of conscience is freedom from 
restraint in'our choice of, and judgment 
about matters of religion. — 6. SJiiritual 
liberty consists in freedom from the 
curse of the moral law; from the servi- 
tude of the ritual ; from the love, power^ 
and guilt of sin ; from the dominion of

LITANY, a general supplication used 
in public worship to appease the wrath 
of the Deity, and- to recniest those bless- 
ings a perscm wants. The word comes 
from the Greek xiravtia, "supplication," 
of xiTovecd, "I beseech." At first, the 
use of litanies was not fixed to any stated 
time, but Avere only employed as exi- 
gencies required. Tliey were observed, 
in imitation of the Nine\ ites, with ar- 
dent supplications and fastings, to avert 
the threatened judgments of fire, earth- 
quake, inundations, or hostile invasions. 
About the year 400, litanies began to 
be used in processions, the people walk- 
ing barefoot, and repeating them with 
great dexotjpn : and it is pretended 
that by this means sca eral countries 
were delivered from great calamities. 
The days on which they were used 
were called Rogation da) s ; these were 
appointed by the canons of different 
councils, till it was decreed by the 
council of Toledo, that they should be 
used every month throughout the year ; 
and thus, by degrees, they came to be used 
weekly on Wednesdays and Fridays, 
the ancient stationary days for fasting. 
To these days the rubric of the church 



LIT 



of England has added Sundays, as being 
the greatest day for assembling at di\'ine 
sci-A'ice. Before the last review of the 
common prater, the htany was a dis- 
tinct service by itself, ana used some- 
times after the morning prayer was 
over ; at present it is made one office 
with the morning service, being ordered 
to be read after the third collect for 
grace, instead of the intercessional 
prayers in the daily sennce. 

LITURGY denotes all the ceremo- 
nies m genei-al belonging to di\^ine ser- 
vice. The word comes from the Greek 
XfiT8f7ia, "service, public ministry," 
formed of \£it.-.i, "public," and sy^oi, 
"work." In a moi-e restrained signifi- 
cation, liturgy is used among the Ro- 
manists to signify the mass, and among 
us the common prayer. All who have 
written on liturgies agree, that, in pri- 
mitiAC days, divine service was exceed- 
ingly simple, clogged with a very few 
ceremonies, and consisted of but a small 
number of prayers ; but, by degrees, 
they increased the number of ceremo- 
nies, and added new prayer.s, to make 
the office look more awful and \ enera- 
ble to the people. At length, things 
were carried to sr.-.h a pitch, that a re- 
gidation became necessaiy ; and it w^s 
tound necessary to put the service and 
the manner of performing it into writ- 
ing, and this was what they called a li- 
turgy. Liturgies have been different ^at 
different times and in different countries. 
We have the liturg^s' of St. Chrysostom, 
of St. Peter, the Armenian liturgy, Gal- 
lican liturgy, &amp;c. &amp;c. "The proper- 
ties required in a public liturgy," says 
Paley, " are these : it must be compen- 
dious ; express just conceptions of the 
divine attributes ; recite such wants as 
a congregation are likely to feel, and no 
other ; and contain as few controverted 
propositions as possible." The liturgy 
of the church of England was compos- 
ed in the year 1547, and established m 
the second year of king Edward VI. In 
the fifth year of this king it was reviewed, 
because some things were contained ui 
that liturgy Avhich shewed a compliance 
with the superstition of those times, and 
some exceptions were taken against it 
by some learned men at home, and by 
Calvin abroad. Some alterations Avere 
made in it, which consisted in adding 
the general confession and absolution, 
and the communion to begin %\'ith the 
ten commandments. The use of oil in 
confirmation and extreme unction was 
lett out, and also pravers for souls de- 
parted, and what related to a belief of 
Christ's real, presence in the eucharist. 
I'his liturgj', so retomied, was establish-

ed by the acts of the 5th and 6th Ed- 
•ward VI. cap. 1. However, it was abo- 
lished by queen Mary, \\ho enacted, 
that the service should stand as it was 
iTiost commonly used in the last year of 
the reign of king Henry Vill. — That of 
Edward VI. was re-established, with 
some alterations, by Elizabeth. Some 
faither alterations were introduced, in 
consequence of the review of the com- 
mon prayer book, by order of kirig 
James, in' the first year of his reign, pai- 
ticularly in the ofhce of private bap- 
tism, in several iiibrics, and other pas- 
sages, with the addition of five or six 
new prayers and thanksgi\ings, and all 
that pait of the catechism which con- 
tains the doctririe of the saci'aments. 
The book of common prayer, so altered, 
i-emained in force from the first year 
of king James to the fourteenth of 
Charles II. The last review of the li- 
turgy was in the year 1661. Many sup- 
plications have been since made for a 
review, but without success. Bififf-

LIVERPOOL LITURGY, a litur-

Liveipool. It was composed by some 
of the Presbyterians, who, g'rowing 
weary of extempore prayer, thought a 
foiTn'more desiraole. It made its ap- 
pearance in 1752. Mr. Ortin says of it, 
" It is scarcely a Christian Liturgy. In 
the collect the name of Christ is hardly 
mentioned ; and the Spirit is quite ban- 
ished from it." It was little better than 
a dcistical composition. Oi'ton's Letters,

LOLLARDS, a religious sect, differ- 
ing in many points from the church of 
Rome, wiiich arose in Germany about 
the beginning of the fourteenth century ; 
so called, as many writers have imagin- 
ed, from Walter Lollard, who began to 
dogmatize in 1315, and was bmiit at 
Cologne ; though others thirik that Lol- 
lard was no surname, but merely a term 
of reproach applied to all heretics who 
concealed the- poison of eri'or under the 
appearance of piety. 

The monk ot Canterbury derives the 
origin of the word loUai-d among us 
from loliu?n, "a tai'e, " as if the Lol- 
lards were the tares sown in Clu-ist's 
\ jneyard. Abclly says, that the word 



signifies " praising God," from the Ger- 
man loben "to praise," and herr, 
"lord ;" because the I^ollards employed 
themselves in tra\cliing about from 
place to place, singing psalms and 
hymns. Others, much to the same pur- 
pose, derive lollhard, lullhard, ov lotlert, 
lullert, as it was written hy the ancient 
Germans, from the old German wov^ 
lullen, lollen, or luUen, and the termi- •^ 
nation hard, with which many of the 
high Dutch words end. Lollen signi- 
fies " to sing with a lo\v voice," ■ and 
therefore lollard is a singer, or one who 
frequently sings ; and in the \idgar 
tongue of the Germans it denotes a per- 
son who is continually praising God 
with a song, or singing hymns to his 
honour. 

The Alexians or Cellites were called 
Lollards, because they were public 
singers, who made it their business to 
inter the bodies of those ^vho died of the 
plague, and sang a dirge o^■er them, in 
a mournful and indistinct tone, as they 
carried them to the gra\ e. The name 
was afterwards assumed by persons that 
dishonoured it, for we find among those 
Lollards who made extraordinary pre- 
tences to religion, and spent the great- 
est part ,of their time in meditati&lt;jn, 
l&gt;ra5"er, and such acts of piety, there 
were many abominable. hypocrites, who 
entertained the most ridiculous opinions, 
and concealed the most enoi'mous vices 
under tlie specious mark of this extra- 
oidinary profession. Many injurious 
aspersions were therefore propagated 
against those who assumed this name 
by the priests and monks ; so that, bj"^ 
degrees, any persons who covered here- 
sies or crimes under the appearance of 
I^iety was called a Lollard. Thus the 
name was not used to denote any one 
particular sect, but was formerly com- 
mon to all persons or sects who" were 
supposed to be guilty of impiety towards 
God or the church, under an external 
profession of great piety. Howe\'er, 
many societies, consisting both of men 
and women, under the name of Lollards, 
were formed in most parts of Germany 
and Flanders, and were supported part- 
ly by their manual labours, and partly 
by the charitable donations of pious per- 
sons. The magistrates and inhabitants 
of the towns where these brethren and 
sisters resided gave them particular 
marks of favour and protection, on ac- 
count of their great usefulness to the 
sick and needy. They were thus sup- 
ported against their malignant rivals, 
and obtained many papal constitutions, 
by which their institute was confirmed, 
their person's exempted from the cog- 



LOR J09 

nizance of the inquisitor, and subjected 
entirely to the jurisdiction of Uie hisliops ; 
but as these measures were insufti- 
rient -to secure tiiem from molestation, 
Charles duke of Burgvmdy. in the year 
1472, obtained a solemn bull from Sex- 
tus IV. ordering that the Cellitcs, or 
LoUaijls, should be ranked among the 
religious orders, and delixered from 
the jurisdiction of the bishops. And 
pope Julius II. granted them still greater 
privileges, in the year 1506. Mosheim 
informs us, that many societies of this 
kind are still subsisting at Cologne, and 
in the cities of Flanders, though they 
have evidently departed fi-om their an- 
cient rules. 

Lollard and his followers rejected the 
sacrifice of the mass, extreme unction, 
and penances for sin ; arguing that 
Christ's sufferings were sufficient. He 
is likewise said to have set aside bap- 
tism, as a thing of no effect ; and repen- 
tance as not absolutely necessary, 6cc. 
In England, the followers of Wickliffe 
were called, by way of reproach, Lol- 
lards, from the supposition that there 
was some affinity between some of their 
tenets; tliough others are of opinion that 
the English Lollards came from Ger- 
many. See WiCKI.IFFITES.

Perhaps there is no sin more common 
as to the practice, and less thought of 
as to the guilt of it, than this. Nor is it 
thus common with the vulgar only, but 
with those who call themselves wise, 
humane, and moral. They tremble at 
the idea of murder, theft, adultery, &amp;c. 
Avhile they forget that the same law

that of profaning his name. No maq, 
therefore, whatever his sense, abilities, 
or profession ma}- be, can be held goiilt- 
less, or be exonerated from tJie charge 
of being a wicked man, while he lives 
in the habitual violation of this part of 
God's sacred law. A veiy celebrated 
female writer justly observes, that "It 
is utterly inexcusable ; it has none of 
the -paWiAtrves oi tei)i/itatio77 which other 
vices plead, and in that respect stands 
distinguished from all othei-s both in its 
nature and degree of guilt. Like many 
other sins, however, it is at once cause 
and effect ; it proceeds from want of 
lo\ e and reverence to the best of Beings, 
and causes the want of that love both in 
themselves and others. This species of 
profaneness is not only sweaiTiig, but, 
perhaps, in some respects, swearing of 
the worst sort ; as it is a direct breach 
of an express command, and offends 
against the very letter of that law which 
says, in so many words, " Thou shalt not 
take the name of the Lord thy God in 
vain." It offends against politeness and 
good breeding, for those who commit it 
little think of the pain they are mfiict- 
ing on the sober mind, which is deeply 
wounded when it hears the holy name 
it loves dishonoured ; and it is as con- 
trary to good bleeding to give pain, as 
it is to ti-ue piety to be profane. It is 
astonishing that the refined and elegant 
should not i&gt;eprobate this pi'actice for its 
coarseness and vulgarity, as much as 
the pious abhor it for its sinfulness. 

"I would endeavour to give some 
faint idea of the grossness of this offence 
by an analogy, (oh ! how inadequate ! ) 
with which the feeling heart, even 
though not seasoned with religion, may- 
yet be touched. To such I would . ear- 
nestly say — Suppose you had some be- 
loved friend, — to put the case still •more ■ 
strongly, a departed friend, — a revered 
parent, perhaps, — whose image never 
occurs without awakening in your bosom 
sentiments of tender love and lively gra- 
titude ; how would you feel if you heard 
this honoured name bandied about with 
unfeeling familiarity and indecent le- 
vity ; or, at best, thnist into every pause 
of speech as a vulgar expletive ? — Does 
not your affectionate heart recoil at the 
thought ? And yet the hallowed name 
of your truest Benefactor, your heaven- 
ly Father, your best Friend, to whom 
you are indebted for all you enjoy ; who 
gives you those very friends m whom 
you so much delight, those very talents 
with which you dishonour him, those 
very organs of speech with which you 
blaspheme him, is treated with an ir- 
reverence, a contempt, a wantonness.

with wluch you cannot bear the very 
thought or mention of treating a human 
friend. Hk name is impiously, is unfeel-

object of decided n-reverence, of sys-

His sacred name is used indiscriminately 
to express anger, joy, grief, surprise, im-

unpardonable than all, it is wantonly 
used as a mere unmeaning expletive,

LORD'S PRAYER, is that which 
our Lord gave to his disciples on the 
Mount. According to what is said in the 
sixth chapter of Matthew, it was given 
a$ a directory ; but from Luke xi. 1. 
some argTie that it was given as 3. form. 
Some have urged that the second and 
fourth petition of that prayer could be 
intended only for a temporaiy use ; but 
it is answered, that such a sense may 
be put upon those petitions as shall suit 
all (Christians in all ages ; for it is al- 
ways our duty to pray that Christ's 
tiiigdom may be advanced in the world, 
and to profess our daily dependence on 
God's providential care. Nevertheless, 
there is no reason to believe that Christ 
meant that his people should always use 
this as.a set form'; for, if that had been 
the case, it would not have been varied 
as it is by the two evangelists. Matt. vi. 
Luke xi. It is true, indeed, that they 
both agree in the main, as to the sense, 
yet not in the express words ; and the 
cloxology which Matthew gives at large 
is wholly left out m Luke. And, besides, 
we do not find that the disciples e\'er 
used it as a form; It is, however, a most 
■excellent summary of prayer, for its 
bre\dty, order, and matter ; and it is 
very lawful and laudable to make use of 
any single petition, or the whole of. it, 
provided a formal and superstitious use 
of it be avoided. — That great zeal, as 
one observes, which is to be found in 
some Christians either for or against it, 
is to be lamented as a weakness ; and it 
will become us to do all that we can to 
promote on each side more moderate 
sentiments concerning the use of it. See

LORD'S "SUPPE,R is an ordinance 
which our Saviour instituted as acorn-. 
memoration of his death and sufferings. 
1. It is called a sacrament, that is, a sign 
and an oath. An outwai'd and visible 
sign of an inward and spiritual grace; 
an oath, by which we bind our souls 
with a bond unto the Lord. Some, how- 
ever, reject this term as not being scrip- 
tural ; as likewise the idea of swearing 
or vowing to the Lord. See Vow. — 2. It 
is called the Lord's Supper, because it 
was first instituted in the evening, and 
at the close of the Passover supper ; and 
because we therein feed upon Christ, 
the bread of life, Rom. iii. 20. 1 Cor. "xi. 
— 3. It is called the coinmiinioJi, as here- 
in we have communion with Christ, and 
with his people, 1 Cor. xii. 13. x. 17: — 
4. It is called the eucharist, a thanks- 
giving, because Christ, in the institutioii 
of it, gave thanks, 1 Cor. xi. 24. and be- 
cause we, in the participation of it, must 
give th.anks likewise. — 5. It is called a 
feast, and by some a feast upon a saci'i- 
fice (though not a sacrifice itself,) in al- 
lusion to. the custom of the Jews feast- 
ing upon their sacrifices, 1 Cor. x. 18. 

As to the nature of this ordinance, we 
mav obser^'e, that, in participating of 
the bread and wine, we do not consider 
it as expiatory, but, 1. Asa co7nmemo- 
ruting orduumce. We are here to re- 
member the person, love, and death of 
Christ, 1 Cor. xi. 24. — 2. A co/fessing 
ordinance. We hereby profess our es- 
teem for Christ, and dependence upon 
him. — 3. A communicating ordinance: 
blessings of grace are here communica- 
ted to us. — 4. A covenanting ordinance. 
God, in and by this ordinance, as it 
were, declares that he is ours, and we 
by it declare to be his. — 5. A standing 
oi'dinance, for it is to be observed to the 
end of time, 1 Cor. xi. 26. It seems to be 
quite an indifferent thing, what bread is 
used in this ordinance, or what coloured 
wine, for Christ took that which was 
readiest. The eating of the bread and 
drinking of the wine being always con- 
nected in Christ's example, they ought 
never to be separated : wherever one is 
gr\ en, the other should not be withheld. 
This bread and wine are not changed 
into the real body and blood of Christ, 
but are only emblems thereof. See 

Tr AN SUBSTANTIATION. 

The subjects of this ordinance should 
be such as make a credible profession 
of the Gospel : the ignorant, and those 
whose lives are immoral, have no right 
to it ; nor should it ever be administer- 
ed as a test of civil obedience, for this 



LOR 311 

is perverting the design of it. None but 
true believers can appi'oach it with 
pi-ofit ; yet we cannot exclude any who 
make a credible profession, for God 
only is the judge of the heart, while we 
can only act accoi-ding to outward ap- 
pearances. 

Much has been said respecting the 
time of adiyiiniatering it. Some plead 
for the morning, others the afternoon, 
and some for the evening ; which latter, 
indeed, was the time of the first celebra- 
tion of it, and is most suitable to a sup- 
per. How often it is to be observed, 
cannot be precisely ascertained from 
Scripture. Some have been for keep- 
ing it every day in the week ; others four 
times a week ; some every Lord's day, 
Avhich many think is nearest the apos- 
tolic lyactice, Acts xx. 7. Others have 
kept K three tiines a year, and- some 
once a year ; but the most common is 
once a month. It evidently appears, 
however, both from Scriptui-e, 1 Cor. xi. 
26. ancl from the nature of the oi-dinance, 
that it ought to be frequent. 

Afi to the posture : Dr. Doddridge 
justly observes, that it is greatly to be 
lamented that Christians have pervert- 
ed an ordinance, intended as a pledge 
and means of their mutual union^ into ah 
occasion of discord and contention, by 
laying such a disproportionate stress on 
the manner in which it is to be adminis- 
tered, and the posture in which it is to 
be received. As to the latter, a table 

Sosture seems most eligible, as having 
een used by Christ and his apostles, 
and being peculiarly suitable to the 
notion of a sacred feast ; and kneeling, 
which \\^as never intr(5duced into the 
church till transubstantiation was re- 
ceived, may prove an occasion of super- 
stition. Nevertheless, provided it be not 
absolutely imposed as a term of com- 
munion, it will be the part of Christian 
candour to acquiesce in the use of it in 
others by whom it is preferred. It ap- 
pears that standing was at least fre- 
quently used in the Christian church, 
viz. always on the Lord's day, and be- 
tween Easter and Whitsuntide. The 
manner m which this ordinance is ad- 
ministered, both in the church of Eng- 
land, and among Protestant Dissenters, 
is so well known, that we need say no- 
thing of it here. 

We will only subjoin a few directions 
ni what /j-o?«d' of mind we should attend 
upon this ordinance. It should be with 
sorrow for our past sins, and easiness 
and calmness of affection, free from the 
disoi'ders and ruffles of passion ; with a 
holy awe and reverence of the Divme 
Majesty, yet with a gracious confidence 



LOV 

and earnest desires toward God; with 
raised expectations; prayer, joy, aftid 
thanksgiving, and love to all men. Wheii 
coming from it, we should admire the 
condescensions of di\'ine grace ; watch 
against the snares of Satan, and the al- 
lurements of the world; rejoice in the 
finished work of Christ, depend upon 
the gracious influence of the Spii'it, that 
we may keep up a sense of the divine 
favour, and be longing for heav en, where 
we hope at last to join the general as- 
sembly of the first-born. 

77/(' advantages arising from the Jiar- 
ticipation of the Lord's su/iper are nu- 
merous. 1. It is a mean of strengthening 
our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. — 2. It 
affords great consolation and joy. — 3. It 
increases love. — 4. It has a tendency to 
enlighten our minds in the mystery of 
godliness. — 5. It gives us an utter aver- 
sion to all kinds of sin, and occasions a 
hearty grief for it. — 6. It has a tendency 
to excite and strengthen all holy desires 
in us. — 7. It renews our obligations to 
our Lord and Master. — 8. It binds the 
souls of Christians one to another. See 
Case's Sermons, ser. 7 ; and Henry 
Earle, Doolittle,.Grove, and Robertson^

Chamock's, Dr. Cudivorth's, Mr. Wil-

and Dr. Bell's, Pieces on the Subject, 
A variety of other treatises, explana-= 
tory of the nature and design of the 
Lord's supper, may be seen m almost 
any catalogue. 

Lot is a mutual agreement to deter- 
mine an inicertain event, no other ways 
determinable, by an appeal to the pro- 
vidence of God, on casting or throwing 
something. This is a decisory lot, Prov. 
xvi. 33. xviii. 18. The matter, there- 
fore, to be determined, in order to aA'oid 
g-uilt, should be important, and no other 
possible way left to determine it ; and 
the manner of making .the appeal so- 
lemn and grave, if we would escape the 
guilt of taking the name of God in vain. 
Wantonly, without necessity, and in a 
hidici'ous manner, to make this appeal, 
must be therefore highly blameable. 
And if thus the decisoiy lot, when wan- 
tonly and unnecessarily employed, be 
criminal, equally, if not more so, must 
the divinatory lot be, whicli is employ- 
ed for discovering the will of God : this 
being no mean of God's appointment, 
must be superstitious, and the height of 
presumption. 

LOVE consists in approbation of, and 
inclination towards an object that ap- 
pears to us as good. It has been distin- 
guished into, I. Love of esteem, v^hich 



LOV 



A2 



LOV 



arises from the mere consideration of I 
some excellency in an . object, and be- ] 
longs either to persons or thhigs. — 2. j 
JLove of beiievolt'jice, which is an inch- ! 
nation to seek the happiness or welfare 
of any thing. — 3. Love of comfitaccnce, 
which arises from the consideration of 
any object agreeable to us, and calcu- 
lated to afford us pleasure. 

LOVE TO GOD is a divine princi- 
ple implanted in the mind by the Holy 
Spirit, whereby we reverence, esteem, 
desire, and delight in Him as the chief 
good. It includes a knowledge of his na- 
tural excellences, Ps. viii. 1. and a con- 
sideration of his goodness to us, 1 .Tohn 
iv. 19. Nor can these two ideas, I think, 
be well separated; for, howev'er some 
may argue that genuine love to God 
should arise onlij from a sense of his 
amiableness, yet 1 think it will be diifi- 
cult to conceive how it can exist, ab- 
stracted from the idea of his relati\'e 
goodness. The passage last referred to 
is to the point, and the representations 
8;iven us of the praises of the saints in 
heaven accord with the same senti- 
ment : " Thou art worthy, for thoa hast 
redeemed us by thy blood," Rev., v. 9. 
See Self-Love. "Love to God is a 
suljject," says bishop Porteus, " which 
concerns us to inquh-e carefully into the 
ti-ue nature of. And it concerns us the 
more, because it has been unhappily 
brought into disrepute by the extrava- 
gant conceits of a few devout enthusiasts 
concerning it. Of these, some have 
treated the love of God in so refined a 
way, and carried it to such heights of 
seraphic ecstacy and rapture, that com- 
mon minds must for ever despair of 
either foUowiiig or understand'mg them ; 
whilst othei's have described it in such 
warm and indelicate terms as ai-e much 
better suited to the grossness of earthly 
passion than the jiurity of spiritual af- 
fection, 

" But the accidental excesses of this 
holy sentiment can be no just argurnent 
against its general excellence and utility. 

"We know that even friendsliip h- 
self has sometimes been abused to tlie 
most unworthy purposes, and led men to 
the commission of the most atrocious 
Crimes. Shall we, therefore, utterly dis- 
card that generous passion, and consider 
it as nothing more than the unnatural 
fervour of a romantic imagination? 
Everv heart revolts against so wild a 
thought I and wliy, then, must we sutFev 
the love of God to be banished out of 
the world, because it has been some- 
times iiflpro])erly represented or indis- 
■ erectly exercised? It is not cither from 
:!io visionaiw mystic, the sensual fana- 



tic, or the frantic zealot, but from the 
plain worcj of God, that we ar^to takc 
our ideas of this divine sent ment. There 
we find it described in all its native pu- 
rity and simplicitv. The mai'ks by 
which ■ it is there distinguished contain 
nothing enthusiastic or extravagant." It

LOVE, BROTHERLY, is affection 
to om- neighbours, and especially to the 
saints, prompting us to ev^ery -act of 
kindness tov,'ard them. It does not, ia- 
deed, consist merely in pity to and re- 
lief of others, 1 Cor. xiii. in love to our 
hen'factors ontv, and those who are re- 
lated to us. Matt. V. 46, 47. It must flow 
from love to God, and extend to all 
mankind ;■ yea, we are required by the 
highest authority to love e\'en our ene- 
mies. Matt. V. 44. not so as to counte- 
nance them in their evil actions, but to 
forgive the injuries they have done to- 
ns. Love to good men, also, must be 
particularly cidtivated, for it is the cora- 
maiid of Christ, John xiii. 34-; they be- 
long to the same Father and family, 
Gai. vi. 10 ; we hereby give proof of our 
discipleship, John xiii. '?&gt;5. The exam- 
ple of Christ should allure us to it, X 
John iii. 16. It is creative of a variety of 
pleasing sensations, and prevents a thou- 
S'lnd evils : it is the greatest of all graces, 
1 Cm-, xiii. 13. — It answers the end of 
the law, 1 Tim. i. 5 ; resembles thein- 
habitiuits of a better world, and with- 
out it every other attainment is of ho 
avail, 1 Cor. xiii. This love sliould show 
itself by praving for our brethi-en, Eph. 
vi. IS; bearing one anothex-'s bm-dens, 
by assisting and reiievipg- each , other, 



LOW 

Gal. vi. 2. By forbearing with one ano- 
ther, Col. iii. is. By reproving and ad- 
monishing in the spirit of meekness,

other in the truth ; by conversation, ex- 
hoitation, and stirring up one another to 
the several duties of religion, both pub- 
lic and pi'ivate, Jude 20, 21. Heb. x. 24, 
25. See Charity. 

LOVE OF GOD, is either his natu- 
ral delight in that which is good. Is. Ixi. 
8. or that especial affection he bears to 
his people, 1 John iv. 19. Not that he 
possesses the passion of love as we do ; 
but it- implies his absolute purpose and 
will to deliver, bless, and save his peo- 
ple. The love of God to his people ap- 
pears in his all^wise designs and plans 
for their happiness, Eph. iii. 10. — 2. In 
the choice oi them and determination 
to sanctify and glorify them, 2 Thess. ii. 
13. — 3. In the gift of his Son to die for 
them, and redeem them from sin, death, 
and hell, Rom. v. 9. John iii. 16. — 4. In 
the revelation of his will, and the decla- 
ration of his promises to them, 2 Pet. i. 
4. — 5. In the awful punishment of their 
enemies, Ex. xix. 4. — 5. In his actual 
conduct towards them ; in supporting 
them in life, blessing them in death, and 
bringing them to glory, Rom. viii. 30, 
&amp;c. Rom. vi. 23. The properties of this 
love may be considered as, 1. Everlast- 
ing, Jer. xxxi. 3. Eph. i. 4. — 2. Immu- 
table, Mai. iii. 6. Zeph. iii. 17. — 3. Free ; 
neither the sufferings of Christ nor the 
merits of men are the cause, but hi.s 
own good pleasure, John iii. 16. — 4. Great 
and unspeakable, Eph. ii. 4, 6. iii. 19. 
Psal. xxxvi. 7. 

LOVE, Family of. A sect that arose 
in Holland, in the sixteenth century, 
founded- by Henry Nicholas, a West- 
phalian. He maintained that he had a 
commission from heaven to teach men 
that the essence of religion consisted in 
the feelings of divine love ; that all other 
theological tenets, whether they related 
to objects of faith or modes of worship, 
were of no sort of moment ; and, con- 
sequently, that it was a matter of the 
most perfect indifference what opinions 
Christians entertained concerning the 
divine nature, pro\ided their hearts 
burned with the pure and sacred flame 
of piety and love.

LOW CHURCHMEN, those who 
disapproved of the schism made in the 
I'hurch by the non-jurors, and who dis- 
tinguished themselves by their modera- 
tion towards Dissenters, and were less 
ardent in extending the limits of eccle- 



313 LUK . 

siastical authority. See High Church- 
men. 

LUCIANISTS, or Lucanists, a 
sect so called from Lucianus, or Luca- 
nus, a hei'etic of the second century, be- 
ing a disciple of Marcion, whose errors 
he followed, adding some new ones to 
them. Epiphanius says he abandoned 
Marcion, teaching that people ought 
not to marry, for fear of enriching the 
Creator : and yet other authors mention, 
that he held this error in common with 
Marcion and other Gnostics. He denied 
the immortality of the soul, asserting it 
to be material. 

There was another sect of Lucianists, 
who ajTpeai'ed some time after the Ari- 
ans. Tliey taught, that the Father liad 
been a Father always, and that he had 
the name even before he begot the Son, 
as having m him the power and faculty 
of generation ; and in this manner they 
accoimted for the eteniitv of the Son. 

LUCIFERIANS, a sect who adher- 
ed to the schism of Lucifer, bishop of 
Cagliara, in the fourth century, ^\'ho was 
banished by the emperor Constantius, 
for having defended the Nicene doctrine 
concerning the three persons in the 
Godhead. It is said, also, that they be- 
lieved the soul to be corporeal, and to 
be transmitted from the father to the 
children. The Luciferians were nume- 
rous in Gaul, Spain, Egypt, &amp;c. The 
occasion of tliis schism was, that Luci- 
fer would not allow any acts he had 
done to be abolished. There were but 
two Luciferian bishops, but a great num- 
ber of priests and deacons. The Luci- 
ferians bore a great aversion to the 
Arians. 

LUKEWARMNESS, applied to the 
affections, indifference, or want of ardor. 
In respect to religion, hardly any thing 
can be more culpable than this spirit. — ■ 
If there be a God possessed of unspeak- 
able rectitude in his own nature, and 
unbounded goodness towards his crea- 
tures, what can be more inconsistent 
and unbecoming than to be frigid and 
indifferent in our devotions to him i 
Atheism, in some respects, cannot be 
worse tlwn lukewarnmess. The Atheist 
disbelieves the existence of a God, and 
therefore cannot worsl\ip him at all; 
the lukewarm owns the existence, sove- 
reignty, and goodness of the Supreme 
Being, but denies him that fervour of 
affection, that devotedness of heart, and 
activity of service, which the excellen- 
cy of his nature demands, and the au- 
thority of his word requires. Such a 
character, thei-efore, is represented as 
absolutely loathsome to God, and ob- 
noxious to his wrath. Rev iii. 15, 16'.

LUT

LUT 



T/ie general signs of a lukrnvarm spi- 
rif are such as these : Neglect of ])ri- 
vate prayer; a preference of worldly 
to religious company ; a lax attendance 
on public ordinances ; omission or care- 
less penisal of God's word ; a zeal for 
some appendages of religion, while lan- 
guid about religion itself ; a backward- 
ness to promote the cause of God in 
the world, and a rashness of spirit in 
censuring those who are desirous to be 
useful. 

If we inquire the causes of such a 
spirit, we shall find them to be — world- 
ly prosperity ; the influence of carnal 
relatives and acquaintances : indulgence 
of secret sins ; the fear of man ; and 
sitting imder an unfaithful ministry. 

The inconsistency of it appears if we 
consider, that it is highly unreasonable ; 
dishonourable to God; incompatible 
Avith the genius of the Gospel ; a barrier 
to improvement ; a death-blow to use- 
fulness ; a direct opposition to the com- 
mands of Scripture; and tends to the 
greatest misery. 

To overcome such a state of mind, we 
should consider how offensive it is to 
God: how incongruous with the very 
idea and nature of true religion ; how 
injurious to peace and felicity of mind ; 
how ungrateful to Jesus Christ, whose 
whole life was labour for us and our 
salvation ; how grievous to the Holy 
Spirit; how di'eadful an example to 
those who have no religion; how un- 
like the saints of old, and even to our 
enemies in the worst of causes ; how 
dangerous to our immortal souls, since 
it is indicative of our want of love to 
God, and exposes us to just condemna- 
tion, Amos VI. 1. 

LUTHERANS, those Christians who 
follow the opinions of Martin I^uther, 
the celebrated reformer of the church, 
in the sixteenth century. In order 
that we may trace the rise and pro- 
gress of Lutheranism, we must here re- 
fer to the life of Luther himself. Lu- 
ther was a native of Eisleben, in Saxony, 
and bom in 1483. Though his parents 
were poor, he received a learned edu- 
cation, during the progress of which he 
gave many indications of uncommon 
vigour and acuteness of genius. As his 
mind was naturally susceptible of serious 
impressions, and tinctured with some- 
what of that religious melancholy which 
delights in the solitude and devotion of 
a monastic life, he retired into a convent 
of Augustinian friars ; where he ac- 
quired great reputation not only for 
piety, but for love of knowledge, and 
unwearied appli.Mtion to study. The 
cause of this retirement is said to have 



been, that he was once stnick by light- 
ning, and his companion killed by his 
side by the same flash. He had been 
taught the scholastic philosophy which 
was in vogue in those days, arid made 
considerable progress in it; but hap- 
pening to find a copy of the Bible which 
lay neglected in the libraiy of his monas- 
tery, he applied himself to the stxidy of 
it with such eagerness and assiduity, as 
quite astonished the monks ; and in- 
creased his reputation for sanctity so 
much, that he was chosen professor, 
first of philosophy, and afterwards of 
theology, in W ittemburg, on the Elbe, 
where Frederic, elector of Saxony, had 
founded an uni\'ersity. ^ 

While Luther continued to enjoy the 
highest reputation for sanctity and leam- 
mg, Tetzel, a Dominican friar came to 
Wittembui'g in order to publish indul- 
gences. Luther beheld his success with 
great concern ; and having first inveigh- 
ed against indulgences from the pulpit, 
he afterwards published ninety-five the- 
ses, containing his sentiments on that 
subject. These he proposed not as points 
fully established, but as subjects of in- 
quiry and disputation. He appointed a 
day on which the learned were invited 
to impugn them, either in person or by 
writing ; and to the whole he subjoined 
solemn protestations of his high respect 
for the apostolic see, and of his implicit 
submission to its authority. No opponent 
appeared at the time prefixed : the the- 
ses spread over Germany with astonish- 
ing rapidity, and were read with the 
greatest eagerness. 

Though Lutlier met with no opposi- 
tion for some little time after he began 
to publish his new doctrines, it was not 
long before many zealous champions 
arose to defend those opinions with 
which the wealth and power of the 
clergy were so strictly connected. Their 
cause, hoAvever, was by no means pro- 
moted by these endeavours : the people 
began to call in question even the au- 
thority of the canon law, and of the pope 
himself. The court of Rome at first de- 
spised these new doctrines and disputes ; 
but at last the attention of the pope be- 
ing raised by the great success of the 
reformer, and the complaints of his ad- 
versaries, Luther was summoned, in the 
month of July, 1518, to appear at Rome, 
within sixty days, before the auditor of 
the chamber. One of Jjuther's adversa- 
ries, named Prierius, who had written 
against him, was appointed to examine 
his doctrines, and to decide concerning 
them. The pope wrote at the same 
time to the elector of Saxony, beseech- 
ing him not to protect a man whose he- 



LUT 



315 



I.UT 



retical and profane tenets were so shock- 
ing to pious eai-s; and enjoined the pro- 
vincial of the Augustmians to check, by 
his authority, the rashness of an arro- 
gant monk, which brought disgrace 
upon their order, and gave offence and 
disturbance to the whole church. 

From these letters, and the appoint- 
ment of his open enemy Prierius to be 
his judge, Luther easily saw what sen- 
tence he might expect at Rome; and 
therefore discovered the utmost solici- 
tude to have his cause tried in Germa- 
ny, and before a less suspected tribunal. 
He wrote a submissive letter to the 
pope, in which he promised an unreserv- 
ed obedience to his will, for as yet he 
entertained no doubt of the divine ori- 
ginal of the pope's authority ; and, by 
the intercession of the other professors, 
Cajetan, the pope's legate in Germany, 
was appointed to hear and determine 
the cause. Luther appeai'ed before him 
without hesitation ; but Cajetan thought 
it below his dignity to dispute the point 
with a person so much his inferior in 
rank ; and therefore required him, by 
virtue of the apostolic powers witli 
which he was clothed, to retract the er- 
rors which he had uttered with regard 
to indulgences and the nature of faith, 
and to abstain for the future from the 
publication of new and dangerous opi- 
nions ; and, at the last, forbade him to 
appear in his presence, unless he pro- 
mised to comply with what had been 
required of him. 

This haughty and violent manner of 
pi'oceeding, together with some other 
circumstances, gave Luther's friends 
such strong reasons to suspect that even 
the imperial safe-conduct wovdd not be 
able to protect him from the legate's 
power and resentment, that they pre- 
vailed on him secretly to withdraw from 
Augsburg, where he had attended the 
legate, and to return to his own coun- 
try. But before his departure, accoi-d- 
ing to a form of which there had been 
some examples, he prepared a solemn 
appeal from the legate, ill-informed at 
tnat time concerning his cause, to the 
pope, when he should receiye more full 
intimation with respect to it. Cajetan, 
enraged at Luther's abinipt retreat, and 
at the publication of his appeal, wrote 
to the elector of Saxony, complaining of 
both ; and requiring him, as he regarded 
the peace of the church, or the authori- 
ty of its head, either to send that sedi- 
tious monk a prisoner to Rome, or to 
banish him out of his territories. Fre- 
deric had hitherto, from political mo- 
tives, protected Luther, as thinking he 
might be of use in checking the enor- 



mous power of the see of Rome ; and 
tliough all Germany resounded with his 
fame, the elector had never yet admit- 
ted him into his presence. But upon 
this demand made by the cardinal, itlbe- 
came necessary to throw off some of his 
former reserve. He had been at great 
expense, and bestowed much attention 
on founding a new university, an object 
of considerable importance to every 
German prince ; and foreseeing how 
fatal a blow the removal of Luther 
would be to its reputation, he not only 
declined complying with either of the 
pope's requests, but openly discovered 
great concern for Luther's safety. 

The situation of our reformer, in the 
mean time, became daily more and 
more alarming. He knew very well 
what wei-e the moti\'^s which induced 
the elector to afford him protection, and 
that he could by no means depend on a 
continuance of his friendship. If he 
should be obliged to quit Saxony, he 
had no other asylum, and must stand 
exposed to whatc\-er punishment the 
rage or bigotry of his enemies could in- 
flict ; and so ready were his adversaries 
to condemn him, that he had been de- 
clared a heretic at Rome before the ex- 
piration of the sixty days allowed hini 
m the citation for making his appear- 
ance. Notwithstanding all this, how- 
ever, he discovered no symptoms of ti- 
midity or remissness ; but continued to 
vindicate his own conduct and opinions, 
and to inveigh against those of his ad- 
versaries with more vehemence than 
ever. Being convinced therefore, that 
the pope would soon proceed to the 
most violent measures against him, he 
appealed to a general council, which he 
affirmed to be the representative of the 
Catholic church, and superior in power 
to the pope, who, being a fallible man, 
might err, as St. Peter, the most perfect 
of his predecessors had done. 

The court of Rome was equally assi- 
duous, in the mean time, to cinish the 
author of these new doctrines, which 
gave them so much uneasiness. A bull 
was issued by the pope, of a date prior 
to Luther's appeal, in which he magni- 
fied the virtues of indulgences, and sub- 
jected to the heaviest ecclesiastical cen- 
sures all who presum.ed to teach a con- 
traiy doctrine. Such a clear decision 
of the sovereign pontiff against him 
might have been very fatal to Luther's 
cause, had not the death of the emperor 
Maximilian, which happened on Janua- 
ry 17, 1519, contributed to give matters 
a different turn. Both the principles 
and interest of Maximilian had prompt- 
ed him to support the authority of tho 



LUT

LUT 



see of Rome ; but, in consequence of his 
death, the vicariate of that party of Ger- 
many whicli is governed by the Saxon 
laws devolved to the elector of Saxony ; 
and, under the shelter of his friendly ad- 
ministration, Luther himself enjoyed 
ti-anquUhtv ; and his opinions took such 
root ill different places, that they could 
never afterwards be eradicated. At the 
same time, as the election of an em]ie- 
ror was a point more interesting to the 
pope (Leo X.) than a theological con- 
troversy which he did not understand, 
and of which he could not foresee the 
consequences, he was so extremely soli- 
citous not to irritate a prince of such 
considerable influence in the electoral 
college as Frederic, that he discovered 
a great un^villingness to pronounce the 
sentence of excommunication against 
Luther, which his adversaries continual- 
ly demanded with the most clamorous 
importunity. 

From the reason just now given, and 
Leo's natural aversion to severe mea- 
sures, a suspension of proceeding against 
Luther took place for eighteen months, 
though perpetual negociations were car- 
ried on during this interval, in order to 
bring the matter to an amicable issue. 
The manner m which these were con- 
ducted having given our reformer many 
opportunities of observing the com-uption 
of the court of Rome, its obstinacy in 
adhering to established errors, and its in- 
difference about truth, however clearly 
proposed or strongly proved, he began, 
in 1520, to utter some doubts with re- 
gard to the divine original of the papal 
authority, which he publicly disputed 
ivith Eccius, one of his most learned 
and formidable antagonists. The dis- 
pute was indecisive, both parties claim- 
(.ng the victory ; but it must have been 
very mortifying to the partizans of the 
Romish church to hear such an essen- 
tial point of their doctrine publicly at- 
tacked. • 

The papal authority being once sus- 
pected, Luther proceeded to push on 
his inquiries and attacks from one doc- 
trine to another, till at last he began to 
shake the firmest foundations on ^vhich 
the wealth and power of the church 
wei'C established. Leo then began to 
perceive that there were no hopes of re- 
claiming such an incorrigible heretic, 
and therefore prepared to pronounce 
the sentence of excommunication against 
Mm. The college of cardinals was often 
assembled, in order to prepare the sen- 
tence with due deliberation ; and the 
ablest canonists were consulted liow it 
might be expressed with unexcep- 
tkiua^le formality. At last it was issued 



on the loth of June, 1520. Forty-one 
propositions, extracted out of Luther's 
works, were therein condemned as he- 
retical, scandalous, and offensive to pi- 
ous ears ; all persons were forbidden to 
read his writings, upon pain of excom- 
munication ; such as had any of them 
in their custody were commanded to 
commit them to the flames; he himself, 
if he did not within sixty days publicly 
recant his errors, and bum his books, 
was pronounced an obstinate heretic, 
excommunicated, and delivered to Sa- 
tan for the destniction of the flesh ; and 
all secular princes were required, un- 
der pain of incurring the same censure, 
to seize his person, that he might be 
punished as his crimes desei'ved. 

Luther was not m the least discon- 
certed by this sentence, which he had 
for some time expected. He renewed 
his appeal to this general council ; de- 
clared the pope to be that antichrist or 
man of sin whose appearance is fore- 
told in the New Testament ; declaimed 
against his tyranny with greater vehe- 
mence than ever ; and at last, by way 
of retaliation, having assembled all the 
professors and students in the university 
of Wittemburg, with great pomp, and 
in the presence of a vast multitude of 
spectators, he cast the volumes of the 
canon law, together with the bull of ex- 
communication, into the flames. The 
manner in which this action was justi- 
fied, gave still more offence than the ac- 
tion itself. Having collected from the 
canon law some of the most extravagant 
propositions with regard to the pleni- 
tude and omnipotence of the pope's pow- 
er, as well as the subordination of all se- 
cular jurisdiction to his authority, he 
published these with a commentaiy, 
pointing out the impiety of such tenets, 
and their evident tendency to subvert all 
civil government. 

On the accession of Charles V. to 
the empii-e, Luther found himself in a 
very dangerous situation. Charles, in 
oi'der to secure the pope's friendship, 
had determined to treat him with great 
severity. His eagerness to gain tliis 
point rendered him not averse to gratify 
the papal legates in Germany, who in- 
sisted, that, \Yithout any delay, or for- 
mal deliberation, the diet then sitting at 
Worms ought to condemn a man whom 
the pope had already excommunicated 
as an incorrigible heretic. Such an 
atirupt manner of proceeding, howevei", 
being deemed unprecedented and unjust 
by the members of the diet, they made 
a point of Luther's appearing m person, 
and declaring whether he adhered or 
not to those opinions which had drawn 



LUT 



317 



LUT 



upon him the censures of the church. 
Not only the emperor, but all the princes 
through whose territories he had to 
pass, granted him a safe-conduct ; and 
Charles wrote to him at the same time, 
requiring his immediate attendance on 
the diet, and renewing liis promises of 

Erotection from any iiijury or violence, 
uther did not hesitate one moment 
about yielding obedierice; and set out 
for Worms, attended by the herald who 
had brought the emperor's letter and 
safe-conduct. While on his journey, 
many of his friends, whom the fate of 
Huss under similar circumstances, and 
notwithstanding the same security of an 
imperial safe-conduct, filled with solici- 
tude, advised and entreated him not to 
i-ush wantonly into the midst of danger. 
But Luther, superior to such ten-ors, 
silenced them with this reply : " I am 
lawfully called," said lie, "to appear 
in that city : and thither 1 will go, m 
the name of the Lord, though as many 
devils as there are tiles on the houses 
were there combined against me." 

The reception which he met with at 
Worms was such as might have been 
reckoned a full reward ot all his labours, 
if vanity and the love of applause had 
been the principles by which he was in- 
fluenced. Greater crowds assembled 
to behold him than had appeared at the 
emperor's public entry ; his apartments 
were daily filled with princes and per- 
sonages of the highest rank ; and he 
was treated with an homage more sin- 
cere, as well as more flattering, thtm 
any which pre-eminence in birth or 
condition can command. At his ap- 
pearance before the diet he behaved 
with great decency and with equal firm- 
ness. He readily acknowledged an ex- 
cess of acrimony and vehemence in his 
controversial writings; but refused to 
retract his opinions, unless he were con- 
vinced of their falsehood, or to consent 
to their being tried by any other rule 
than the word of God. W hen neither 
threats nor entreaties could prevail on 
him to depart from this resolution, some 
of the ecclesiastics proposed to imitate 
the example of the council of Constance ; 
and, by punishing the author of this pes- 
tilent heresy, who was now in their 
power, to deliver the church at once 
from such an evil. But the members 
of tlie diet refusing to expose the Ger- 
man integrity to fresh reproach by a 
second violation of public faith, and 
Charles being no less unwilling to bring 
a stam upon the beginning of his ad- 
ministration by such an ignominious 
action, Luther was permitted to de- 
part in safety, A tew days after he 



left tlie city, a severe edict was publish- 
ed in the emperor's name, and by au- 
thority of the diet, depriving him, as an 
obstinate and excommunicated criminal, 
of all the privileges which he enjoyed as 
a subject of the empire ; forbidding any 
prince to harbour or protect him ; ani 
requiring all to seize his person as soon 
as the term specified in his protection 
should be expired. 

But this rigorous decree had no con- 
siderable effect ; the execution of it be- 
ing- prevented partly by the multiplicity 
of occupations which the commotions in 
Spain, together with the wars in Italy 
and the Low Countries, created to the 
emperor ; and partly by a prudent pre- 
caution employed by the elector of Sax- 
ony, Luther's faithful patron. As Luther, 
on \iis return from W orms, was passing 
near Altenstrain, in Thui'ingia, a num- 
ber of horsemen, in masks, rushed sud- . 
denV out of a wood, where the elector 
had (appointed them to lie in wait for 
himj and, surrounding his company, car- 
ried'him, after dismissing all his attend- 
ants! to Woi-tJ:)urg, a strong castle, not 
far Aistant. There the elector ordered 
himto iie supplied with every thing ne- 
cessary or agreeable ; but the place of 
his ittreat was carefully concealed, un- 
til tile fury of the piesent storm against 
him began to abate, upon a change in 
the political system of Europe. In this 
sjlitude, where he remained nine 
months, and which he frequently called 
.lis Patmos, after the name of that _ 
island to which the apostle John was ' 
banished, he exerted his usual vigour 
and industry in defence of his doctrines, 
or in confutation of his adversaries ; pub- 
lishing several treatises, which revived 
the ■ipirit of his followers, astonished to a 
gre».t degree, and disheartened at the 
sucMen disappearance of their leader. 

Luther, weary at length of his retire- 
ment, appeared publicly again at Wit- 
'.enibuig, upon the 6th of March, 1522. 
He appeared, indeed, without the elec- 
tor's leave ; but immediately wrote 
tiim a letter to prevent him taking it 
ill. The edict of Charles V. severe as 
it vas had little or no check to Lu- 
ther's doctrine ; foi- the emperor was 
no sooner gone into Flanders, than his 
edict was neglected and despised, and 
the doctrine seemed to spread even 
faster than before. Carolostaduis, in 
Luther's fibsence, had pushed things on 
faster than his leader, and had attempt- 
ed to abolish the use of mass, to remove 
images out of the churches, to set aside 
auricular confession, invocation of saints, 
the abstaining from meats ; had allowed 
the monks to leave the monasteries, to 



LUT 



318 



LUT 



jieglect their vows, and to marry ; in 
short, had quite changed the doctrine 
and discipline of the church at Wittem- 
burg, all which, though not against Lu- 
ther's sentiments, was yet blamed by 
him, as being rashly and unseasonably 
done. Lutheranism was still confined to 
Germany ; it was not to go to France ; ' 
andHem-y VIII. of England made the 
most rigorous acts to hinder it from in- 
vading his realm. Nay, he did some- 
thing more : to show his zeal for reli- 
gion and the holy see, and perhaps his 
skill in theological learning, he wrote 
a treatise Of the Seve?i Sacraments, 
against Luther's book Of the Cafitnity 
of Babylon, which he presented to Leo' 
X. in October, 1521. The pope received 
it very favourably, and was so veil 
pleased with the king of England, that 
lie complimented him with the title of 
Defender of the Faith. Luther, how- 
ever, paid no regard to his kingship, 
but answered him with great sharpness, 
treating both his jierson and perfcrm- 
ance in the most contemptuous mamer. 
Henry complained of Luther's nide 
usage of him to the princes of Saxony : 
and Fisher, bishop of Rochester, replied 
to his answer, in belialf of Henry's frea- 
tise ; but neither the king's comj^laint, 
i!or the bi;i)ioi)'s reijlj, were atteiidal 
witli any a isible effects. 

Luther, though he had put a stop tp 
the violent proceedings of Carolostat'ius, 
now made open war on the ])oi)e and 
bishops; and, that he might make die 
j)eople despise their authority as micli 
as jiossible, lie wrote one l)ook aganst 
the pope's Indl, and another against the 
order falsely called tlie Order of Bi- 
aho/ts. The same year, 1522, he wrote 
a letter, dated July the 29th, to the as- 
sembly of the states of Bohemia; in 
A\ hich he assured them that he wa^ la- 
bouring to establish tlieir doctrine in 
&lt;iermany, and exhoiled them not to re- 
turn to the communion of the churcl; of 
Rome ; and he published also this year 
a translation of the New Testament in, 
the (ierman tongue, which was after- 
waixls corrected by himself and Me- 
laiictlion. I'liis translation ha\ ing been 

{iruited several times, and being in e\ery 
)ody's hands, Ferdinand, archduke of 
Austria, the emperor's brother, made a 
\ ery severe edict, to hinder the farther 
])ub'lication of it; and forbade all the 
subjects of his Imperial Majesty to have 
any copies of it, or of Luther's other 
books. Some other princes followed his 
cxamjile ; and Luther was so angi-y at 
it, that he wrote a treatise Of the Secu- 
lar Power, in which he accuses thtni of 
tyranny and impiety. The diet of the 



empire was held at Nuremberg, at the 
end of the year to which Hadrian VI. 
sent his brief, dated November the 25th ; 
for Leo X. died upon the 2d of Decem- 
ber, 1521, and Hadrian had been elected 
{lope upon the 9th of January following, 
n his brief, among other things, he ob- 
serA'es to the diet how he had heard, 
with grief, that Maitin Luther after the 
sentence of Leo X. which was ordei'ed 
to be executed by the edict of Worms, 
continued to teach the same errors, and 
daily to publish books full of heresies-, 
that it appeared sti*ange to him that so 
large and so religious a nation could be 
seduced by a wretched apostate friar ; 
that nothing, however, could be more 
pernicious to Christendom ; and that, 
therefore, he exhorts them to use their 
utmost endeavours to make Luther, 
and the authors of those tumults, return 
to their duty ; or, if they refuse, and 
continue obstinate, to proceed against 
them according to the laws of the em- 
pire, and the severity of the last edict. 

The resolution of this diet was pub- 
lished in the form of an edict, upon tlie 
6th of March, 1523; but it had no ef- 
fect in checking the Lutherans, who 
still went on in the same triumphant 
manner. This year Luther wi'ote a 
great many pieces; among the rest, one 
upon tlie dignity and oflice of the su- 
jireme magistrate; which Frederick, 
elector of Saxony, is said to have been 
highly pleased with. He sent, about 
the same time, a writing in the Ger- 
man language to the W'aldenses, or 
Pickards, in Boliemia and Moravia, who 
had applied to liim " about M'orshi])ping 
the body of Christ in the eucharist. " 
He wrote, also, another book, which he 
dedicated to the senate and people of 
Prague, "about the institution of mi- 
nisters of the church." He drew up a 
form of saying mass. He wrote a piece, 
entitled, l/i?i Examfile of popish Doc- 
trine and Divinity ; which Dupin calls 
a satire against nuns, and those luho 
profess a monastic life. He wrote also 
against the vows of virginity, in his pre- 
face to his commentary on 1 Cor. viii. 
and his exhortations here were it seems, 
followed with effect ; for, soon after, nine 
nuns, among whom was Catherine de 
Bore, eloped from the nunnery at 
Nimptschen, and were brought, by the 
assistance jof Leonard Coppen, a bur- 
gess of Torgau, to V\''ittemburg. V^'hat- 
ever offence this proceeding might give 
to the Papists, it was highly extolled by 
Luther ; who, in a book written in the 
German language, compares the deli- 
verance of these nuns from the slavery 
of monastic life to that of the souls

which Jesus Christ has delivered by his 
death. This year Luther had occasion 
to canonize two of his followers, who, 
as Melchior Adam relates, were burnt 
at Brussels, in the beginning of July, 
und were the first who suffered mart}-r- 
dom for his doctrine. He wrote also a 
consolatoiy letter to • thi-ee noble ladies 
at Misnia, who were banished from the 
duke of Saxony's court at Friburg, for 
reading his books. 

In the beginning of the year 1524, 
Clement VII. sent a legate into Ger- 
many to the diet which was to be held 
at Nuremberg. Hadrian VI. died in 
October 1523, and was succeeded by 
Clement upon the 19th of November. 
A little before his death, he canonized 
Benno, who was bishop of Meissen, in 
the time of Gregory VII. and one of the 
most zealous defendei-s of the holy see. 
Luthei', imagining that this was done 
dii'ectly to oppose him, drew up a piece 
with this title, Against the iieiv idol and 
old devil set up at Meissen, in which he 
treats the memory of Gregory with 
great freedom, and does not spare even 
Hadrian. Clement VII's legate repre- 
sented to the diet of Nuremberg the ne- 
cessity of enforcing the execution of the 
edict of Worms, which had been strange- 
ly neglected by the princes of the em- 
pire ; but, notwithstanding the legate's 
solicitations, which were very" pressing, 
the decrees of that diet were thought so 
ineflFectual, that they were condemned 
at Rome, and rejected by the emperor. 

In October, 1524, Luther flimg off the 
monastic habit ; which, though not pre- 
meditated and designed, was yet a very 
proper preparative to a step he took the 
year after : we mean his marriage with 
Cathei'ine de Bore. 

His marriage, however, did not retard 
his activity and diligence in the work of 
reformation. He revised the Augs- 
burg confession of faith, and apology for 
the Protestants, when the Protestant 
religion was first established on a firm 
basis. See Protestants and Refor- 
mation. 

After this, Luther had little else to do 
than to sit down and contemplate the 
mighty work he had finished ; for that 
a single monk should be able to give 
the church so rude a shock, that there 
needed but such another entirely to 
overturn it, may veiy well seem a 
mighty work. He did indeed, little 
else; for the remainder of his life was 
spent in exhorting princes, states, and 
imiversities, to confirm the reformation 
which had been brought about through 
him ; and publishing from time to time 
such writings as might encourage, di- j 



rect and aid them in doing it. The em- 
peror threatened temporal punishnaent 
with armies, and the pope eternal -yv^ith 
bulls and anathemas ; but Luther cilred 
for none of their threats. 

In the year 1533, Luther wrote a con- 
solatory epistle to the citizens of Os- 
chatz, who had suffered some hard- 
ships for adhering to the Augsburg 
confession of faith ; in which, among 
other things, he says, " The devil is the 
host, and the world is his inn ; so that 
where\ er you come, you will be store to 
find this ugly host." 'He had also about 
this time a terrible controversy with 
George duke of Saxony, who had such 
an a^'ersion to Luther's doctrine, that he 
obliged his subjects to take an oath that 
they would never embrace it. How- 
e\ er, sixty or seventy citizens of Leip- 
sic were found to ha-'C deviated a httle 
from the Catholic way in some pcont or 
other, and they were known previously 
to have consulted Luther about it ; upon 
which George complained to the elec- 
tor John, that Lutlier had noli only 
abused his person, but also preiached 
up rebellion among his subjects. The 
elector ordered Luther to be acquainted 
witli this ; and to be told, at the same 
time, that if he did not acquit himself of 
this charge, he could not possibly escape 
punishment. But Luther easily Refuted 
the accusation, by proving, that he had 
been so far from stirring up his ^ibjects 
against him on the score of I'eligion, 
that, on the contrary, he had ejihorted 
them rather to undergo the greatest 
hardships, and even suffer themselves 
to be banished. 

In the year 1534, the Bible, translated 
by him into German, was first printed, 
as the old privilege, dated Biliiopolis, 
under the elector's hand, shows; and it 
was published the same year. He also 
published this year a book against mass- 
es, and the consecration of priests, in 
which he relates a conference Ihe had 
with the devil upon those points; for it 
is remarkable in Luther's whole history, 
that he never had any conflicts of any 
kind withui, but the devil was always 
his antagonist. In February, 1537, an 
assembly was held at Smalkald about 
matters of religion, to which Luther and 
Melancthon were called. At this meet- 
ing Luther was seized with so grievous 
an illness, that there were no -hopes of 
his recovery. He was afflicted with the 
stone, and had a stoppage of urine for 
eleven days. In this terrible condition 
he would needs undertake tt travel, 
notwithstanding all that his friends could 
say or do to prevent him : his resolu- 
tion, however, was attended with s 



LUT

LUT 



good effect ; for the night after his de- 
parture he began to be better. As he 
was carried along he made his will,, in 
which he bec^neathed his detestation of 
popery to his friends and brethren ; 
agreeably to what he used to say : Pestis 
cram viviis, jnorkns ero mors tua, Jia- 
/la ; that is, " I was the plague of po- 
pery in my life, and shall continue to be 
so in my death." 

This year the pope and the court of 
Rome, finding it impossible to deal with 
the Protestants by force, began to have 
recourse to stratagem. They affected, 
therefore, to think, that tliough Luther 
had, indeed, carried things on with a 
high hand, and to a violent extreme, 
yet what he had pleaded in defence of 
these measures was not entirely with- 
out foundation. They talked with a 
seeming show of Moderation; and Pius 
III. who succeeded Clement VII. pro- 
posed a reformation first among them- 
selves, and even went so far as to fix a 
place for a council to meet at for that 
pui-pose. But Luther treated this farce 
as it deserved to be treated ; unmasked 
and detected it immediately ; and, to 
ridicule it the more strongly, caused 
a picture to be drawn, in which was re- 
presented the pope seated on high upon 
a throne, some cardinals about him with 
foxes' ".ails on, and seeming to evacuate 
upwards and downwards, (sursum de- 
orsmn repnri(are, as Melchior Adam 
expresses it.) This was fixed over 
against the titlepage, to let the reader 
see at once the scope and design of the 
book ; which was to expose that cun- 
ning and artifice v/ith which these sub- 
tle politicians affected to cleanse and pu- 
rify themselves from their errors and 
superstitions. Luther published, about 
the same time, a confutation of the pre- 
tended grant of Constantine to Sylves- 
ter, bishop of Rome ; and also some 
letters of John Huss, written from his 

firison at Constance to the Bohemians. 
n this manner was Luther employed 
till his death, which happened in the 
year 1546. 

A thousand lies were invented by the 
Papists about Luther's death. Some 
said that he died suddenly ; otliers, that 
he killed himself ; others, that the de- 
vil strangled him : others, that his corpse 
stunk so abominably, that they were 
forced to4eave it in the way, as it was 
carried to be interred. Nay, lies were 
invented about his death, even while he 
was yet alive. Luther, however, to give 
the most effectual refutation of this ac- 
count of his death, pat forth an adver- ' 
tisement of his being alive ; and, to be j 
even with the Papists for the malice I 



they had sliown in this lie, wrote a book 
at the same time to prove, that " the 
papacy was founded by the devil." 

Lutheranism has undergone some al- 
terations since the time of its foundef. 
Luther rejected the epistle of St. James 
as inconsistent with the doctrine of St. 
Paul in relation to justification ; he also 
set aside the Apocalypse : both of which 
are now received as canonical in the 
Lutheran church. 

Luther reduced the number of sacra- 
ments to two, viz. baptism and the eu- 
charist ; but he believed the impanation, 
or consubstantiation ; that is, that the 
matter of the bread and wine remain 
with the bod)" and blood of Christ ; and 
it is in this article that the main dif- 
ference between the Lutheran and the 
EngUsh churches consists. 

Luther maintained the mass to be no 
sacrifice : exploded the adoration of the 
host, auricular confession, meritorious 
works, indulgences, purgatory, the wor- 
ship of images, &amp;c. which had been in- 
troduced in the corrupt times of the 
Romish church. He also opposed the 
doctrine of free will, maintained predes- 
tination, and asserted our justification 
to be solely by the imputation of the 
merits and satisfaction of Christ. He 
also opposed the.fastings of the Romish 
church, monastical vows, the celibate of 
the clergy*, &amp;c. 

The Lutherans, however, of all Pro- 
testants, are said to differ least from the 
Romish church ; as they affirm that the 
body and blood of Christ are materially 
present in the sacrament of the Lord s 
supper, though in an incomprehensible 
manner ; and likewise to represent some 
religious rites and institutions, as the use 
of images in churches, the distinguishing 
vestments of the clergy, the private con- 
fession of sins, the use of wafers in the 
administration of the Lord's supper, the 
form of exorcism in the celebration of 
baptism, and other ceremonies of the 
like nature, as tolerable, and some of 
them as useful. The Lutherans main- 
tain with regard to the divine decrees, 
that they respect the salV'ation or mi- 
sery of men, in consequence of a pre- 
vious knowledge of their sentiments and 
characters, and not as free and uncon- 
tinual, and as founded on the mere will 
of God. Towards the close of the se- 
venteenth century, the Lutherans be;;; 
gan to entertain a greater liberality of 
sentiment than they had before adopted ; 
though in many places they persevered 
longer in severe and despotic principles 
than other Protestant churches.^ Their 
public teachers now enjoy an unbounded 
liberty of dissenting from the decisions

of those symbols or creeds which were 
once deemed almost mfallible rules of 
faith and practice, and of declaring their 
dissent in the manner they judge the 
most expedient. Mosheim attributes 
this change in their sentiments to the 
maxims which they generally adopted, 
that Christians were accountable to God 
alone for their religious opinions; and 
that no individual could be justly pun- 
ished by the magistrate for his erro- 
neous opinions, while he conducted him- 
self like a virtuous and obedient subject, 
and made no attempts to distui'b tl:e 
peace and order of civil society. In 
Sweden the Lutheran church is epis- 
copal: in Norway the same. In Den- 
mark, under the name of superintendent, 
all episcopal authority is I'etamed ; 
whilst thi'ough Germany the superior 
power is vested in a consistory, over 
which there is a president, with a dis- 
tinction of rank and privileges, and a 
subordination of inferior clergy to their 
superiors, different from the parity of 
Presbyterianism. Mosheim^s F.ccles.

LUXURY, a disposition of mind ad- 
dicted to pleasure, not, and superfluities. 
Luxury implies a giving one's self up 
to pleasure ; voluptuousness, an indul- 
gence in the same to excess. Luxury 
may be farther considered as consisting 
in. 1. Vain and useless expenses. — 2. In 
a parade beyond what people can afford. 
— 3. In affecting to be above our own 
rank.~4. In living in a splendour that 
does not agree with the puljlic good. In 
order to avoid it, we sliould consider 
that it is ridiculous, troublesome, sinful, 
and ruinous. Robi?iso7i's Claude, vol. i. 
p. 382; Ferguson on Society, part., vi. 
sec. 2. 

LYING, speaking falsehoods wilfully, 
with an intent to deceive. Thus, by 
Grove, " A lie is an affirngation or de- 
nial by words, or any jptlier signs to 
which a certain determinate meaning is 
affixed, of something contrary to our 
real thoughts and intentions." Thus, by 
Paley, "a lie is a breach of promise: 



for whoever seriously addresses his dis- 
course to another, tacitly promises to 
speak the truth, because he knows that 
the ti'uth is expected." There are va- 
rious kinds of lies. 1. The pernicious lie, 
uttered for the hurt or disadvantage of 
our neighbour. — 2. The officious lie, 
uttered tor our own or our neighbour's 
advantage. — 3. The ludicrous and jo- 
cose lie, uttered by way of jest, and only 
for mirth's sake in common converse. — ■ 
4. Pious frauds as they are improperly 
called, pretended inspirations, forged 
books, counterfeit miracles, are species 
of lies. — 5. Lies of the conduct, for a lie 
may be told in gestures as well as in 
words ; as when a tradesman shuts up 
his windows to induce his creditors to 
believe that he is abroad. — 6. Lies of 
omission, as when an author wilfully 
omits what ought to be related : and 
may we not add, — 7. That all equivoca,- 
tion and mental reservation come un- 
der the guilt of lying. The evil and in- 
justice of lying appear, 1. From its be- 
ing a breach of the natural and univer- 
sal right of mankind to truth in the in- 
tercourse of speech. — 2. From its being 
a violation of God's sacred law, Phil. iv. 
8-. Lev. xix. 11. Col. iii. 9.-3. The fa- 
culty of speech was bestowed as an in- 
stniment of knowledge, not of deceit ; 
to communicate our thoughts, not to 
hide them. — 4. It is esteem ?'d a re- 
proach of so heinous and hateful a na- 
ture for a man to be called a liar, that 
sometimes the life and blood of the slan- 
derer have paid for it. — 5. It has a ten- 
dency to dissolve all society, and to in- 
dispose the mind to religious impressions- 
— 6. The punisliment of it is considera- 
ble : the loss of ci-edit, the hatred of 
those whom we have deceived, and an 
eternal separation from God in the 
world to come, Rev. xxi. 8. Rev. xxii, 
15. Psalm ci. 7. See Equivocation.—

to those who adopted the sentiments of 
Macarius, a native of Ireland, who 
about the close of the ninth century, 
propagated in France the tenet after- 
wards maintamed by Averrhoes, that 
one individual intelligence or sonl per- 
formed the spiritual and rational func- 
tions in all the human race. 

MACEDONIANS, the followers of 
Macedonius, bishop of Constantinople, 
who, through the influence of the Euno- 
mians, was deposed by the council of 
Constantinojjle in 360, and sent into 
exile. He considered the Holy Ghost 
as a divine energ}- diffused throughout 
the universe, and not as a person dis- 
tinct from the Father and the Son. The 
sect of the Macedonians was crushed 
before it had arrived at its full maturity, 
by the council assembled by Theodosius 
in 381, at Constantinople. See Semi- 

ARIANS. 

MACHIAVELIANISM, the doc- 
trine or principles of Machiavel, as laid 
down in his treatise entitled Tlie Prince, 
and which consists in doing any thuig to 
compass a design, Avithout any regard to 
the peace or welfare of subjects, the 
dictates of honesty and honour, or the 

Erecepts of religion. This work has 
een tr?.nslated into many languages, 
and wrote against by many authors, 
tliough the world is not agreed as to the 
motives of the writer; some thinking 
he meant to recommend tyrannical 
maxims ; others, that he only delineated 
them to excite abhorrence. • 

MAGDALEN, religions of St. a de- 
nomination given to divers communities 
of nuns, consisting generally of penitent 
courtezans; sometimes also called Mag- 
dalaneites. They were established at 
Mentz in 1542 ; at Paris in 1492 ; at Na- 
ples in 1324; at Rouen and Bordeaux 
m 1618. In each of these monasteries 
there were three kinds of persons and 
congregations; the first consisted of 
those who were admitted to make vows, 
and those bear the name of St. Magda- 
len ; the congregation of St. IVIartha 
was the second, and was^ composed of 
those whom it was not thought proper 
to admit to vows finally ; the con§a-ega- 
tion of St. Lazarus was composed of 
such as were detained by force. The 
rehgious of St. Magdalen at Rome were 
established by Pope Leo X. Clement 
VIII. settled a revenue on them ; and 
farther appointed, that the effects of all 

Eulilic prostitutes dying intestate should 
dl to them ; and that the testaments of 
the rest should be invalid, unless they 
bequeathed a portion of their effects, 
which was to be at least a fifth part of 
them. 



MAGI, or Magians, an ancient re- 
ligious sect of Persia and other eastern 
colmtries, who, abominating the adora- 
tion of images, worshipped God only by 
fire, in which tliey were directly oppo- 
site to the Sabians. See Sabians. The 
Magi believed that tliere were two 
principles, one the cause of all good, 
and the other the cause of all evil ; in 
which opinion they were followed by 
the sect of the Manichees. See Mani- 
CHEES. They called the good princi- 
ple Jazden, aiid Orinuzd, and the evil 
principle ./2?/;?-a7?m72 or ylher man. The 
former was by the Greeks called Oro- 
masdrs, and the latter Arimanius. The 
I'eason of their worshipping Jire was, 
because they looked upon it as the tru- 
est symbol of Oro7nasdes, or the good 
god; as darkness was of Arimanius, or 
the evil god. In ail their temples they 
had fire continually burning upon their 
altars, and in their "own private houses. 
The religion of the Magi fell into dis- 
grace on the death of tliose ringleaders 
of that sect who had usurped the sove- 
reignty after tlie death of Cambyses; 
and the slaughter that was made of the 
chief men among them sunk it so low, 
that Sabianism every where prevailed 
against it ; Darius and most of his fol- 
lowers on that occasion going over to it. 
But the aP" ction which the people had 
for the religion of their f(n-efathers not 
being easily to be rooted out, the fa- 
mous impostor Zoroaster, some ages 
after, undertook to re\'ive and reform 
it. 

The chief reformation this pretended 
prophet made in the Magian religion 
was in the first principle of it ; for he 
introduced a god superior both to Oro- 
masdes and Arimanius. Dr. Prideaux 
is of opinion that Zoroaster took the 
liint of this alteration in their theology 
from the prophet Isaiah, who brings in 
God, saying to Cyrus king of Persia, / 
am the Lord, and there is none else: I 
form the light, and create darkness ,- / 
make peace ag.d create euil, ch. xlv. 7. 
In short, Zoroaster held that thei-e was 
one supreme independent Being, and 
under him two principles, or angels; 
,one the angel of light or good, and the 
other the angel ot evil or darkness; 
that there is a perpetual struggle be- 
tween them, which shall last to the end 
of the world ; that then the angel of 
darkness and his disciples shall go into 
a world of their own, where they shall 
be punished in everlasting darkness; 
and the angel of light and his disciples 
shall also go into a world of their own, 
where they shall be rewarded in ever- 
lasting light.

Zoroaster was the first who built Jire- 
temjilcs; the Magians before his 'time 
pertbiTiiing their devotion on the tops 
of hills and in the open air, by which 
means they were exposed to the incon- 
venience of rain and tempests, which 
often extmguished their sacred fires. 
To procure the greater veneration for 
these sacred fires, he pretended to have 
received fire from heaven, which he 
placed on the altar of the first fire-tem- 
ple he erected, which was that of Xin, 
in Media, from whence they say it was 
propagated to all the rest. The Ma- 
giau priests kept their sacred fire with 
the greatest diligence, watching it day 
and night, and never suffering it to be 
extinguished. They fed it only with 
Avood btript of the bart, and they never 
l&gt;lowed it with their breath or with bel- 
lows, for fear of polluting it ; to do ei- 
ther of these was death by their law. 
The Magian religion as reformed by 
Zoroaster, seems m many things to be 
built upon the plan of the Jewish. The 
Jews had their sacred fire which came 
down from heaven upon the altar of 
burnt offerings, which they never suf- 
fered to go out, and with which all their 
sacrifices and oblations were made. Zo- 
I'oaster, in like manner, pretended to 
have brought his holy fire from heaven ; 
and as the Jews had a Shckbiah of the, 
divine presence among them, resting 
over the mercy seat in the Holy of Ho- 
lies, Zoroaster likewise told his Ma- 
gians to look upon the sacred fire in 
their temples as a Shckhiah, in which 
God especially dwelt. — From these and 
some other instances of analogy between 
the Jewish and the Magian religion, 
Prkieaux infers that Zoroaster had been 
first educated and bi'ought up m the 
Jewish religion. 

The priests of the Magi were the 
most skilful mathematicians and philo- 
sophers of the age in which they lived, 
insomuch that a learned man and a 
Magian became equivalent terms. This 
proceeded so far, that the vulgar, look- 
ing on their knowledge to be more than 
natural, imagined they were inspired by 
some supernatural power. And hence 
those who practised wicked and diabo- 
lical arts, taking upon themselves the 
name of Magians, drew on it 'that ill sig- 
nification which the word Magician now 
bears among us. 

The Magian priests were all of one 
tribe ; as among the Jews, none but the 
son of a priest was capable of,bearing 
that office among them. The rpval fa- 
mily among the Persians, as long as this 
sect subsisted, was always of the sacer- 
dotal tribe. They were divided into 



three orders; the inferior clergy, the 
superintendents, or bishops, and the 
archimagTis, or arch-pi'iest. 

Zoroaster had the address to bring 
over Darius to his new-reformed reli- 
gion, notwitlistanding the strongest op' 
position of the Sabians ; and from that 
time it became the national religion of 
all that country, and so continued for 
many ages after, till it was supplanted 
by that of Mahomet. Zoroaster com- 
posed a book containing the principles 
of tlie Magian religion. It is called 
Zeiidavesta, and by contraction Zend. 
See Zend. 

MAGIC, a science which teaches to 
produce sui-prising and extraordinary 
effects ; a correspondence with bad spi- 
rits, by means of which a person is able 
to perform surprising things. This was 
strictly forbidden by the law of God, on 
pain of death, I^ev. xix. 31. 

MAGISTER DISCIPLINE, or 
Master of Discipline, the appella- 
tion of a certain ecclesiastical officer in 
the ancient Christian church. It was a 
custom in some places, particularly in 
Spain, in the time of the Gothic kings, 
about the end of the fifth century, ior 
parents to dedicate their children very 
young to the service of the church. For 
this ijuri)ose they were taken into the 
bishop's family, and educated under 
him by some grave and discreet person 
whom the bishop deputed for that pur- 
pose, and set over them, by the name of 
Frenbyttr or Magisttr Discijilinde, 
v/hose chief business it was to inspect 
their behaviour, and instruct them in 
the rules and discipline of the church.

MAHOMET ANISM, the system of 
religion formed and propagated, by Ma- 
homet, and still adhered to by His fol- 
lowei's. It is professed by the Turks 
and Persians, by several nations among 
the Africans, and many among the East 
Indians. 

iVIaliomet was bom in the reign of 
yVnushii'wan the Just, eniperor ot Per- 
sia, about the end of the sixth century 
of the Christian era. He came into the 
world under some disadvantages. His 
father Abd'allah was a younger son of 
Abd'almotalieb ^ and dying very young', 
and in his father's life-time, left his wi- 
dow and ail infant son in very mean chv

cumstances, his whole subsistence con- 
sisting but of five camels and one Ethio- 
pian she slave. Abd'almotalleb was 
therefore obliged to take care of his 
grandchild Mahomet; which he not 
only did during his life, but at his death 
enjoined his eldest son Abu Taleb, who 
was brother to Abd'allah by the same 
mother, to pi-ovide for him for the fu- 
ture ; which he very affectionately did, 
and insti-ucted him in the business of a 
merchant, which he followed ; and to 
that end he took him into Syria, when 
)ie was but thirteen. He afterwards 
recommended him to Khadijah, a noble 
and rich widow, for her factor ; in whose 
service he behaved himself so well, that 
by making him her husband, she soon 
raised him to an equality with the richest 
in Mecca. 

After he began by this advantageous 
match to live at his ease, it was, that he 
formed the scheme of establishing a new 
religion, or, as he expressed it, of re- 
plantmg the only true and ancient one 
professed by Adam, Noah, Abraham, 
Moses, Jesus, and all the prophets, by 
destroying the gross idolatiy into which 
the generality of his countrymen had 
fallen, and weeding out the corruptions 
and superstitions which the latter Jews 
and Christians had, as he thought, in- 
troduced mto their religion, and re- 
ducing it to its original purity, which 
consisted chiefly in the worship of one 
God. 

Before he made any attempt abroad, 
he rightly judged tliat it was necessary 
for him to begin with the conversion of 
his own household. Having, therefore, 
retired with his family, as he had done 
several times before, to a cave in mount 
Kara, he there opened the secret of his 
mission to his wife Khadijah ; and ac- 
quainted her, that the angel Gabriel 
had just before appeared to him, and 
told him that he was appointed the 
apostle of God: he also repeated to her 
a passage Avhich he pretended had been 
revealed to him by the ministry of the 
angel, with those other circumstances 
of this first appearance which are rela- 
ted by the Mahometan writers. Kha- 
dijah received the news with great joy, 
swearing by Him in whose hands her 
soul was, that she trusted he would be 
the prophet of his nation ; and imme- 
diately communicated wliat she had 
heard to her cousin Warakah Ebn 
Nawfal, v/ho, being i Christian, could 
write in the Hebrew character, and was 
tolerably well versed in the Scriptures ; 
and he readily came into her opinion, 
assuring her that the sam." aa^^el vvlio 
Jiad foTHierly appeared unto Moses was 



now sent to Mahomet. The first over- 
ture the prophet made was in the month 
of Ramadiui, in the fortieth year of his 
age, which is therefore usually called 
the year of his mission. 

Encouraged by so good a beginning, 
he resolved to proceed, and try for some 
time what he could do by private per- 
suasion, not daring to hazard the whole 
affair by exposing it too suddenly to the 
public. He soon made proselytes of 
those under his own roof, viz. his wife 
Khadijah, his servant Zeid Ebn Hare- 
tha, to whom he gave his freedom on 
that occasion (which afterwards became 
a rule to his followers,) and his cousin 
and pupil Ali, the son of Abu Taleb, 
though then very* young : but this last, 
making no account of the other two, 
used to stvle himself the first of be- 
lievers. The next person Mahomet ap- 
plied to was Abd'allah Ebn Abi Kohara, 
surnamed Abu Beer, a man of great 
authority among the Koreish, and one 
whose interest he well knew would be 
of great sei-vice to him ; as it soon ap- 
peared; for Abu Beer, being gained 
over, prevailed also on Othman Ebn 
Affan, Abd'alraham Ebn Awf, Saad 
Ebn Abbi Wakkus, At Zobeir al Awam, 
and Telha Ebn Obeid'allah, all princi- 
pal men of Mecca, to follow his exam- 
ple. These men were six chief com- 
panions, who, with a few more, were 
converted in the space of three years : 
at the end of which Mahomet having 
as he hoped, a sufficient interest to sup- 
port him, made his mission no longer a 
secret, but gave out that God had com- 
manded him to admonish his near rela- 
tions ; and in order to do it with more 
convenience and prospect of success, he 
directed Ali to prepare an entertain- 
ment and invited the sons and descen- 
dants of Abd'almotalleb, intending then 
to open his mind to them. — This was 
done, and about forty of them came ; 
but Abu Laheb, one of his uncles, ma- 
king the company break up before Ma- 
homet had an opportunity of speaking, 
obliged him to give them a second in- 
vitation the next day ; and when they 
were come, he made them the following 
speech : " I know no man in all Ara- 
bia who caji offer his kindred a more 
exellent thing than I now do to you ; I 
offer you happiness both in this life, and 
in that which is to come : God Almighty 
hath commanded me to call you unto 
him. Who, therefore, among you will 
be assistant to me herein, and become 
my brother and my vicegerent .•"' All of 
them hesitating and declining the mat- 
ter, Ali at length rose up, and declared 
that he would be his assistant, and ve-

hemently threatened those who should 
oppose him. Mahomet upon this em- 
braced All with great demonstrations of 
affection, and desired all who ^yere pre- 
sent to hearken to and obey him as his 
deputy; at which the company broke 
out into a great laughter, telling Abu 
Taleb that he must now pay obedience 
to his son. 

This repulse, however, was so far 
from discouraging Mahomet, that he 
began to preach in public to the people, 
who heard him with some patience, till 
he came to upbraid them with the ido- 
latry, obstmacy, and perverseness of 
themselves and their fathers ; which so 
highly provoked them, that they de- 
clared themselves his enemies; and 
would soon have procured his ruin, had 
he not been protected by Abu Taleb. 
The chief of the Koreish warmly soli- 
cited this person to desert his nephew, 
making frequent remonstrances against 
the iimovations he was attempting : 
which proving ineffectual, tliey at 
length threatened him with an open 
mpture if he did not prevail on Maho- 
met to desist. At this Abu Taleb was so 
far moved, that he earnestly dissuaded 
his nephew from pursuing the affair iiny 
farther, representing the great danger 
that he and his friends must otherwise 
run. But Mahomet was not to be in- T 
timidated ; telling his uncle plainly, that 
if they set the sun agahist him on his 
right hand, and the moon on his left, he 
would not leave his enterfirise : and 
Abu Taleb, seeing him so firmly re- 
solved to proceed, used no farther ar- 
guments, but promised to stand by him 
against all his enemies. 

The Koreish, finding they could pre- 
vail neither by fair words nor menaces, 
tried what they could do by force and 
ill treatment ; usuig Mahomet's follow- 
ers so very injuriously, that it was not 
safe for them to continue at Mecca any 
longer ; whereupon Mahomet gave leave 
to such of them as had no friends to 
protect them to seek for refuge else- 
where. And accoi'dingly, in the fifth 
year of the prophet's mission, sixteen 
of them, four of whom were women, 
fled into Ethiopia; and among them 
Othman Ebn Affan, and his wife Ra- 
kiah, Mahomet's daughter. This was 
the first flight ; but afterwards several 
others followed them, retiring, one af- 
ter another, to the number of eighty- 
three men, and eighteen women, be- 
sides children. These refugees were 
kindly received by the Najashi, or king 
of Ethiopia, who refused to deliver 
them up to "those whom the Koreish 
sejat, to demand them, and, as the Arab 



writers unanimously attest, even pro- 
fessed the Mahometan religion. 

In the sixth year of his mission, Ma- 
homet had the pleasure of seeing his 
party strengthened by the. con version of 
his uncle Hamza, a man of great valour 
and merit ; and of Omar Ebn al Kattab, 
a person highly esteemed, and once a 
violent opposer of the prophet. As per- 
secution generally advances rather than 
obstructs the spreading of a religion, 
Islamism made so gi-eat a progress 
among the Arab tribes, that the Koreish, 
to suppress it effectually if possible, in 
the seventh year of Mahomet's mis- 
sion, made a solemn league or covenant 
against the Hashemites, and the family 
ot Abd'almotalleb, engaging themselves 
to contract no marriages with any of 
them, and to have no communication 
with them ; and to give it the greatei- 
sanction, reduced it into writing, and 
laid it up in the Caaba. Upon this the 
tribe became divided into two factions ; 
and the family of Hasham all repaired 
to Abu Taleb, as their head; except 
only Abd'al Uzza, surnamed Abu La- 
heb, who, out of inveterate hatred to 
his nephew and his doctrine, went over 
to the opposite party, whose chief was 
Abu Sosian Ebn Harb, of the famDy of 
Ommeya. 

The families continued thus at va- 
riance for three years ; but in the tenth 
year of his mission, Mahomet told his 
uncle Abu Taleb, that God had mani- 
festly showed his disapprobation of the 
lea^e which the Koreish had made 
against them by sending a worm to eat 
out every word of the instrument except 
tlie name of God. Of this accident 
Mahomet had probably some private 
notice ; for Abu Taleb went immediately 
to the Koreish, and acquainted therii 
with it; offering, if it proved false, to 
deliver his nephew up to them ; but, in 
case it were time, he insisted that they 
ought to lay aside their animosity, anil 
annul the league they had made against 
the Hashemites. To this they acqui- 
esced ; and, going to inspect the writing, 
to their gi'eat astonishment found it to 
be as Abu Taleb had said; and the 
league was thereupon declared void. 

In the same year Abu Taleb died at 
the age of above fourscore ; and it is th^ 
general opinion that he died an infidel ; 
though others say, that when he was at 
the point of death he embraced Maho- 
metanism, and produce some passages 
out of his poetical compositions to con- 
fii-m their assertion. About a month, 
or, as some write, three days after the 
death- of this great benefactor and pa- 
tron, Maliomet had the additional mor-

ftfication to lose his wife Khadijah, who 
had so generously made his fortune. For 
which reason this year is called the 
year of ?nourning. 

On the death of these two persons, 
the Koreish Began to be more trouble- 
some than ever to their prophet, and 
especially some who had formerly been 
his intimate friends ; insomuch that he 
found himself obliged to seek for shelter 
elsewhei'e, and first pitched upon Tayef, 
about sixty miles east from Mecca, for 
the place of his retreat. Thither, there- 
fore, he went, accompanied by his ser- 
vant Zeid, and applied himself to two 
of the chief of the tribe of Thakif, v/ho 
were the inhabitants of that place ; but 
they received him very coldly. How- 
evei", he staid there a month ; and some 
of the more considerate and better sort 
of men treated him with little respect; 
but the slaves and inferior people at 
length rose against him ; and bringing 
him to the wall of the city, obliged him 
to depart, and return to Mecca, vvhile 
he put himself under the protection of 
Al Motaani Ebn Adi. 

This repulse greatlv discouraged his 
followers. However, Mahomet was not 
wanting to himself; but boldly' continu- 
ed to preach to the public assemblies at 
the pilgrimage, and gained several pro- 
selytes ; and among them six of the in- 
habitants of Yathreb, of the Jewish tribe 
of Khaznij ; who, on their return home, 
failed not to speak much in recommen- 
dation. of their new religion, and exhort- 
ed their fellow-citizens to embrace the 
same. 

In the twelfth year of his mission it 
was that Mahomet gave out that he had 
made his night journey fi'om Mecca to 
Jerusalem, and thence to heaven, so 
much spoken of by all that write of him. 
Dr. Prideaux thinks he invented it either 
to answer the expectations of those who 
demanded some miracles as a proof of 
his mission; or else, by pretending to 
have conversed with God, to estabhsh 
the authority of whatever he should 
think fit to leave behind by way of oral 
tradition, and make his sayings to sene 
the same pui-pose as the oral law of tlie 
Jews. But it does itot appear that Ma- 
homet himself ever expected so great 
a regard should be paid to his sayings 
•hs his followers have since done ; and, 
seeing he all along disclaimed any pow- 
er of performing miracles, it seems ra- 
ther to have been a fetch of policy to 
raise his reputation, by pretending to 
have actually conversed with God in 
heaven, as Moses had heretofore done 
in the Mount, and to have received.seve- 
ral institutions immediately from him. 



whereas, before, he contented himself 
with persuading them that he had all 
by the mipistry of Gabriel. 

However, this story seemed so absurd 
and incredible, that several of his fol- 
lowers left him upon it ; and had proba- 
bly ruined the whole design, had not 
Alju Beer vouched for his veracity, and 
declared, that, if Mahomet affirmed it 
to be true, he verily believed the whole. 
Which happy incident not only retriev- 
ed the prophet's credit, but increased' it 
to such a degree, that he was secure of 
being able to make his disciples swallow 
whatever he pleased to impose on them 
for the future. And this fiction, notwith- 
standing its extravagance, was one of 
the most artful contrivances Mahomet 
ever put in practice, and what chiefly 
contributed to the raising of his reputa- 
tion to that great height to which it af- 
terwards arnved. 

In this yeai', called by the Mahome- 
tans the accrhted year, twelve men of 
Yathreb or Medina, of whom ten were 
of the tribe of Khazraj, and the other 
two of that of the Aws, came to Mecca, 
and took an oath of fidelity to Mahomet 
at Al Akaba, a hill on the north of that 
city. This onth was called the ivo- 
?nan's oath; not that any women were 
present at this time, but because a man 
was not thereby obliged to take up arms 
in defence of Mahomet or his religion ; 
it being the same oatii that was after- 
wards exacted of the women, the form 
of which we have in the Koran, and is 
to this effect, viz. That they should 
renounce all idolatry; and that they 
should not steal, nor commit fornication, 
nor kill their children (as the pagan 
Arabs used to do when they apprehend- 
ed they should not be able to maintain 
them,) nor forge calumnies ; and that 
they should obey the pi'ophet in all 
things that were reasonable. vVlien they 
had solemnly engaged to all this, Ma- 
homet sent one of his disciples named 
Masab Ebn Omair home with them, to 
instmct them more fully in the grounds 
and ceremonies of his new religion. 

Masab, being arrived at Medina, by 
the assistance of those who had been 
formerly converted, gained several pro- 
selytes, particularly Used Ebn Hodeira, 
a chief man of the cit}', and Saad Ebn 
Moadh, prince of the tribe of Aws; Ma- 
hometanism spreading so fast, that there 
was scarce a house wherein there were 
not some who had embraced it. 

Tlie next year, being the thirteenth 
of Mahomet's mission, Masab returned 
to Mecca, accompanied by seventy- 
three men and two wom«i of Medina 
who had professed Islan*m, besides 



MAH 



327 



INTAH 



some others who were as yet unbeliev- 
ers. On their an-ival they immediately 
sent to Mahomet and offered him their 
assistance, of which he was now in great 
need ; for his adversaries were by this 
time grown so powerful in Mecca, that 
he could not stay there much longer 
without imminent danger. Wherefore 
he accepted their proposal, and met 
them one night, by appointment, at Al 
Akaba above-mentioned, attended by his 
uncle Al Abbas; who, thoif'gh he was 
not then a believer, v.'ished his nephew 
well, and made a speech to those of 
Medina ; whei'ein he told them, that, as 
Mahomet was obliged to quit his native 
city, and seek an asylum elsewhere, 
and they had offered liim their protec- 
tion, they would do well not to deceive 
him : that if they were not firmly resolv- 
ed to defend, and not betray him, they 
had better declare their minds, and let 
him provide for his safety in some other 
manner. Upon their protesting their 
sincerity, Mahomet swore to be faithhil 
to tfiem, on condition tliat they should 

firotect him against all insults as hearti- 
y as they would their own wives and 
families. They then asked him, wliat 
recompence they were to expect, if they 
sliould happen to be killed ni his quar- 
rel ? he answered, Paradise. Where- 
upon they pledged their faith to him, 
and so retui-ned home, after Mahomet 
had chosen twelve out of their number, 
who were to have the same authority 
among them as the twelve apostles of 
Christ had among his disciples. 

Hitherto Mahomet had propagated 
his religion by fair means ; so tliat the 
whole success of his enterprise, before 
his flight to Medina, must be attributed 
to persuasion only, and not to compul- 
sion. For before this second oath of 
fealty or inauguration at Al Akaba, he 
liad no permission to use any force at 
all ; and in se\-eral places of the Koran, 
which he pretended were revealed dur- 
ing his stay at Mecca, he declares his 
business was only to preach and admon- 
ish ; that he haiil no authority to com- 
pel any person to embrace his religion ; 
and that, whether people believe or not, 
was none of his concern, but belonged 
solely unto God. And he was so Tar 
from allowing his followers to use force, 
that he exhorted them to bear patiently 
those injuries which were offered them 
on account of their faith ; and, when 
persecuted himself, chose rather to quit 
the place of his birth, asid retire to Me- 
dina, than to make any resistance. But 
this great passiveness and moderation 
seem entirely owing to his want of pow- 
er, and the great superiority of his op- 



posers, for the first twelve years of his 
mission ; for no sooner was he enabled, 
by the assistance of those of Medina, to 
make head against his enemies, than he 
gave out, that God had allowed him 
and his followers to defend themselves 
against the infidels: and at length, as 
his forces increased, he pretended to 
have the divine leave even to attack 
tliem, and destroy idolatry, and set up 
the true faith by the sword; finding, 
by experience, that his designs would 
otherwise pi'ocecd very slowly, if they 
were not utterly overthrown; and know- 
ing, on tiie otlier hand, that innovators, 
when they depend solely on their own 
strength, and can compel, seldom nm 
any risk ; from whence, says Machiavel, 
it follows, that all the armed prophets 
have succeeded, and the unarmed ones 
have failed. Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, 
and Romulus, would not have been able 
to establish the observance of their in- 
stitutions for any length of time, had 
they not been armed. The first pas- 
sage of the Koran which gave Maho- 
met the permission of defending him- 
self by arms is said to have been that in 
the twenty-second chapter; after which, 
a great number to the same puipose 
Avcre revealed. 

Mahomet having provided for the 
security of his companions, as weil as 
his own, by the league offensive and 
defensive which he had now concluded 
with those of Medina, directed them to 
repair thither, which they accordingly 
did; but himself, with Abu Beer and 
Ali, staid behind, having not yet receiv- 
ed the divine permission as he pretend- 
ed, to leave Mecca. The Koreish, fear-, 
ing the consequence of this new alliance, 
began to think it absolutely necessary to 
prevent Mahomet's escape to Medina; 
and having held a council thereon, 
after several milder expedients had 
been rejected, they came to a resolution 
that he should be killed; and agreed 
tliat a man should be chosen out of 
every tribe for the execution of this de- 
sign ; and that each man should have a 
blow at him with his sword, that the 
guilt of his blood might fall equally on 
all the tribes, to whose united power the 
Hashemites were much inferior, and 
therefore durst not attempt to revenge 
their k'lsman^s death. 

This conspiracy was scarce formed, 
when, by some means or other, it came 
to Mahomet's knowledge ; and he gave 
out that it was revealed to him by thfe 
angel Gabriel, who had now ordered 
him to retire to Medina. Whereupon, ■ 
to amuse his enemies, he directed AI.i 
to r,^ do-vvn in his place, and wrap him-

self up in his green cloak, which he did ; 
and Mahomet escaped miraculously, as 
they pretend, to Abu Beer's house, un- 
perceived by the conspirators, who had 
already assembled at the prophet's door. 
They, in the mean time, looking through 
the crevice and seeing Ali, whom they 
took to be Mahomet himself, asleep, 
continued watching there till morning, 
when Ali arose, and they found them- 
selves deceived. 

From Abu Beer's house Mahomet 
and .he went to a cave in mount Thur, 
to the south-east of Mecca, accompanied 
onl\ by AmorPjbn Foheirah, Abu Beer's 
servant, and Abd'allah Ebn Oreitah, 
an idolater whom they had hired for a 
guide. In this cave they lay hid tliree 
days, to avoid the search of their ene- 
mies, which they very narrowly escaped, 
and not without the assistance of more 
miracles than one; for some say that 
the Koreish were stiiick with blindness, 
so that they could not find the cave ; 
others, that, after Mahomet and his 
companions were got in, two pigeons 
laid their eggs at the entrance, and a 
spider covered the mouth of the cave 
with her web, which made, them look 
no farther. Abu Beer seeing the pi-o- 
phet in such imminent danger, became 
ver}' sorrowful ; whereupon Mahomet 
comforted him with these words, re- 
corded m the Koran ; Be not griex^ed, 
for God is with us. Their enemies 
being retired, they left the cave, and 
set out for Medina by a bye-road ; and 
having fortimately, or, as the Mahome- 
tans tell us, miraculously, escaped some 
who were sent to pursue them, arrived 
safely at that city ; whither Ali followed 
them in three days, after he had settled 
some aflfairs at Mecca. 

Mahomet being securely settled at 
Medina, and able not only to defend 
himself against the insults of his ene- 
mies, but to attack them, began to send 
out small paities to make reprisals on 
the Koreish; the first party consisting 
of no more than nine men, who inter- 
cepted and plundered a caravan be- 
longing to that tribe, and ui the action 
took two prisoners. But what establish- 
ed his aflfairs \rery much, and was the 
foundation on which he built all his suc- 
ceeding greatness, was the gaining of 
tlie battle of Bedr, which was fought in 
the second year of the Hegira, and is 
so famous in the Mahometan history. 
Some reckon no less than twenty-seven 
Expeditions, wherein M-thomet was per- 
sonally present, in nine of which he 
gave battle, besides several other expe- 
(litions in which he was not present. 
His forces he maintained partly b; the 



contributions of his followers for tin? 
pui-pose, which he called by the name 
of zacat, or alms, and the paying of 
wljich he veiy artfully made one main 
article of his reUgioii ; and partly by 
ordering a fifth pai't of the plunder to 
be brought into the public treasury for 
that puipose, in which matter he like- 
wise pretended to act by the divine 
direction. 

In a fcAv years, by the success of his 
arms, notwithstanding he sometimes 
came off Avith the worst, he considera- 
bly raised his credit and power. In the 
sixth year of the Hegira he set out with 
1400 men to visit the temple of Mecca, 
not with any intent of committing hos- 
tilities, but in a peaceable manner. 
However, when he came to Al Hodei- 
biya, which is situated partly within and 

i)artly without the sacred tenitory, the 
ioreish sent to let him know that they 
would not permit him to enter Mecca, 
unless he forced his way : whereupon 
he called his troops about him, and they 
all took a solemn oath of fealty or ho- 
mage to him, and he resolved to attack 
the citv: but those of Mecca sending 
Arwa Ebn Masun, prince of the tribe' 
of Thakif, as their ambassador, to de- 
sire peace, a tnice was concluded be- 
tween them for ten years, by which any 
person was allowed to entei* into league 
either with Mahomet, or with the Ko- 
reish as he thought fit. 

In the seventh year of the Hegira, 
Mahomet began to think of propagat- 
ing his religion, beyond the bounds of 
Arabia, and sent messengers to the 
neighbouring princes, with letters to 
invite them to Mahometanism. Nor 
was this project without some success ; 
Khosru Farviz, then king of Persia, 
received his letter with great disd;i.in, 
and tore it in a passion, sending away 
the messenger very abniptly; whicli, 
when Mahomet heard, he said, God 
shall tear /lis kingdo7n. And soon after 
a messenger came to Mahomet from 
Badhan, king of Yaman, who was a de- 
pendent on the Persians, to acquamt 
him that he had received orders to send 
him to Khosru. Mahomet put off his 
answer till the next morning, and then 
told the messenger it had been revealed 
to him that night tliat Khosru was slain 
by his son Shiruyeh; adding, that he 
was well assured' his new religion and 
empire should rise to as gi'eat a height 
as that as Khosni ; and therefore bid 
him advise his master to embrace Ma- 
hometanism. The messenger being re-* 
turned, Badhan in a few days receivec. 
a letter from Shiruyeh, informing him 
of. his father's death, and ordering hin&gt; 



MAH

to give the prophet no farther disturb- 
ance. Whereupon Bashan, and the Per- 
sians with him, turned Mahometiuis. 

The emperor HeracUus, as the Ara- 
bian historians assure us, received Ma- 
homet's letter witli great respect, lay- 
ing it on his pillow, and dismissed the 
bearer hon(.)urably. And some pretend 
that he would have professed this new 
faith, had he not been afraid of losing 
his crown. 

Mahomet wrote to the same effect to 
the king of Ethiopia, though he had 
been converted before, according to the 
Arab writers ; and to Mokawkas, go- 
vernor of Egypt, who gave the messen- 
ger a very favourable reception, and 
sent several valuable presents to Ma- 
homet, and among the rest two girls, 
one of which, named Marv, became a 
great favourite with him. He also sent 
letters of the like pui-port to several 
Ai'ab princes; particularly one to Al 
Hareth Ebn AbiShamer, king of Ghas- 
san, who returning for answer that he 
would go to Mahomet himself, the pro- 
phet said. May his khigdom perish ; 
another to Hawdha Ebn Ali, king of 
Yamama, who was a Christian, and, 
having sometime before professed 
Islamism, had lately returned to his 
former faith : this prince sent back a 
very rough answer, upon which Ma- 
homet cursuig him, he died soon after ; 
and a third to Al Mondar Ebn Sawa, 
king of Bahrein, who embraced Ma- 
hometanism, and all the Arabs of that 
country followed his example. 

The eighth year of the Hegira was a 
very foitunate year to Mahomet. In 
the beginning of it Khaled Ebn al Wa- 
lid and Amru Ebn al As, both excellent 
soldiers, the first of whom afterwards 
conquered Syria and other countries, 
and the latter Egypt, became proselytes 
to Mahometanisni. And soon after the 
prophet sent 3000 men against the Gre- 
cian,forces, to revenge the death of one 
of his ambassadors who, being sent to 
the governor of Bosra on the same er- 
rand as those who went to the above- 
mentioned prhices, was slain by an 
Arab of the tribe of Ghassan, at Muta, 
a town hi the teiritory of Balka, in 
Syria, about three days journey east- 
ward from Jei-usalem, near which town 
they encountered. The Greciaris being 
vastly superior in number (for, including 
the auxiliary Arabs, thej- had an ai-m\- 
of 100,000 men,) the Mahometans were 
repulsed in the first attack, and lost 
successively three of their generals, viz. 
Zeib Ebn Haretha, Mahomet's freed- 
man; Jaasar, the son of Abu Talcb; 
and AbdaUah Ebn Rawalia : but Kha- 



lid Ebn al ^^'alid, succeeding to the 
command, overthrew the Greeks with 
great slaughter, and brought away 
abundance of rich spoil ; on occasion of 
which action Mahomet gave him the 
title of Scjf min soy uf Allah, "one of 
the swords of God." 

In this year also Mahomet took the 
city of Mecca, the inhabitants whereof 
had broken the truce concluded on two 
years before ; for the tribe of Beer, who 
were confederates with the Koreish, 
attacking those of Kozah, who were al- 
lies of Mahomet, killed several of them, 
behig supported in the action by a 
partv of the Koreish themselves. The 
consequence of this violation was soon 
apprehended, and Abu Sosian himself 
made a journey to Medina on purpose 
to heal the breach and renew the truce, 
but in vain ; for Mahomet, glad of 
this opportvmity, refused to see him: 
whereupon he applied to Abu Beer and 
Ali; but they givmg him no answer, 
he was obliged to return to Mecca as 
he came. 

Mahomet immediatelj'^ gave orders 
for preparations to be made that he 
might surprise the Meccans while they 
were unprovided to receive him; in a. 
little time he began his march thither; 
and by the time he came near the city, 
his forces were increased to ten thou- 
sand men. Those of Mecca not being 
in a condition to defend themselves 
against so foi-midable an army, surren- 
dered at discretion, and Abu Sosian 
saved his life by turning Mahometan. 
About tAventy-eight of the idolaters 
were killed by a party under the com- 
numd of Khaled ; but this happened con- 
trary to Mahomet's orders, who, when 
he entered the town, pardoned all the 
Koreish on their submission, except only 
six men and four women, who were 
more obnoxious than ordinary, (some of 
them having apostatized,)' and were 
solemnly proscribed by the prophet him- 
self: but of these no niore tlian one man 
and one wom.an were put to death, the 
rest obtaining pardon on their embrac- 
ing Mahometanisni, and one of the wo- 
men making her escape. 

The remainder of tliis year Mahomet 
employed in destroying the idols in and 
round Mecca, sending several of the 
generals on expeditions for that pur- 
pose, and to invite the Ai-abs to Jslam- 
ism ; wherein it is no wonder if they 
now met with success. 

The next j-ear being the ninth of -the 
Hegira, the Mahometans call the year 
of embassies ; for the Arabs had been 
hitherto expecting the issue of the wat- 
between Maliomet and the Koreisli ; 
T t

but, so soon as that tribe, the principal 
of the wlioie nation, and tlie genuine 
descendants of Ishmael, whose preroga- 
tives none offered to dispute, had sub- 
mitted, they were satisfied that it was 
not in their power to oppose Mahomet ; 
and therefore began to c©me in to him 
in great numbers, and to Send embassies 
to make their submission to him, both 
to Mecca, while he staid there, and also 
to Medina, whither he returned this 
year. Among the rest, five kings of 
the ti-ibe of Hamyar professed Maho- 
metanism, and sent ambassadors to no- 
tify the same. 

In the tenth year Ali was sent into 
Yaman to propagate the Mahometan 
faith there ; and, as it is said, converted 
the whole tribe of Hamdan in one day. 
Their example was quickly followed 
by all the inhabitants of that province, 
except only those of Najran,. who, being 
Christians, chose rather to pay tribute. 

Thus was Mahometanism establislied, 
and idolatry rooted out, even in Maho- 
met's life-time, (for he died the next 
year,) throughout all Arabia, except 
only Yamama, where Moseilama, who 
set up also as a prophet as Mahomet's 
competitor, had a great pai-ty, and was 
not reduced till the kalifat of Abu Beer : 
and the Arabs being tlien imited in one 
faith, and under one prince, found them- 
selves in a condition of making those 
conquests which extended the Maho- 
metan faith over so great a part of the 
world. 

1. Mahovietans, taiets of the. The 
Mahometans divide their religion into 
two general parts, faith and practice, 
of which the first is divided into six dis- 
tinct branches: Belief in God, in his 
angels, in his Scriptures, in his pro- 
phets, in the resurrection and final judg- 
ment, and in God's absolute Decrees. 
The points relating to practice are, 
prayer, with washings, &amp;c. alms, fast- 
mg, pilgrimage to Mecca, and circum- 
cision. 

Of the Mahometan faith, 1. That 
both Mahomet, and those among his 
followers who are reckoned orthodox, 
had and continued to have just and tiiie 
notions of God and his attributes, ap- 
pears so plain from the Koran itself, 
and all the Mahometan divines, that 
it would be loss of time to refute those 
who suppose the God of Mahomet to 
be different from tlie true God, and 
only a fictitious deity or idol of his own 
creation. 

2. The existence of angels and their 

i)urity, are absolutely required to be be- 
ieved in the Koran ; and he is reckoned 
an infidel who denies there are such 



j being.s, or hates any of them, or asserts 
any distinction of sexes among them. 
They believe them to have pure and 
subtle bodies, created of fire ; that they 
neither eat nor drink, nor propagate 
their species; that they have various 
forms and offices, some adoring God in 
different postures, others singing praises 
to him, or interceding for mankind. 
They hold, that some of them are em- 
ployed in writing down the actions of 
men ; others in carrying the throne of 
God, and other senices. 

3. As to the Scriptures, the Maho- 
metans are taught by the Koran, that 
God, in divers ages of the world, gave 
revelations of his will in writing to se- 
veral prophets, the whole and every one 
of which it is absolutely necessary for 
a good Moslem to beheve. The num- 
ber of these sacred books were, accord- 
ing to them, one hundred and four; of 
which ten were given to Adam, fiftj' to 
Seth, thirty to Edris or Enoch, ten to 
Abraham; and the other four, being 
the Pentateuch, the Psalms, the Gospel, 
and the Koran, were successively de- 
livered to Moses, David, Jesus, and 
Mahomet : which last being the seal of 
the prophets, those revelations are now 
closed, and no more are to be expected. 
All these diA ine books, except the four 
last, they agree now to be entirely lost, 
and their contents unknown ; though 
the Sabians have several books which 
they attribute to some of the antedilu- 
vian prophets. And of those four, 
the Pentateuch, Psalms, and Gospel, 
they say, ha\'e undergone so many 
alterations and corniptions, that, though 
there may possibly be some part of 
the tiTie word ot God therein, yet 
no credit is to be given to the present 
copies in the hands of the Jews and 
Christians. 

4. The number of the prophets which 
have been from time to time sent by 
God into the world, amounts to nft less 
than 224,000, according to one Maho- 
metan tradition ; or to 124,000, accord- 
ing to another; among whom 313 were 
apostles, sent with special commissions 
to reclaim mankind from infidelity and 
superstition ; and six of them brought 
new_ laws or dispensations, which suc- 
cessively abrogated the preceding: 
these were Adam, Noah, Abraham, 
Moses, Jesus, and Mahomet. All the 
prophets in general, the Mahometans 
believe to have been freed from great 
sins and errors of consequence, and 
professors of one and the same religion, 
that is, Islamism, notwithstanding the 
different laws and institutions which 
they observed. They allow of degrees

among them, and hold some of them to 
be more excellent and honourable than 
others. The first place they give to 
the revealers and establishei-s of ne^v 
dispensations, and the next to the 
apostles. 

In this great number of prophets 
they not only reckon divers patri- 
archs and persons named m Scripture, 
but not recorded to have been pro- 
phets (wherein the Jewish and Chris- 
tian writers have sometimes led the 
way,) as&gt; Adam, Seth, Lot, Ishmael, 
Nun, Joshua, 8cc. and mtroduced some 
of them under different names, as 
Enoch, Hcber, and Jethro, who ai'e 
called in the Koran, Edris, Hud, and 
Shoaib : but several others whose very 
names do not appear in Scripture 
(though they endeavour to find some 

Sersous there to fix them on,) as Selah, 
:hedr, Dhu'lkefl, &amp;c. 
5. The belief of a general resurrec- 
tion and a future judgment. 

The time of the resurrection the 
Mahometjuis allow to be a perfect se- 
cret to all but God alone; the angel 
Gabriel himself aknowledging his ig- 
norance in this point, when Mahomet 
asked him about it. However, they 
say, the appi'oach of that day may be 
known from ceitaui signs which are to 
precede it. 

After examination is past, (the ac- 
count of which is too long and tedious 
for this place,! and every one's work 
weighed in a just balance, they say, 
that mutual retaliation will follow, ac- 
cording to which every creature will 
take vengeance one of another, or have 
satisfaction made them for the injuries 
which they have suffered. And, since 
there will then be no other way of 
returning like for like, the manner of 
givuig this satisfaction will be by taking 
away a proportional part of the good 
works of him who offered the injur)', 
and adding it to those of him who suf- 
fered it. Which being done, if the an- 
gels (by whose ministry this is to be 
performed) say, Lord, nve have given 
to eveiy one his due, and there reinain- 
eth of this person'' s good ivorks so much 
as egualleth the weight of an ant, God 
Avill of his mercy, cause ii to be douliled 
unto him, that he may be admitted into 
Paradise ; but if, on the contrary, his 
good works be exhaixsted, and there re- 
main evil works only, and there be any 
who have not yet received satisfaction 
from him, God will order that an equal 
weight of their sins be added unto his, 
that he may be punished for them in 
their stead, and he will be sent to hell 
laden with both. This will be the method 



of God's deahng with mankind. As to 
brutes, after they shall have likewise 
taken vengeance of one another, he 
will command them to be changed into 
dust ; wicked men being reserved to 
more grievous punishment, so that they 
shall cry out, on hearing this sentence 
passed on the bi'utes, Woxdd to God 
that nve were dust also ! As to the genii, 
many Mahometans are of opinion that 
such of them as are time believers, will 
undergo the same fate as the irrational 
animals, and have no other reward than 
the fa\'0ur of being converted into dust ; 
and for this they quote the authority of 
their prophet. 

The trials being over, and the assem- 
bly dissohed, the Mahometans hold, 
that those who are to be admitted into 
Paradise will take the right hand way, 
and those who are destined into hell-fire 
will take the left : but both of them 
must first pass the bridge called hi 
Arabic ^l oirat, which, they say, is 
laid over the midst of hell, and describe 
to be finer than a hair, and sharoer than 
the edge of a sword ; so that it seems 
very difficult to conceive how any one 
shall be able to stand upon it ; for which 
reason most of the sect of the Mota- 
zalites reject it as a fable ; though the 
orthodox think it a sufficient proof of 
the tinith of this aiticle, that it was 
seriously affirmed by him who never 
asserted a falsehood, meaning their 
prophet ; who, to add to the difficulty 
of the passage, has likewise declared, 
that this bridge is beset on each side 
with briers and hooked thorns, which 
will, however, be no impediment to the 
good ; for they shall pass with wonder- 
ful ease and swiftness, like lightning, or 
the wind, Mahomet and his Moslems 
Icaduig the waj^ ; whereas the wicked, 
Avhat with the slipperiness and extreme 
narrowness of the path, the entangling 
of the thorns, and the extinction of the 
light which dii-ected the former to Pa- 
radise, will soon miss their footmg, and 
fall down headlong into hell, v^hich is 
gaping beneath them. 

As to the punishment of the wicked, 
the Mahometans are taught, that hell 
is di\ided into seven stories or apart- 
ments, one below another, designed for 
the i-eception of as many distinct classes 
of the damned. 

The first, which they call Jehenan, 
tliey say, will be the receptacle of those 
who acknowledged one God, that is, 
the wicked Mahometans; who, after 
havuig been punished according to their 
demerits, will at length be released; 
the second, named Ladha, they assign 
to the Jews; the third, named al Hota-

fiia, to the Christians ; the fourth, named 
al Sair, to the Sabians ; the fifth, named 
Sakar, to the Magians ; the sixth, na- 
med al Jahin, to the idohiters ; and the 
seventh, which is the lowest and Avorst 
of all, and is called al Hatvyat, to the 
hj'pocrJtcs, or those who outwardly 

Eixjfessed some religion, but in their 
earts were of none. Over each of these 
apartments they believe there will be 
set a guard of angels, nineteert in num- 
ber; to whom the danmed will confess 
the just judgment of God, and beg them 
to intercede with him for some allevia- 
tion of their pain, or that they may be 
delivered by being annihilated. 

Mahomet has, in his Koran and tra- 
ditions, been veiy exact in describing 
the various torments of hell, which, ac- 
cording to him, the wicked will suffer 
both fi'om intense heat and excessive 
cold. We shall, however, enter- into 
HO detail of them here ; but only ob- 
serve, that the degrees of these pains 
will also vary in proportion to the 
crimes of the sufferer, and the apart- 
ment he is condemned to ; and that he 
who is punished the most lightly of all 
will be shod with shoes of fire, the fer- 
vour of which will cause his skull to 
boil like a cauldron. The condition 
of these unhappy wretches, as the same 
prophet teaches, cannot be properly 
called either life or death; and their 
misery will be greatly increased by 
their despair of bemg ever delivered 
from that place, since, according to 
that frequent expi-ession in the Koran, 
they muHt remain therein for ever. It 
must be remarked, however, that the 
hifidels alone will be liable to eternity 
of damnation ; Ibj' the Moslems, or 
those who have embraced the true 
I'eligion, and have been giiilty of heinous 
sins, will be delivered thence after they 
shall have expiated thtir crimes by 
their sufferings. The time which these 
believers shall be detained there, ac- 
cording to a tradition handed down from 
their prophet, will not be less than nine 
hundred years, nor more than seven 
thousand. And, as to the manner or 
their delivery, they say that they shall 
be distinguished by the marks of pros- 
ti'ation on those parts of their bodies 
with which they used to touch the 
ground in prayer, and over which the 
fire will therefore have no power; and 
that, being knQwn by this characteristic, 
they will be released by the mercy of 
God, at the intercession of Mahomet 
and the blessed : whereupon th(-se who 
shall have been dead will be rest'red 
to life, as has been said: and those 
whose bodies shall have contracted any 



sootiness or filth from the flames and 
smoke of hell, will be immersed in one 
of the rivers of Paradise, called the 
River of lif; which will wash them 
whiter than pearls. 

The I'ighteous, as the Mahometans 
are taught to believe, having surmount- 
ed the difficulties, and passed the shaip 
bridge above-mentioned, before they 
enter Paradise, will be refreshed by 
drinking at the pond of their prophet, 
who describes it to be an exact square, 
of a month's journey in compass; its 
water, which is supplied by two pipes 
from al Cawthay, one ot the rivers 
of Paradise, being whiter than milk or 
silver, and more odoriferous than musk, 
with as many cups set around it as there 
are stars in the firmament; of which 
water whoever drinks will thirst no 
more for ever. This is the first taste 
which the blessed will have of their fu- 
ture and now near approaching felicity. 

Though Paradise be so very frequent- 
ly mentioned in the Koran, yet it is a dis- 
pute among the Mahometans, whether 
it be already created or to be created 
hereafter; the Motazalites and some 
other sectaries asserting, that there is 
not at present any such place in nature, 
and that the Paradise which the righ- 
teous will inhabit in the next life will 
Ije different from that from which Adam 
Avas expelled. However, the orthodox 
profess the contrary, maintaining that it 
was created even before the world, and 
describe it fi'om their prophet's tradi- 
tions in the following manner : 

They say it is situated above the 
seven neav'ens, (or in the seventh hea- 
ven,) and next under the throne of 
God ; and, to express the amenity of 
the place, tell us, that the earth of it is 
of the finest wheat-flour, or of the 
purest musk, or as others will have it, 
of saffron ; that its stones are pearls and 
jacinths, the walls of its building en- 
riched with gold and siher, and that 
the titinks of all its trees are of gold ; 
among which the most remarkable is 
the tree called tuba, or the tree of hap- 
piness. Concerning this tree, they fable, 
that it stands m the palace of Mahomet, 
though a branch of it will reach to the 
house of every tnie believer; that it 
will be laden with pomegranates, 
grapes, dates, and other fiiiits, of sur- 
prising bigness, and of tastes unknown 
to mortals. So that, if a man desire to 
eat of any particular kind of fruit, it 
will immediately be presented him ; 
or, if he choose flesh, birds ready 
di^sscd will be set before him, accord- 
ing to his wish. I'hey add, that the 
boughs of this tree will spontaneously 



MAH 



333 



MAH 



bend down to the hand of the person 
wlio would gather of its fruits, und tliat 
it will supply the blessed not only with 
food, but also with silken garments, and 
beasts to ride on ready saddled and Ijri- 
dled, and adorned with rich trappings, 
wliich will burst forth from its traits; 
and that tliis tree is so large, that a per- 
son mounted on the fleetest horse, would 
not be able to gallop from one end of its 
shade to tlie other in one hundred years. 

As plenty of water is one of the gi-eat- 
est additions to the pleasantness of any 
place, the Koran often speaks of the ri- 
vers of Par;:idise as a principal ornament 
thereof: some of these rivers, they sa)^ 
flow with water, some with milk, some 
with wine, and others with honey; all 
taking their rise from the root of the 
tree tuba. 

But aU these glories will be eclipsed 
by the resplendent and ravishing girls of 
Paradise, called, from their large black 
eyes, Hur al oyun, the enjoyment of 
whose company will lie a principal feli- 
city of the taithful. Tiiese, they say, are 
created not of clay, as mortal women 
are, but of pure musk ; being, as their 

firophet often aflirms in his Koran, free 
rom all natural impurities, defects, and 
inconveniences incident to the sex; of 
the strictest modesty, and secluded from 
public view in pavilions of hollow pearls, 
so large, tliat, as some traditions have 
it, one of them will be no less tlian four 

f)arasangs (or, as others say, sixty miles) 
ong, and as many broad. 

The name wliich the Mahometans 
usually give to this happy mansion is al 
Jayinat, or, "the Garden;" and some- 
times they call it, with an addition, Jan- 
nat al Ferdaxvs, "the Garden of Para- 
dise ;" Jannat Adan, " the Garden of 
Eden," (though they generally inter- 
pret the word Eden not according to 
Its acceptation in Hebrew, but accord- 
ing to its meaning in their own tongue, 
wherein it signifies "a settled or per- 
petual habitation;") Jannat al Mawa, 
'•the Garden of Abode; Jannat -al 
JMaim, "the Garden of Pleasure;" and 
the like : by which several appellations 
some understand so many different gar- 
dens, or at least places of different de- 
grees of felicity (for they reckon no less 
than one hundi-ed such in all,) the very 
meanest whereof will afford its inhabi- 
tants so many pleasures and delights, 
that one would conclude they must even 
sink under them, had not Mahomet de- 
clared that, in order to qualify the bless- 
ed for a full enjoyment of them, God 
■will give to every one the abilities of one 
hundred men. 
6. God's absolute decree and predes- 



tination both of ^ood and e\'il. The or 
thodox doctrine is, that whatever hath 
or shall come to pass in this world, 
whether it be good, or whether it be 
bad, proceedeth entirely from the di- 
vine will, and is in-evocably fixed and 
recorded from all eternity in the pre- 
served table ; God liaving secretly pre- 
determined not only the adverse and 
prosperous fortune of every person in 
this world, in the most minute particu- 
lars, but also his faith or infidelity, his 
oljedience or disobedience, and conse- 
quently his everlasting happiness or 
misery after death ; which fate or pre- 
destination it is not possible by any fore- 
sight or wisdom to avoid. 

II. Religious firactice. 1. The first 
point is prayer, under which are also 
compreliended those legal washings or 
purifications which are necessary pre- 
parations thereto. 

For the regidar performance of the 
duty of prayer among the Mahometans, 
it is requisite, while "they pray, to turn 
their faces towards the temple of Mec- 
ca ; the quarter where the same is situ- 
ated being, for that reason, pointed out 
within their mosques by a niche, which 
they«call a/ Mehrab ; and without, by 
the situation of the doors opening into 
the galleries of the steeples : there are 
also tables calculated for the ready find- 
ing out their Keblah, a part towards 
wiiicli they ought to pray, in places 
where they ha\'e no other direction. 

2. Alms are of two sorts, legal and 
voluntary. The legal alms are of indis- 
pensable obligation, being commanded 
by the law, which directs and deter- 
mines both the. portion which is to be 
given, and of what things it ought to 
consist ; but the voluntary aims are left 
to every one's liberty, to give moi-e or 
less as he shall see fit. The former 
kind of alms some think to be properly 
called zacat, and the latter sadacat, 
though this name be also frequently 
given to the legal alms. They are called 
zacat, either because they increase a 
man's store by drawing domi a blessing 
thereon, and produce in his soul the vir- 
tue of liberality ; or because they purify 
the remainhig part of one's substance 
from pollution, and the soul from the 
filth of avarice ; and sadacat, because 
they are a proof of a man's sincerity in 
the worship of God. Some writers have 
called the legal alms tithes ; but impro- 
]jerly, since in some cases they fall 
short, and in others exceed that pro- 
portion. 

3. Fasti7ig is a duty of so great mo- 
ment, that Mahomet used to say it was 
the gate ofrebs^ion ; and that the odour 



MAH 



334 



MAL 



nf the mouth of him who fasteth is more 
grateful to God them theit of musk ; and 
A\ Gliazali reckons fasting one fourth 
part of the faith. According to the Ma- 
lionietan divines, there are three de- 
grees of fasting: 1. The restraining the 
belly and other parts of the body from 
satisfying their lusts. — 2. The restram- 
ing the ears, eyes, tongue, hands, feet, 
and other members, from sin. — 3. The 
fasting of the heart from worldly cares, 
and restraining the thought from every 
thing besides God. 

4. The pilgrimage to Mecca is so ne- 
cessary a point of practice, that, accord- 
ing to a tradition of Mahomet, he who 
dies without performing it, may as well 
die a Jew or a Christian ; and the same 
is exijressly commanded in the Koran. 
See Pilgrimage. 

III. Mahometanism, causes of the 
success of. The rapid success which 
attended the propagation of this new 
religion was owing to causes that are 
plain and e\'ident, and must remove, or 
j-athei' prevent our sui-prise, when they 
are attenti\'ely considered. The terror 
of Mahomet's arms, and the repeated 
victories which were gained by hmi and 
}iis successors, were, no doubt, the*irre- 
sistible arguments that jiersuaded' such 
multitudes to embrace his religion, and 
sul)mit to his dominion. Besides, his law 
was artfully and marvellously adapted 
to the corrupt nature of man ; and, in a 
most particular manner, to the manners 
and opinions of the Eastern nations, and 
the vices to which they were naturally 
addicted : for the articles of faith which 
it proposed were few in nun^ber, and 
extremely simple ; and the duties it re- 
cjuired were neither many nor difficult, 
nor such as were incom])atiljle with the 
empire of appetites and passions. It is 
to be ol5served farther, that the grobs 
ignorance under which the Arabians, 
Svrians, Persians, and the greatest part 
of the Eastern nations, laboured at this 
time, rendered many an easy pre}' to the 
artifice and eloquence of this bold ad- 
venturer. To these causes of the pro- 
gress of Mahometanism we may add the 
bitter dissensions and cniel animosities 
tliat reigned among the Christian sects, 
particularly the Greeks, Ncstovians, 
I'jUtychians, and Monophysites ; dissen- 
j.ions that filled a great part of the East 
with carnage, assassinations, and such 
detestable enormities, as rendered the 
very name of Christianity odious to 
many. We miglit add here, that the 
Monoph}'sites and Nestorians, full of 
resentment against the Greeks, from 
%vhom they had suffered the bitterest 
and most injurious treatment, assisted 



the Arabians in the conquest of several 
provinces, into which, of consequence, 
the religion of Mahomet was afterwards 
introduced. Other causes of the sudden 
progress of that religion will naturally 
occur to such as consider attentively its 
spirit and genius, and the state of the 
world at this time. 

IV. Mahometanism, subversion of. 
Of things yet to come it is difficult to 
say any thing with precision. We have, 
liowever, some reason to believe, from 
the aspect of Scripture prophecy, that, 
triumphant as this sect has been, it shall 
at last come to nought. As it. arose as a 
scourge to Christendom about the time 
that Antichrist obtained a temporal do- 
minion, so it is not improbable but they 
will have their downfall nearly at the 
same period. The ninth chapter of Re- 
velations seems to refer wholly to this 
imposture: "The four angels were 
loosed," says the prediction, 15th verse, 
" which were prepared for an hour, and 
a day, and a month, and a year, for to 
slay tlie third part of men. This pe- 
riod, in the language of prophecy, 
makes 391 years, which being added to 
the year when the four angels were 
loosed, Avill bring us down to 1844, or 
thereabouts, for the final destruction of 
the Mahometan empire. It must be 
confessed, however, that though the 
event is certain, the exact time cannot 
be easily ascertained. Frideaujc's Life

MALEVOLENCE is that disposition 
of mind which inclines us to wish ill to 
any person. It discovers itself in frowns 
and a lowering countenance ; in uncha- 
ritableness, in evil sentiments; hard 
speeches to or of its object ; in cursing 
and reviling ; and doing mischief either 
with open violence or secret spite, as 
far as there is power. 

MALICE is a settled or deliberate 
determination to revenge or do hurt to 
anotlier. It more frequently denotes the 
disposition of inferior minds to execute 
every purpose of mischief within the 
more limited circle of their abilities. It 
is a most hateful temper in the sight of 
Ciod, strictly forbidden in his holy \vord. 
Col. iii. 8—12. disgraceful to rational 
creatures, and every way inimical to the 
spirit of Christianity, Matt. v. 44. See

MALIGNITY, a disposition obsti- 



MAN 



335 



MAN 



nately bad or malicious. Malignancy 
and malignity are words nearly synony- 
mous. In some connections, maHgnity 
seems rather more pertinently applied 
to a radical depravity of nature ; and 
malignancy to indications of this depra- 
vity in temper and conduct in particular 
instances. 

MAN, a b'eing, consisting of a rational 
soul and organical body. By some he is 
defined thus: "He is the head of the 
animal creation ; a being who feels, re- 
flects, thinks, contrives, and acts ; who 
has the poAver of changing his place 
upon the earth at pleasure ; who pos- 
sesses the faculty of communicating his 
thoughts by means of speech, and who 
has dominion over all other creatures on 
the face of the earth." W'e shall here 
present the reader with a brief account 
of his formation, species, and different 
state. 1. His formation. Man was made 
last of all the creatures, being the chief 
and master-piece of the whole creation 
on earth. He is a compendium of the 
creation, and therefore is sometimes 
called a microcosm, a little world, the 
world in miniature ; something of the 
vegetable, animal, and rational world 
meet in him ; spirit and matter ; yea, 
heaven and earth centre in him ; he is 
the bond that connects them both to- 
gether. The constituent and essential 
parts of man created by God are two; 
body and soul. The one was made out of 
the dust ; the other was breathed into 
him. The body is formed with the 
gi'eatest precision and exactness : every 
muscle, vein, artery, yea, the least fibre, 
in its proper place ; all in just propor- 
tion and symmetry, in subser\iency to 
the use of each other, and for the good 
of the whole, Ps. cxxxix. 14. It is also 
made erect, to distinguish it from the 
four-footed animals, who look down- 
ward to the earth. Man was made to 
look upward to the heavens, to contem- 
plate them, and the glory of God dis- 
played in them ; to look up to God, to 
worship and adore him. In the Greek 
language, pan has his name, avSfujros, 
from turning and looking upwards. The 
soul is the other part of man, which is a 
substance or subsistence : it is not an ac- 
cident, or quality, inhei^nt in a subject : 
but capaljle of subsisting without the 
body. It is a spiritual substance, imma- 
terial, immortal. See Soul. 

2. Man, different species of. Accord- 
ing to LinuKus and BufFon, there are 
six different species among mankind. 
The first are those under the Polar re- 
gions, and compiehend the Laplanders, 
the Esquimaux Indians, the Samoied 
Tartars, the inhabitants of Nova Zem- 



bla, Borandians, the Grecnlanders, and 
the people of Kamtschatka. The visage 
of men in these countries is large and 
broad ; the nose flat and short ; the 
e}'es of a yellowish brown, inclining to 
blackness ; the cheek-bones extremely 
high ; the mouth large ; the lips thick, 
and turning outwards ; the voice thin, 
and squeaking ; and the skin a dark 
grey colour. 'Fhey are short in stature, 
the generality being about four feet 
high, and the tallest not more than five. 
They are ignorant, stupid and super- 
stitious. — 2. The second are the Tartar 
race, comprehending the Chinese and 
the Japanese. Their countenances are 
broad and wi'inkled, even in youth; 
their noses short and flat ; then- ejes 
little, cheek-l)ones high, teeth large, 
complexions olive, and the hair black. 
— 3. The third are the southern Asiatics, 
or inhabitants of India. These are of a 
slender shape, long straight black hair, 
and generally Roman noses. They are 
slothful, submissive, cowardly, and ef- 
feminate. — 4. The negroes of Africa 
constitute the fourth striking variety in 
the human species. They are of a black 
colour, having downy soft hair, short 
and black ; their beards often turn grey, 
and sometimes white ; their noses are 
flat and short ; their lips thick, and their 
teeth of an ivory whiteness. These have 
been till of late the unhappy wretches 
who have been torn from their families, 
friends, and native lands, and consigned 
for life to misery, toil, and bondage; 
and that by the wise, polished, and the 
Christian inhabitants of Europe, and 
above all by the monsters of England ! ! 
— 5. The natives of America are the 
fifth race of men ; they are of a copper 
colour, with black thick straight hair, 
flat noses, high cheek-bones, and small 
eyes. — 6. The Europeans may be consi- 
dered as the sixth and last ya.riety of 
the human kind, whose features we 
need not describe. The English are 
considered as the fairest. 

3. Mem, different states of. The state 
of man has been divided into fourfold : 
his primitive state ; fallen state ; gra- 
cious state; and future state. 1. His 
state of innocence. God, it is said, made 
man upright, Eccl. vii. 29. without any 
imperfection, corruption, or princii^le of 
coniiption in his bodv or soul; with 
light in his understanding, holiness in 
his will, and purity in his affection. Thi.s 
constituted His original rigliteousness, 
which was universal, both witli respect 
to the subject of it, the whole man, and 
the object of it, the whole law. Being 
thus in a state of holiness, he was neces- 
sarily in a state of happiness. He v-ras a

very glorious creature, the favourite of 
heaven, the lord of the world, possess- 
ing perfect tranquillity in his own breast, 
and immortal. Yet he was not without 
law ; for to the law of nature, which 
was impressed on his heai't, God super- 
added a positive law,' not to eat of tlie 
forbidden fruit, Gen. ii. 17. under the 
penalty of death natural, spiritual, and 
eternal. Had he obeyed this law, he 
might have had reason to expect that 
he would not only ha^ e had the contin- 
uance of his natural and spiritual life, 
but have been transported to the upper 
paradise. — 2. His full. Man's righteous- 
ness, howe^■er, though universal, was 
not imnuitable, as the event has proved. 
How long he lived in a state of inno- 
cence cannot easily be ascertained, yet 
most suppose it was but a short time. 
The positive law which God gave him 
he broke, by eating the forbidden fruit. 
The consequence of this evil act was, 
that man lost the. chief good : his na- 
ture was cornipted ; his powers depra- 
ved, his body subject to corruption, his 
soul exposed to miseiy, his posterity all 
involved in ruin, subject to eternal con- 
demnation, and for ever incapable to re- 
store themselves to the favour of God, 
to obey his commands perfectly, and to 
satisfy his justice. Gal. lii. Rom. v. Gen. 
iii. Eph. ii. Rom. iii. passim. See Fall. 
— 3. His recovery. Although man has 
fallen by his iniquity, yet he is not left 
finally to perish. The divine Being, 
foreseeing the fall, in infinite love and 
mercy made provision for his relief. 
Jesus Christ, according to the divine 
purpose, came in the fulness of time to 
be his Saviour, and by virtue of his suf- 
ferings, all who believe are justified from 
tlie curse of the law. By the influences 
of the Holy Spirit he is regenerated, 
united to Christ by faith, and sanctified. 
True believers, therefore, live a life of 
dependence on the promises ; of regu- 
Igirity and obedience to God's word ; of 
holy joy and peace ; and have a hope 
full of immortality. — 4. His future state. 
As it respects the impenitent, it. is a 
state of separation from God, arid eter- 
nal punishment, Matt. xxv. 46. But the 
righteous shall rise to glory, honour, 
• and everlasting joy. To the former, 
death will be the introduction to misery ; 
to the latter, it will be the admission to 
felicity. All will be tried in the judg- 
ment-day, and sentence pronovmced ac- 
cordingly. The wicked will be driven 
away in his wickedness, and the righ- 
teous be saved with an everlasting sal- 
vation. But as these subjects are treated 
on elsewhere, we refer the reader to

MANICHEES or Manicheans, 
(iManich^ei,) a sect of ancient heretics, 
who asserted two principles ; so called 
from their author Alanes, or Alani- 
chreus, a Persian by nation, and educa- 
ted among the Magi, being himself one 
of that number before he embraced 
Christianity. 

This heresy had its first rise about 
the year 277, and spread itself princi- 
pally in Arabia, Egypt and Africa. St. 
Epiphanius, who treats of it at large, 
observes that the true name of this he- 
resiarch was Cubricus ; and that he 
changed it for Manes, which in the 
Persian or Babylonish language signi- 
fies vessel. A rich widow, Avhose ser- 
vant he had been, dying without issue, 
left him stores of wealth ; after which 
he assumed the title of the apostle or 
envoy of Jesus Christ. 

Manes was not contented with the 
quality of apostle of Jesus Christ, but 
he also assumed that of the paraclete, 
whom Christ had promised to send; 
which Augustine explains, by saying, 
that Manes endeavoured to persuade 
meiij that the Holy Ghost did personally 
dwell in him with full authority. He left 
several disciples; and among others, 
Addas, Thomas, and Hermas. These 
he sent in his life-time into several pro- 
vinces to preach his doctrine. Manes 
having undertaken to cure the king of 
Persia's son, and not succeeding, was 
put in prison upon the young priiice's 
death, whence he made his escape ; 
but he was apprehended soon after, and 
flayed alive. 

However, the oriental winters cited 
by D'Herbelot and Hyde, tell us that 
Manes, after having been protected in 
a singular m.anner by Hormizdas, who 
succeeded Sapor in the Pe^ian throne, 
but who was not able to defend him, at 
length, against the united hatred of the 
Christians, the Magi, the Jews, and the 
Pagans, was sl*ut up in a strong cas- 
tle, to serve him as a refuge against 
those who persecuted him on account, 
of his doctrine. They add, that after 
the death of Hormizdas, Varanes I. his 
successor, first protected Manes, but 
afterwards gave him up to the fury _ot 
the Magi, whose resentment against him 
was due to his having adopted the Sad- 
ducean principles, as some say; Avhile 
others attribute it to his having mingled

the tenets of the Magi with the doc- 
trines of Christianity. However, it is 
certain that the Manicheans celebrated 
the day of their master's death. It has 
been a subject of much controversy 
whether Manes was an impostor. The 
learned Dr. Lardner has examined the 
arguments on both sides; and tliough 
he does not choose to deny that he was 
an impostor, he does not discern evident 
proofs of it.' He acknowledges that he 
was an arrogant philosopher, and a 
great schemist; but whether he was an 
impostor he cannot certainly say. He 
was much too fond of philosophical no- 
tions, which he endeavoured to bring 
into religion, for which he is to be 
blamed: nevertheless he observes that, 
every bold dogmatizerisnct an impostor. 

The doctrine of Manes was a motley 
mixture of the tenets of Christianity 
with the ancient philosophy of the Per- 
sians, in which he had heen instnicted 
during his youth. He combined these 
two systems, and applied and accom- 
modated to Jesus Christ the characters 
and actions which the Persians attribut- 
ed to the god Mithras. 

He established two principles, viz. a 
good and an evil one: the first a most 
pure and subtle matter, which he called 
light, did nothing but good ; and the se- 
cond a gross and corrupt substance, 
which he called darkness, nothing but 
evil. This philosophy is very ancient ; 
and Plutarch treats ot it at large in his 
Iris and Osiris. Our souls, according to 
Manes, were made by the good princi- 
ple, and our bodies by the evil one ; 
' these two principles being, according to 
him, co-eternal and independent of each 
other. Each of these is subject to the 
dominion of a superintendent Being, 
whose existence is from all eternity. 
The Being who presides over the light 
is called God ; he that rules the land of 
darkness bears the title of hijle or de- 
mon. The ruler of the light is supreme- 
ly happy, and in consequence thereof 
benevolent and good ; the prince of 
darkness is unhappy in himself and de- 
sirous of rendering others partakers of 
his misery ; and is evil and malignant. 
These two bemgs have produced an im- 
mense multitude of creatures resern- 
bhng themselves, and distributed them 
tlirough their respective provinces. Af- 
ter a contest between the ruler of light 
and the prince of darkness, in which 
the latter was defeated, this prince of 
darkness produced the first parents of 
the human race. The beings engender- 
ed from this original stock consist of a 
body fonned out of the con-upt matter 
of the kingdom of darkness, and of t-wo 



souls ; one of which is sensitive and lust- 
ful, and owes its existence to the evil 
principle; the other rational and im- 
mortal, a particle of that divine light 
which had been carried away in the 
contest l)y the army of darkness, and 
immersed into the mass of malignant 
matter. The earth was created by 
God out of this corrupt mass of matter, 
in order to be a dwelling for the human 
race, that their captive souls might by 
degrees be delivered from their corpo- 
real prisons, and the celestial elements 
extricated ^rom the gross substance in 
which they were involved. With this 
view. God produced two beings from 
his own substance, viz. Christ and the 
Holy Ghost ; for the Manicheans held 
a consubstantial Trinity. Christ, or 
the glorious intelligence, called by the 
Persians Mithras, subsisting in and by 
himself, and residing in the sun, ap- 
peared in due time among the Jews, 
clothed with the shadowy form of a 
human body, to disengage the rational 
soul from the corrupt body, and to con- 
quer the violence of malignant matter. 
The Jews, incited by the prince of dark- 
ness, put him to an ignommious death; 
which he suffered not in reality, but 
only in appearance, and according to 
the opinion of men. When the purposes 
of Christ were accomplished, he return- 
ed to his throne in the sun, appomting 
apostles to propagate his religion, and 
leavmg his followers the promise of the 
paraclete or comforter, who is Man^s 
the Persian. Those souls who believe 
Jesus Christ to be the Son of God, re- 
nounce the worship of the god of the 
Jews, who is the prince of darkness, and 
obey the laws delivered by Christ, and 
illustrated by Manes the comforter, are 
gradually puriiied from the contagion 
of matter ; and their purification being 
completed, after having passed through 
two states of trial, by water and fire, 
first in the moon and then in the sun, 
their bodies return to the original mass 
(for the Manicheans derided the resur- 
rection of bodies,) and their souls ascend 
to the regions of light. But the souls of 
those who have neglected the salutary 
work of purification, pass after death 
into the bodies of other animals and na- 
tures, where they remain till they liave 
accomplished their probation. Some, 
however, more perverse and obstinate, 
are consigned to a severer course of trial, 
being delivered over for a time to the 
power of malignant aerial spirits, who 
torment them m various ways. After 
this, a fire shall break forth and con- 
sume the frame of the world ; and the 
prince and powers of darkness shaJl re-

riini to their primitive seats of anguish 
and misery, in whicli they shall dwell 
for ever. These mansions shall be sur- 
rounded by an invincible guard, to pre- 
vent their ever renewing a war in the 
regions of light. 

Ixlanes bon-owed many things from 
the ancient Gnostics ; on which account 
many authors consider the Manicheans 
as a branch of the Gnostics. 

In tiiith, the Manichean doctrine was 
a system of philosophy rather than of 
religion. They made use of amulets, in 
imitation of the Basilidians ; ^nd are said 
. to have made profession of astronomy 
and astrology. They denied that Jesus 
Christ, who v/as only God, assumed a 
tme human body, and maintained it was 
only imaginary ; and therefore thev de- 
nied his mcarnation, death, 8cc. They 
pretended that the law of Moses did not 
come ^'om God, or the good principle, 
but from the evil one ; and that for this 
reason it was abrogated. They rejected 
almost all the sacred books in which 
Chiistians look for the sublime truths of 
their holy religion. They affirmed that 
the Old Testament was not the work of 
Xrod, but of the prince of darkness, who 
was substituted bv the Jews in the place 
of the true God. They abstained entire- 
ly from eating the flesh of any animal, 
following herein the doctrine of the an- 
cient Pythagoi-eans : they also condemn- 
ed marriage. The rest of their errors 
may be seen in St. Epiphanius and St 
•igustine ; which last, having been of 
ftieir sect, may be presumed to have 
been thoroughly acquainted with them. 

Though the Manichees pi-ofessed to 
receive the Ijooks of the New Testa- 
ment, yet in eflect they only took so 
much of them as suited with their own 
opinions. They first formed to them- 
selves a certain idea or scheme of Chris- 
tianity, and to this adjusted the writings 
of the apostles, pretending that what- 
ever was inconsistent with this had 
been foisted into the New Testament 
by the later writers, who were half 
Jews. On the other hand, they made 
fables and apocryphal books pass for 
apostolical writings ; and even are sus- 
pected to have foi'ged several others, 
the better to maintain their errors. St. 
Epiphanius gives a catalogue of several 
pieces published by Manes, and adds 
extracts out of some of them. These 
are the Mysteries, Chapters, Gospel, 
and Treasuiy. 

The rule of life and manners which 
Manes prescribed to his followers was 
most exti-avagantly rigorous and severe. 
However, he divided his disciples into 
two classes ; one of which comprehend- 



ed the perfect Christian, under the 
name of the elect ; and the other the 
imperfect and feeble, under the title of 
auditors or hearers. The elect were 
obliged to rigorous and entire abstinence 
from flesh, eggs, milk, fish, wine, all in- 
toxicating drink, wedlock, and all amo- 
rous gratifications ; and to live in a state 
of the severest penun", nourishing their 
emaciated bodies with bread, herbs, 
pulse and melons, and depriving them- 
selves' of all the comforts that ajnse from 
the moder?cte indulgence of natural pas- 
sions, and also from a variety of inno- 
cent and agreeable pursuits. The audi- 
tors were allowed to possess houses, 
lands, and wealth; to feed on flesh, to 
enter into the bonds of conjugal tender- 
ness ; but this liberty was granted them 
with many limitations, and under the 
strictest conditions of moderation and 
temperance. The general assembly of 
Manicheans w-as headed by a president, 
who represented Jesus Christ. There 
were joined to him twelve inilers or 
masters, who were designed to repre- 
sent the twelve apostles, and these 
were followed by seventy -two bishops ; 
the images of the seventy-two disciples 
of our Lord. These bishops had prcs-^ 
byters or deacons under them, and all' 
the members of these religious orders 
wei'e chosen out of the class of the elect. 
Their worship was simple and plain, 
and consisted of prayers, reading thg 
Scriptures, and hearing public discours- 
es, at whicli both the auditors and elect 
were allowed to be present. They also 
observed the Christian appointment of, 
baptism, and the eucharist. They kept 
the Jvord's day, observing it as a fast: 
and they likewise kept liaster and the 
Pentecost. 

Towards the fourth century the Mani- 
cheans concealed themselves under va- 
rious names, which they successively 
adopted, and changed in propoilion as 
they were discovered by them. Thus 
they assumed the names of Encratites, 
Apotactics, Saccophori, Hydroparas- 
tates. Solitaries, and several others, un- 
der which they lay concealed for a cer- 
tain time, but could not, however, long 
escape the vigilance of their enemies. 
About the close of the sixth ceiituiy, 
this sect gained a very considerable in- 
fluence, particularly among the Per- 
sians. 

Towards the middle of the twelfth 
century, the sect of Manichees took a 
new face, on account of one Constan- 
tine, an Armenian, and an adherer to 
it ; who took upon him to suppress the 
reading of all other books besides the 
evangelists and the epistles of St. Paul.

which he explained in such a manner 
as to make them contain a new sjstem 
of Manicheism. He entirely discarded 
all the wntings of his predecessors ; re- 
jecting the chimeras of the Valentini- 
ans and their thirty xons : the fable of 
Mtmes, with regard to the origin of rain, 
and other dreams ; but still retained the 
impurities of Basilides. In this manner 
he reformed Manicheism, insomuch that 
his followers made no scruple of ana- 
thematizing Schythian, Buddas, called 
also Addas and Terehinth, the contem- 
poraries and disciples, as some say, and, 
according to others, the predecessors 
and masters of Manes, and even Manes 
himself; Constantine being no"\v their 
great apostle. After he had seduced an 
infinite number of people, he was at last 
stoned by order of the emperor. 

This sect prevailed in Bosnia and the 
adjacent provinces about the close of 
the fifteenth century ; propagated their 
doctrine with confidence, and held their 
religious assemblies with impunity. 

MANNERS: the plural noiin has 
various significations ; as the general 
way of life, the morals or the habits of 
any person ; also ceremonial behaviour 
or studied civility. Good manners, ac- 
cording to Swift, is the art of making 
those people easy with whom we con- 
verse. Pride, ill-nature, and want of 
sense, are the three great sources of ill- 
mannei-s. Without some one of these 
defects no man will behave himself ill 
for want of experience ; or of what, in 
the language of some, is called knowuig 
the world. For the effect that Christi- 
anity has on the manners of men, see 
article Christianity. 

MARCELLIANS, a sect of ancient 
heretics towards the close of the second 
century; so called from Marcellus of 
Ancyra, their leader, who was accused 
of reviving the errors of Sabellius. 
Some, however, are of opinion that 
Marcellus was orthodox, and that they 
were his enemies the Arians, who fa- 
thered their errors upon him. St. Epi- 
phanius observes, that there was a great 
deal of dispute with regard to the real 
tenets of Marcellus ; biit as to his fol- 
lowers, it is evident that they did not 
own the three hypostases ; for Marcel- 
lus considered the Son and Holv Ghost 
as two emanations from the divine na- 
ture, which, after performing their re- 
spective offices, were to return again 
into the substance of tlie Father ; and 
this opinion is altogether incompatible 
with tlie belief of three distinct persons 
in the Godhead. 

MARCIONITES, or Marcionists, 
MarcionistcEy a very ancient and popular 



sect of heretics, who, in the time ot 
Epiphanius, vvere spread over Italy, 
Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Arabia, Persia, 
and other countries : they were thus de- 
nominated from their author Marcion. 
Marcion was of Pontus, the son of a bi- 
shop, and at first made profession of the 
monastical life ; but he was excommu- 
nicated by his own father, who would 
never admit liim again into communion 
with the church, not eijfcii on his repent- 
ance. On this he abagdoncd his own 
country, and retired to^B|me, where he 
began to broach his doctrines. 

He laid down two principles, the one 
good, the otlier evil ; between these he 
imagined an intermediate kind of Deity, 
of a mixed nature, who was the Creator 
of this inferioi" world, and the god and 
legislator of the Jewish nation: the 
other nations who worshipped a variety 
of gods, were supposed to be under the 
empire of the evil principle. These two 
conflicting powers exercised oppressions 
upon rational and immoital souls; and 
therefore the supreme God, to deliver 
them from bondage, sent to the Jews a 
Being more like unto himself, even his 
Son Jesus Christ, clothed with a certain 
shadowy resemblance of a body: this 
celestial messenger was attacked by 
tlie prince of darkness, and by the god 
of the Jews, liut without effect. Those 
who followed the directi(3ns of this ce- 
lestial conductor, mortify the body by 
fastings and austeiitie.s, and renounce 
the precepts of the god of tlie Jews and 
of the prince of darkness, shall after 
death ascend to the mansions of felicity 
and perfection. The rule of manners 
which Marcion prescribed to his follow- 
ers was excessively austere, containing 
an express j^rohibition of wedlock, wine, 
flesh, and all the external comforts ot 
life. 

Marcion denied the real birth, incar- 
nation, and passion of Jesus Christ, and 
held them to be apparent only. He de- 
nied the resurrection of the body, and 
allowed none to Ije baptized liut those 
who presei'ved their continence ; but 
these he granted might be baptized 
three times. In many things he follow- 
ed the sentiments of the heretic Cerdon, 
and rejected the law and the prophets. 
He i:&gt;retended the Gospel had been cor- 
rupted by false prophets, and allowed 
none of the evangelists but St Luke, 
whom also he altered in many places, 
as well as the epistles ^f St'. Paul, a 
great many thir.gs in which he threw 
fMit. In his own copy of St. Luke he 
thri'w out the first two chapters entire. 

MARCITES, MARCIT.E, a sect of 
heretics in the second century, who also

called themselves the perfecti, and made 
profession of doing every thing with a 
great deal of liberty and without fear. 
This doctrhie they borrowed from Si- 
mon Magus, who however was not their 
chief; for they were called Marcites 
from one Marcus, who conferred the 
priesthood, and the administi-ation of 
the sacraments, on women. 

MARCOSIi'^jK, or Colobarsians, 
an ancient sect^OTrhe church, making a 
briinch of theJplentinians. 

St. Irenxu^^jeaks at large of the 
leader of this sect, Marcus, who it 
seems was reputed a great magician. 
The Marcosians had a great number of 
apociyphal books which they held for 
canonical, and of the same authority 
■with ours. Out of these they picked 
several idle fables touching the uifancy 
of Jesus Christ, which they put off for 
true histories. Many of these fables 
are still in use and credit among the 
Greek monks. 

MARONITES, in ecclesiastical his- 
tory, a sect of eastern Christians who 
follow the Syrian rite, and are subject to 
the pope ; their principal habitation be- 
ing on Mount Libanus. 

Mosheim informs us that the doctrine 
of the Monothelites, condemned and ex- 
ploded by the council of Constantinople, 
found a place of refuge among the iVfar- 
daites, a people who inhabited the 
Mounts Libanus and Atilibanus, and 
who about the conclusion of the seventh 
century, were called Maronites, after 
Maro, their first bishop ; a name which 
thev still retain. None (he says) of the 
ancient writers give any account of the 
first person who instructed these moun- 
taineers in the doctrine of the Monothe- 
lites : it is probable, however, from se- 
veral circumstances, that it was John 
Maro, whose name they adopted ; and 
that this ecclesiastic received the name 
of Maro from his having lived in the 
character of a monk in the famous con- 
vent of St. Maro, upon the borders of 
the Orontes, before his settlement 
among the Mardaites of Mount Liba- 
nus. One thing is certain, from the 
testimony of Tyrius and other unexcep- 
tionable witnesses, as also from the most 
authentic records, viz. that the Maron- 
ites retained the opinions of the Mono- 
thelites until the twelfth century, when 
abandoning and renouncing the doctrine 
of one will in Christ, they were re-ad- 
mitted in the year 1182 to the commu- 
nion of the Roman church. The most 
leai-ned of the modem Maronites have 
left no metliod unemployed to defend 
their' church against this accusation ; 
they have laboured to prove, by a va- 



riety of testimonies, that their ancestors 
always persevered in the CathoUc faith, 
in their attachment to the Roman pon- 
tiif, A^ithout ever adopting the doctrine 
of the Monophysites, or MonotheUtes. 
But all their efforts are insufficient to 
prove the truth of these assertions to 
such as have any acquaintance with the 
historj' of the church, and the records 
of ancient times; for to all such, the 
testimonies they allege will appear ab- 
solutely fictitious, and destitute of au- 
thority. 

Faustus Noiron, a Maronite settled at 
Rome, Hlis published an apology for 
Maro ^d the rest of his nation. His 
tenet is, that they really took their name 
from the Maro, who lived about the 
year 400, and of whom mention is made 
in Chrysostom, Theodoret, and the Me- 
nologium of the Greeks. He adds, that 
the disciples of this Maro spread them- 
selves throughout aU Syria; that they 
built several monasteries, and among 
others one that bore the name of their 
leader; that all the Syrians who were 
not tainted with heresy took refuge 
among them ; and that for this reason 
the heretics of those times called them 
Maronites. 

Mosheim obsen'es, that the suljjection 
of the Maronites to the spiritual juris- 
diction of the Roman pontiff was agreed 
to with this express condition ; that nei- 
ther the popes nor their emissaiies 
should pretend to change or abolish any 
thing that related to the ancient rites, 
moral precepts, or religious opinions of 
this people : so that in reality there is 
nothing to be found among the Maron- 
ites that savours of popery, if we except 
their attachment to the Roman pontiff, 
who is obliged to pay verv dear for their 
friendship. For as the Maronites live 
in the utmost distress of poverty, under 
the tyrannical yoke of the Mahometans, 
the bishop of Rome is under the necessity 
of furnishing them with subsidies as may 
appease their oppressors, procure a 
subsistence for the bishop and clergy, 
provide all things requisite for the sup- 
port of their churches, and the uninter- 
rupted exercise of public worship, and 
contribute in general to lessen their mi- 
series. It is certain that there are Ma- 
ronites in Syria who still behold the 
church of Rome with the greatest aver- 
sion and abhorrence ; nay, what is still 
more i-emarkable, great numbers of 
that nation residing in Italy, even under 
the eye of the pontiff, opposed his au- 
thority during the last century, and 
threw the court of Rome into great per- 
plexit)'. One body of these non-conform- 
ing Mai'onites retired into the valleys of

Piedmont, where tltey joined the Wal- 
denses; another, above six hundred in 
number, with a bishop and sevtral ec- 
clesiastics at then- liead, fled into Cor- 
sica, and implored the protection of the 
Republic of Genoa agamst the violence 
of the inquisitors. 

The Maronites have a patriarch who 
resides in the monastery of Cannubin, 
on Mount Libanus, and assumes the 
title of patriarch of Antioch, and the 
name of Peter, as if he seemed desirous 
of being considered as the successor of 
that apostle. He is elected by the cler- 
gy and the people, according to the an- 
cient custom ; but, since their re-union 
with the church of Rome, he is obliged 
to have a bull of confirmation froni the 
pope. He keeps a peipetual celibacy, 
as well as the rest of the bishops, his 
suffragans : as to the rest of the eccle- 
siastics, they are allowed to marry be- 
fore ordination ; and yet the monastic 
life is in great esteem among them. 
Their monks are of the order of St. 
Anthony, and live in tlie most obscure 
places m the mountains, far from the 
commerce of the world. 

As to their faith, they agree in the 
main with the rest of the Eastern 
church. Their priests do not say mass 
singly, but all say it together, stanciing 
round the altar. They communicate ui 
unleavened bread: aiid the laity have 
hitherto partaken in both kinds, though 
the practice of communicating m one 
has of late been getting footmg, having 
been introduced by little and little. In 
Lent they eat nothing, unless it be two 
or three hours before, sun-rising : their 
other fastings are very numerous.

thus: "A society formed between two 
persons of different sexes, chiefly for the 
m-ocreation and education of children." 
This union is very near and strict, and 
indeed indissoluble but by death, ex- 
cepting in one case; unfaithfulness in 
the one or the other by adultery or for- 
nication, Rom. vii. 2. Matt. v. 32. It is 
to be entered into with deliberation at a 
pi'oppr age, and with mutual consent, 
as well as with the consent of parents 
and guardians, under whose care single 
persons may be. It is a very honoui'able 
state, Heb. xiii. 4. being an institution 
of God, and that in Paradise, Gen. ii. 
Christ honoured marriage by his pre- 
sence, and at such a solemnity wrought 
his first miracle, John ii. Moreover, it 
is honourable, as families are formed 



and built up, the world peopled with 
inhabitants; it prevents incontinence 
and fornication, and, whei-e the various 
duties of it are attended to, renders life 
a blessmg. 

The laws of revelation, as well as 
most civdized countries, have made se- 
veral exceptions of persons m.anTing 
who are nearly related bj' blood. The 
marriage of parents and children ap- 
pears, at first view, contrary to nature, 
not merely on account of the disparity 
of age, but of the confusion which it in- 
troduces into natural relations, and it^ 
obliging to inconsistent duties; such as 
reverence to a son, and the daughter to 
be equal with the father, l^or can the 
son or daughter acquit themselves of 
such inconsistent duties as would ai'ise 
trom this unnatural union. The mar- 
riage of brothers and sisters, and of 
some other near relations, is likewise 
disapproved by reason on various ac- 
counts. It frustrates one design of mar- 
riage, which is to enlarge benevolence 
and friendship, by cementing various fa- 
milies in a close alliance. And, farther, 
were it allowed, young persons, instead 
of entering into marriage upon mature 
consideration, with a settled esteem and 
friendship, and a proper concern and 
provision for the support and education 
of children, woidd be in danger (through 
the intimacy and affection produced by 
their near relation, and being bred to'- 
gether) of sliding m their inconsiderate 
}ears into those criminal familiarities 
which are most destructive of the great 
ends of marriage. Most nations have 
agreed to brand such marriages as 
highly ci-iminal, who cannot be sup- 
posed to have derived their judgment 
trom Moses and the Israelites. It is pro- 
bable God expressly prohibited these 
marriages in the begiiming of mankind, 
and from the first heads ot families the 
prohibition might be transmitted as a 
most sacred law to their descendants. 
See Incest. 

Some have supposed from those pas- 
sages, 1 Tim. iii. 2. Tit. i. 6. that bishops 
or pastors ought never to marry a se- 
cond wife. But such a prohibition would 
be contrary to natural right, and the de- 
sign of the law itself ; neither of which 
was everintended to be set aside by the 
Gospel dispensation. It is more prol^a- 
bly designed to guard against polygam}-, 
and against divorce on fri\olous occa- 
sions; both of which were frequent 
among the Jews, but condemned by our 
Lord, Matt. xix. 3—9. 

The duties of this state are on the

any shown to any other person j a leve

MARTYR, is one who lays down his 
life or suffers death for the sake of his 
religion. The word is Greek, /iajruj, 
and propei'ly signifies a "witness." It 
is applied by way of eminence to those 
who suffer in witness of the truth of the 
Gospel. 

The Christian church has abounded | 
with martyrs, and history is filled with j 
surprisuig accounts of their singular 
constanc)^ and fortitude under the ciniel- 
est torments human nature was capa- 
ble of suffering. The primitive Chris- 
tians wei-e accused by their enemies of 
paying a sort of divine worship to mar- 
tyrs. Of this we have an instance in 
the answer of the church of Smyrna 
to the suggestion of the Jews, who, at 
the martyrdom of Polycarp, desired the 
heathen judge not to suffer the Chris- 
tians to carry off his body, lest they 
should leave their crucified master, and 
worship him in his stead. To Avhich 
they answei'ed, "We can neither for- 
sake Christ, nor worship any other ; for 
we worship him as the Son of God ; but 
love the martyrs as' the disciples and 
followers of the Lord, for tlie great af- 
fection they have shown to their King 
and Master." A like answer was gi\en 
at the martyrdom of Fructuosus in 
Spain ; for when the judge asked Eulo- 
gius, his deacon, whether he would not 
worship Fructuosus, as thinking, that, 
though he refused to worship the hea- 
then idols, he might yet be inclined to 
worship a Christian martyr, Euiogius 
I'eplied, " I do^not worship Fructuosus, 
but him whom Fructuosus worships." 



The primitive Chrtstians believed that 
the martyrs enjoyed \ ery singular pri- 
vileges; that upon tliear death they 
were immediately admitted to the be- 
atific vision, while othei- souls waited for 
the completion of their happiness till . 
the day of judgment; and that God 
would gi-ant to their prayers the has- 
tening of his kingdom, and shortening 
the times of persecution. Perhaps this 
consideration might excite many to court 
martyrdom, as we believe many did. It 
nuist be recollected, however, that mar- 
tyrdom in itself is no proof of the good- 
ness of our cause, only that we ourselves 
are persuaded that it is so. "It is not 
tlie blood, but the cause that makes the 
martyr." {Mead.) Yet we may consi- 
der the number and fortitude of those 
who ha\e sufi'ered for Christianity as a 
collateral proof at least of its excel- 
lency ; for the thing for which they suf- 
fered was not a point of speculation, but 
a plain matter of fact, in which (had it 
been false) they could not have been 
mistaken. I'he martyrdom, therefore, 
of so many wise and good men, taken 
with a A'iew of the whole system of 
Christianity, will- certainly afford some- 
thing considerable in its favour. 

The churches built over the graves of 
the martyrs, and called by their names, 
in order to preserve tlie memory of 
their sufferings, were distingidshed by 
the title marlyrium confessio, or me- 
inoria. 

The festivals of the martyrs are of 
very ancient date in the ' Christian 
church, and may be carried back at 
least from the time of Polycarp, who 
suil'ered martyrdom about the year of 
Christ 168. On these days the "Chris- 
tians met at the graves ot the martyrs, 
and offered prayers and thanksgivings 
to God for the example they had afford- 
ed them : they celebrated the euchar- 
ist, and gave alms to the poor ; which, 
together with a panegyrical oration or 
sermon, and reading the acts of the 
martyrs, were tlie spiritual exercises 
of these anniversaries. 

Of the sayings, sufferings, and deaths 
of the martyrs, though preserved with 
great care tor the above purjiose, and 
to serve as models to future ages, we 
have but very little left, the greatest 
pai't of them having been destroyed 
during that dreadful persecution which 
Dioclesian carried on for ten years with 
fresh fury against the Chiistians ; for a 
most diligent search was then made af- 
ter all their books and papers ; and all 
of them that were found were committed 
to the flames. Eusebius, indeed, com- 
posed a martyrology, but it never reach-

MAS 



ed down to us; and those since com- 
piled are extremely suspected. From 
the eighth century downwards, several 
tireek. and Latin authors endeavoured 
to make up the loss, by compiling, with 
vast labour, accounts of the lives and 
actions of tlie ancient martyrs, but which 
consist o^ little else than a series of fa- 
bles: nor are those records that pass 
under the name of martyrology worthy 
of superior credit, since they bear the 
most evident marks both of ignorance 
and falsehood. 

MARTYROLOGY, a catalogue or 
list of martyrs, including the history of 
their lives and sufferings for the sake of 
religion. The term comes from fja^rvp 
" witness," and Ktyu, dico, or uyu colli go. 

The martvrologies draw their mate- 
rials from the calendars of particular 
churches, in which the several festivals 
dedicated to them are marked; and 
which seem to be derived from the 
practice of the ancient Romans, who in- 
serted the names of heroes and great 
men in their fasti, or public registers. 

The martvrologies are very nume- 
rous, and contain many ridiculous and 
even contradictorv narrati\es ; which is 
easily accounted for, if we consider how 
manv forged and spurious accoimts of 
the lives of saints and martyrs appeared 
in tlie first ages of the church, which 
the legendary writers afterwards adopt- 
ed without examining into the tnith of 
them. Howevei', some good critics, of 
late years, have gone a great way to- 
wards clearing the li\es of the saints 
and martyrs from the monstrous heap 
of fiction they laboured under. See ar- 
ticle Legend. 

The martyrology of Eusebius of Cse- 
sarea was the most celebrated in the 
ancient church. It was translated into 
Latin by St. Jerome ; but the learned 
agree that it is not now extant. That 
attril)uted to Beda in the eighth century, 
is of very doubtful authority ; the names 
of sevferal saints being there found who 
did not live till after the time of Beda. 
The nmth centuiy Avas very fertile in 
martyrologies ; then appeared that of 
Floriis, subdeacon of the church at Ly- 
ons; who, however, only filled up the 
chasms in Beda. This was published 
about the year 830, and was followed by 
that of Waldenburtus, monk Of the dio- 
cese of Treves, written in verse about 
the year 848 ; and this by that of Usard, 
a French monk, and written by the 
command of Charles the Bald, iii 875, 
which last is the martyrology now ordi- 
narily used in the Romish church. That 
of Rabanus Maurus is an improvement 
on Beda and Florus, written about the 



year 845 ; that of Noker, monk of St 
Gal, was written about the year 894. 
Tlie martyrology of Ado, monk of Fer- 
riers, in the diocese of Treves, after- 
wards archbishop of Vienne, is a de- 
scendant of the Roman, if we njay so 
call it; for Du SoUier gives its genealo- 
gy thus : — The martyrology of St. Je- 
rome is the great Roiflan martyrology; 
from this was made the little Roman 
one printed by Rosweyd ; of this little 
Roman martyrology was formed that of 
Beda, augmented by Florus. Ado com- 
piled his in the year 858. The mar- 
tyrology of Nevelon monk of Corbie, 
written about the year 1089, is little 
more than an abridgment of that of 
Ado: father Kircher also makes men- 
tion of a Coptic martyrology, preserved 
b}' the Maronites at Rome. 

W'e have also several Protestant mar- 
tyrologies, containing tlie sufferings of 
the reformed, under the Papists, viz. 
an English martyrologv by J. Fox ; 
with others by Clark, Bray, &amp;c. See 
Persecution. 

Martyrology is also used in the Ro- 
mish church for a roll or register kept 
in the \'estiy of each church, containing 
the names of aU'the saints and martyrs 
both of the universal church, and of 
tlie particular ones of that city or mo- 
nastery. 

Martyrology is also applied to the 
painted or written cat:iloguesinthe Ro- 
man chui'ches, containing the founda- 
tions, orbits, praygrs, and masses, to be 
said each day. 

Mx\SORA, a term in the Jewish the- 
ology, signifying a work on the Bible, 
pertormed by several learned rabbins to 
secure it from any alterations which 
might otherwise happen. 

Their work regards merely the letter 
of the^ Hebrew text, in which they have 
first fixed the ti-ue reading by vowels 
and accents ; they have, secondly, num- 
bered not only the chapters and sections, 
but the verses, words, and letters of the 
text: and they find in the Pentateuch 
5245 verses, and in the whole Bible 
23,206. The masoi-a is called by the 
Jews, the hedge or feyice of the law, be- 
cause this enumeration of the verses. 
Sec. is a means of preserving it from be- 
ing corrupted and altered. They have, 
thirdly, marked whatever irregularities 
occur in any of the letters of the He- 
brew text; such as the different size of 
the letters, their various positions and 
inversions, &amp;c. and they have been fruit- 
ful in finding out reasons for these mys- 
teries and irregularities in them. They 
are, fourtlily, supposed to be the au- 
thors of the Ken and Chetibh, or th'

inar8;mal corrections of the text in our 
Hebrew Bibles. 

The text of the sacred books, it is to 
be obsei'verl, was originally written 
■without any bre;'.ks or divisions into 
chapters or vei'ses, or even into words : 
so that a whole book, in the ancient 
manner, was but pne continued word: 
of this kind we ^lave still several an- 
cient manuscripts, both Greek and La- 
tin. In regard, therefore, the sacred 
writings had undergone an infinite 
number of alterations; whence various 
readings had arisen, and the original 
was become much mangled and dis- 
guised, the Jews had recourse to a ca- 
non, which they judged infallible, to fix 
and ascertain the reading of the He- 
brew text; and this rule they call ma- 
sora ; " tradition," fi-om -|D0, iraclit, as if 
this critique were nothing but a ti-adi- 
tion which they had received from their 
forefathers. Accordingly they say, that, 
when God ga\-e the law to' Moses at 
Mount Sinai, he taught him first the 
true reading of it ; and, secondly, its Xxue 
interpretation ; and that both these were 
handed down by oral tradition from ge- 
neration to generation, till at length they 
were committed to writing. The form- 
er of these, viz. the true reading, is the 
subject of the masora; the latter, or 
true interpretation, that of the mishna 
and gemera. 

According to Elias Levita, they were 
the Jews of a famous school at Tiberias, 
about five hundred years after Christ, 
who composed, or at least began, the 
masora ; whence they ai'e called maso- 
rites and masoretic doctors. Aben Ezra 
makes them the authors of the points 
and accents in the Hebrew text, as 
we now find it, and which serve for 
vowels. 

The age of the masorites has been 
much disputed. Archbishop Usher 
places them before Jerome; Capel, at 
the end of the fifth century ; father 
Morin, in the tenth century. Basnage 
says, that they were not a society, but 
a succession of men ; and that the ma- 
sora was the work of many grammarians, 
who, without associating and communi- 
cating their notions, composed this col- 
lection of criticisms on the Hebrew text. 
It is urged, that there were masorites 
from the time of Ezra and the men of 
the great synagogue, to about the year 
of Christ 1030: and that Ben Asher and 
Ben Naphtali, who were the best of the 
profession, and who, according to Bas- 
nage, were the inventors of the masora, 
flourished at this time. Each of these 
published a copy of the whole Hebrew 
text, as correct, says Dr. Prideaux, as 



they could make it. The easteni JeWs 
ha\e followed that of Ben Naphtali, and 
the western that of Ben Asher : and all 
that has been done since is to copy after 
them, without making any more cori'ec- 
tions, or masoretical criticisms. 

The Arabs have done the same thing 
by their Koi-an that the Masorites have 
done by the Bible ; nor do the Jews de- 
ny their having borrowed this expedient 
from the Arabs, who first put it in prac- 
tice in the seventh centuiy. 

There is a great and little masora 
printed at Venice and at Basil, with the 
Hebrew text in a different character. 
Buxtorf has written a masoretic com- 
mentary which he calls Tiberias. 

MASS, Missa, in the church of Rome, 
the office or prayers used at the cele- 
bration of the eucharist ; or, in other 
words, consecrating the bread and wine 
into the body and blood of Christ, and 
offering them, so transubstantiated, as 
an expiatory sacrifice for the quick and 
the dead. 

As the mass is in genera! believed to 
be a representation of the passion of our 
blessed Saviour, so e^ ery action of the 
priest, and every particular part of the 
service, is supposed to allude to the par- 
ticular circumstances of his passion and 
death. 

Nicod, after Baronius, observes, that 
the word comes from the Hebrew inis~ 
sack {ob lat 11711 ;) or from the Latin mis- 
sa missoriim ; because in the former 
times the catechumens and excommu- 
nicated were sent out of the church, 
when the deacons said, Ite, missa, est, 
after sermon and reading of the epistle 
and Gospel ; they not being allowed to 
assist at the consecration. Menage de- 
rives the word from missio, "dismiss- 
ing ;" others from missa, " missing, 
sending ;" because in the mass the 
prayers of men on earth are sent up 
to heaven. 

The general division of masses con- 
sist in high and low. The first Js that 
sung by the choristers, and celebrated 
with the assistance of a deacon and sub- 
deacon : low masses are those in which 
the prayers are barely rehearsed with- 
out singing. 

There are a great number of different 
or occasional masses in the Romish 
church, many of which have nothing 
peculiar but the name: such are the 
masses of the saints ; that of St. Mary 
of the Snow, celebrated on the fifth of 
August ; that of St. Margaret, patron- 
ess of lying-in-women ; that at the feast 
of St. John the Baptist, at which are 
said three masses; that of the Inno- 
cents, at which the g-hria in exrebii

atid hallelujah ar^ omitted, and, it being 
a day of mourning, the altar is of a 
violet colour. As to ordinary masses, 
some are said for the dead, and, as is 
supposed, contribute to fetch the soul 
out of purgatory. At these masses tlic 
altar is put in mourning, and the only 
decorations are a cross in the middle oi 
six yellow wax lights : the dress of the 
celebrant, and the very mass-book, are 
black ; manj' parts of the office are 
omitted, and the people are dismissed 
without the benediction. If the mass be 
said for a person distinguished by his 
rank or virtues, it is followed with a fu- 
neral oration : they erect a chapelle 
ardente, that is, a representation of the 
deceased, with branches and tapers of 
yellow wax, either in the middle of the 
church, or near the deceased's tomb, 
where the priest pronounces a solemn 
absolution of the deceased. There are 
likewise private masses said for stolen 
or strayed goods or cattle, for health, 
for travellers, &amp;c. which go under the 
name of votive masses. There is still 
a further distinction of masses, denomi- 
nated from the countries in which they 
were used : thus the Gothic mass, or 
7)msa 77iosarabum, is that used among 
the Goths when they were masters of 
Spain, and which is still kept up at To- 
ledo and Salamanca; the Ambrosian 
mass is that composed by St. Ambrose, 
and used only at Milan, of which city he 
was bishop ; the Gallic mass used by 
the ancient Gauls ; and the Roman mass, 
used by almost all the churches in the 
Romish communion. 

Mass of the /iresanctified {missa prc£- 
sanctiftcatorum') is a mass peculiar to 
the Cireek church, in which there is no 
consecration of the elements; but, af- 
ter singing some hymns, they receive 
the bread and wine which were before 
consecrated. This mass is performed 
all Lent, except on Saturdays, Sundays, 
and the Annunciation. The priest counts 
upon his fingers, the days of the ensuing 
week on which it is to be celebrated, 
and cuts off as many pieces of bread at 
the altar as he is to say masses ; and 
after having consecrated them, steeps 
them in wine, and puts them in a box ; 
out of which, upon every occasion, he 
takes some of it with a spoon, and, put- 
ting it on a dish, sets it on the altar. 

MASSACRE, a term used to signify 
the sudden and promiscuous butchery 
of a multitude. See Persecution. 

MASSALIANS, or Messalians, a 
sect which spinmg up about the year 
361, in the reign of the emperor Con- 
stantinus, who maintained that men 
have two souls, a celestial and a diabo- 



lical ; and that the latter is driven out 
by prayer. From those words of our 
Lord, "Labour not for the meat that 
perisheth," it is said, that they con- 
cluded they ought not to do any work to 
get their bread. We may suppose, says 
Dr. Joitin, that this sect did not last 
long ; that these sluggards were soon 
starved out of the world ; or, rather, 
that cold and hunger sharpened their 
wits, and taught them to be better inter- 
preters of Scripture. 

MASTER, a person who has ser- 
vants under him ; a i-uler, or instructor. 
The duties ofniastei~s relate to the civil 
concerns of the family. To arrange the 
several businesses required of servants ; 
to give jjarticular instructions for what 
is to be done, and how it is to be done ; 
to take care that no more is required of 
ser\-ants than they are equal to ; to be 
gentle in our deportment towards them ; 
to reprove them when they do wrong, 
to commend them when they do right; 
to make them an adequate recompense 
for their services, as to protettion, main- 
tenance, wages and character. — 2. As 
to the morals of seruants. Masters 
must look well to their servants' cha- 
racters before they hire them ; instiiict 
them in the principles and confirm 
them in the habits of virtue ; watch 
o\er their moi'als, and set them good 
examples. — 3. As to their religious in- 
tei-ests. They shoidd instruct them in 
the knowledge of divine things. Gen. xiv.

dridge's Lee. vol. ii. 266. 

MATERIALISTS, a sect in the an- 
cient church, composed of persons, who, 
being prepossessed with that maxim in 
philosophy, " ex nihilo nihil fit," out of 
nothing nothing can arise, had recourse 
to an eternal matter, on Avhich they sup- 
posed God wrought in the creation, in- 
stead of admitting Him alone as the sole 
cause of the existence of all things. Ter- 
tnllian vigorously opposed them in !iis 
treatise agamst Hermogenes, who wa,s 
one of their numljer. 

3Iaterialists are also those who main- 
•tain that the soul of man is matei-ial, 
or that the principle of perception and 
thought is not a substance distuict from 
the body, but the result of corporeal or- 
ganization. There are others called by 
this name, who have maintained that 
there is nothing but matter in the um- 
verse.

The followers of the late Dr. Priestley 
are considered as Materialists, or philo- 
sophical Necessarians. According to 
the doctor's writings, he believed, — 

1. That man is no more than what we 
now see of him : his being commences 
at the time of his conception, or perhaps 
at an earlier period. The corporeal 
and mental faculties, inhering m the 
same substance, grow, ripen, and decay 
together ; and whenever the system is 
dissolved, it continues in a state of disso- 
lution, till it shall please that Almighty 
Being who called it into existence, to re- 
store it to life again. For if the mental 
principle were, in its own nature, im- 
material and immortal, all its peculiar 
faculties would be so too, whereas we 
see that eveiy faculty of the mind, with- 
out exception, is liable to be impaired, 
and even to become Avholly extinct, be- 
foi'e death. Since, therefore, all the fa- 
cvilties of the mind, separately taken, 
appear to be mortal, the substance, or 
principle, iu which they exist, must be 
pronounced mortal too. Thus we might 
conclude that the body was mortal, 
from observing that all the separate 
senses and limbs were liable to decay 
and perish. 

This system gives a real value to the 
doctrine " of the resurrection from the 
dead, which is peculiar to revelation ; 
on wliich alone the sacred writers bjjld 
all our hope of future life : and it ex- 
plains the uniform language of the 
Scriptures, which sjjeak of one day of 
judgment for all mankind ; and repre- 
sent all the rewards of virtue, and all 
the punishments of vice, as taking place 
at that awful day, and not before. In 
the Scriptures, the heathens are repre- 
sented as without ho])e, and all mankind 
as perishing at death, if there be no re- 
sun'ection of the dead. 

The apostle Paul asserts, in 1 Cor. 
XV. 16. that if the dead rise noty then is 
not Christ risen; mid if Christ be not 
raised, your faith is vain, ye are yet iii 
your sins : then they also who are fallen 
asleefi in Christ are fierished.' And 
again, ver. 32, If the dead rise not let 
us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. 
In the whole discourse, he does not even 
mention the doctrine of happiness or 
misery without the body. 

If we search the Scriptures for pas- 
sages expressive of the state of man at 
death, we shall find such declarations 
as exjjressly exclude any trace of sense, 
thought, or enjoyment. See Ps. vi. 5. 
Job xiv. 7, 8cc. 

2. That there is some fixed law of 
nature respectmg the will as well as 
the other powers of the mind, and 



every thing else in the constitution of 
nature ; and consequently that it is 
never determined without some real or 
apparent cause foreign to itself; i. e. 
without some motive of choice ; or that 
motives influence us in some definite 
and invariable manner, so that every 
volition, or choice, is constantly regu- 
lated and determined by what precedes 
it : and this constant determination of 
mind, according to the motives present- 
ed to it, is what is meant by its necessary 
determination. This being admitted to 
be fact, there will be a necessary con- 
nexion between all things past, present, 
and to come, in the way of proper cause 
and effect, as much in the intellectual as 
in the natural world ; so that according 
to the established laws of nature, no 
event could have been otherwise than it 
has been, or is to be, and therefore all 
things past, present, and to come, are 
precisely what the Author of Nature 
really intended them to be, and has made 
provision for. 

To establish this conclusion, nothing 
is necessary but that throughout all na- 
ture the same consequences should in- 
variably result from the same circum- 
stances. For if this be admitted, it will 
necessarily follow, that at the com- 
mencement of any system, since the se- 
veral parts of it and their respective 
situations were appointed by the Deity, 
the first change would take place ac- 
cording to a certain rule established by 
himself, the result of which would be a 
new situation ; after Avbich the same 
laws containing another change would 
succeed, according to the same rules, 
and so on for ever ; every new situation 
invariably leading to another, and eve- 
ry event, from the commencement to 
the termmation of the system, being 
strictly connected, so that, unless the 
fundamental laws of the system were 
changed, it would be impossible that 
any event should have been otherwise 
than it was. In all tliese cases, the cir- 
cumstances preceding any change are 
called the causes of that change: and 
since a determinate event, or effect, con- 
stantly follows certain circumstances, or 
causes, the connexion between cause 
and effect is concluded to be invariable, 
and therefore necessary. 

It is universally acknowledged, that 
there can be no effect without an ade- 
quate cause. This is even the founda- 
tion on which the only pi-oper argument 
for the being of a God rests. And the 
Necessarian asserts, that if, in any given 
state of mind, with respect both to dis- 
positions and motives, two different de- 
tex'minations, or volitions, be possiblCj it

call be on no other principle, than that 
one of them should come under the de- 
scription of- an effect without a cause ; 
just as if the beam of a balance might 
mcline either way, though loaded with 
equal weights. And if any thing what- 
ever, even a thought in the mind of man, 
could arise without an adequate cause, 
any thing else, the mmd itself, or the 
whole universe, might likewise exist 
witliout an adequate cause. 

This scheme of philosophical neces- 
sity implies a chain of causes and effects 
estmblished by infinite wisdom, and ter- 
minating m the greatest good of the 
whole universe ; evils of all kinds, na- 
tural and moral, being admitted, as far 
as they contribute to that end, or are in 
the nature of thijigs inseparable from it. 
Vice is productive not of good, but of 
evil to us, both here and hereafter, 
though good may result from it to the 
whole system ; and, accordmg to the 
fixed laws of nature, our present and fu- 
ture happiness necessarily depend on 
our cultivatmg good dispositions. 

This scheme of philijsophical neces- 
sity is distinguished fronx the Calvinistic 
doctrine of pi-edestination in the follow- 
ing particulars : 

1. No Necessarian supposes that any 
of the human race will suffer eternally : 
but that future punishments will an- 
swer the same purposes as temporal 
ones are found to do ; all of which tend 
to good, and are evidently admitted for 
that pui-pose. Upon the doctrine of ne- 
cessity, also, the most mdifferent actions 
of men are equally necessary with the 
most important; since every volition, 
like any other effect, must have an ade- 
quate cause depending upon the previ- 
ous state of the mind, and the influence 
to which it is exposed. 

2. The Necessarian believes that his 
own dispositions and actions are the ne- 
cessary and sole means of his present 
and future happiness ; so that, in the 
most proper sense of the words, it de- 

f sends entirely on himself whether he 
)e virtuous or vicious, happy or miser- 
able. 

3. The Calvinistic system entirely ex- 
cludes the popular notion of free-will, 
viz. the liberty or power of doing what 
we please, virtuous or vicious, as be- 
longing to every person, in every situa- 
tion ; which is perfectly consistent with 
the doctrine of philosophical necessity, 
and indeed results from it. ■ 

4. The Necessarian believes nothing 
of the posterity of Adam's shining in 
him, and of their being liable to the 
wrath of God oh that account ; or the 
necessity of aa infinite Being making 



atonement for tliem by suffermg in their 
stead, and thus making the Deity pro- 
pitious to them. He b'elieves nothing of 
all the actions of any man being neces- 
sarily sinful ; but, on the contrary, 
thinks that the very worst of men are 
capable of benevolent intentions in many 
things that they do; and likewise that 
\ery good men are capable of falling 
from virtue, and consequently of smking 
into final perdition. Upon the principles 
of the Necessarian, also, all late repent- 
ance, and especially after long and con- 
firmed habits of vice, is altogether and 
necessarily ineffectual ; there not being 
sufficient time left to produce a change 
of disposition and character, which can 
only be done by a change of conduct of 
proportionably long continuance. 

In short, the three doctrines of Ma- 
terialism, Philosophical Necessity, and 
Socinianism, are considered as equally 

Silts of one system. The scheme of 
ecessitv is the immediate result of the 
materiality of man; for mechanism is 
the undoubted consequence of material- 
ism, and that man is wholly material, is 
eminently subservient to the proper or 
mere humanity of Christ. For if no man 
have a soul distinct trom his body, 
Christ, who in all other respects aj)- 
peared as a man, could not have a soil] 
which had existed before his body : and 
the whole doctrine of the pre-existence 
of souls, of which the opinitm of the pre- 
existence of Christ is a branch, will be 
effectually overturned. See Necessi- 
ty, Pre-existence, Spinosism, Soul, 
Unitarian, and books under those ar- 
ticles. 

MEANS OF GRACE denote those 
duties we perfonn for the purpose of 
improving our minds, affecting our 
liearts, and of obtaining spiritual bless- 
ings ; such as hearing the Gospel, read- 
ing the Scriptures, self-examination, 
meditation, prayer, praise. Christian 
conversation, &amp;c. The means are to 
be used without any reference to merit, 
but solely with a dependence on the 
Divine Being ; nor can we ever expect 
happiness in ourselves, nor be good ex- 
emplars to others, while we live in the 
neglect of them. It is in vain to argue 
that the divine decree supercedes the 
necessity of them, since God has as cer- 
tainly appointed the means as the end. 
Besides, he himself generally works by 
them, and the more means he thinks 
proper to use, the more he displays his 
glorious perfections. Jesus Christ, when 
on earth, used means: he prayed, he 
exhorted, and did good, by going from 
place to place. Indeed, the systems of 
nature, providence, and grace, are alJ

carried on by means. The Scriptures 
tiboiiiid with exhortations tf) them. Matt. 
V. Rom. xii. and none but enthusiasts or 
immoral characters ever refuse' to use 
them. 

MEDIATOR, a person that inter- 
venes between two parties at variance, 
in order to reconcile them. Thus Je- 
sus. Christ is the Mediator between an 
offended God and sinful man, 1 Tim. ii. 
.■5. Both Jews and Gentiles have a no-, 
tion of a Mediator: the Jews call the 
Messiah Xi^lfDN the Mediator or Middle 
One. The Persians call their god Mi- 
thras, jxea-iTns, a Mediator; and the de- 
mons, with the heathens, seem to be, 
according to them, mediators between 
the superior gods and men. Indeed 
the whole religion of Paganism was a 
system of mediation and intercession. 
The idea, therefore, of salvation by a 
Mediator, is not so novel or restricted 
as some imagine ; and the Scriptures of 
truth inform us, that it is only by this 
way human behigs can arrive to eternal 
felicity. Acts iv. 12. John xiv. 6. Man, 
in his state of innocence, was in friend- 
shij) with God ; but, by sinning against 
him, he exposed himself to his just dis- 
pleasure ; his powers became enfeebled, 
and his heart tilled with enmity agairist 
him, Rom. viii. 6 : he was driven out of 
Itis paradisaical Eden, and totally inca- 
pable of returning to God, and making 
satisfaction to his justice. Jesus Christ, 
therefore, was the appointed Mediator 
to bring about reconciliation. Gen. iii. 
12. Col. i. 21 ; and in the fidness of time 
iie came into this world, oljeyed the law, 
satisfied justice, and brought his people 
into a state of grace and favour ; yea, 
, into a more exalted state of friendship 
with God than was lost by the fall, Eph,. 
ii, 18. Now, in order to the accomplish- 
ing of this work, it was necessary th;i.t 
the Mediator should be God and man in 
one person. It was necessary that he 
should be man, 1. That he might be re- 
lated to those he was a Mediator and 
Redeemer of. — 2. That sin might be 
satisfied for, i\nd reconciliation be inade 
for it, in the same nature which sir.ned. 
—3. It was proper that the Mediator 
should be capable of obeying the law 
broken by the sin of man, as a divine 
person could not be subject to the law, 
and yield obedience to it, Gal. iv. 4. 
Rom. V. 19. — 4. It was meet that the 
Mediator should be man, that he might 
be capable of suffering deatli ; for, as 
God, he could not die, and without shed- 
liing of blood there was no remission, 
Heb. ii. 10, 15. vii. 3. — 5. It was fit he 
.siiould be man, ttiat he might be a faith- 
ful high priest, to sympathise with his 



people under all their trials, tempta- 
tions, &amp;c. Heb. ii. 17, 18. Heb. iv. 15.— 
6. It was fit that he should be a holy 
and righteous man, free from all sin, 
original and actual, that he might offer 
himself without spot to God, take away 
the sins of men, and be an advocate for 
them, Heb. vii. 26. ix. 14. 1 John iii. 5. 
But it was not enough to be truly man, 
and an innocent person ; he must be 
more than a man: it was requisite that 
he should be God also, fqr, 1. No mere 
man could have entered into a covenant 
with God to mediate between him ^nd 
sinful men. — 2. He must be God, to 
give virtue and value to his obedience 
and sufferings ; for the sufferings of men 
or angels would not have been sufficient. 
— 3. Being thus God-man, we are eh- 
coui'aged to hope in him. In the person 
of Jesus Christ the object of ti'ust is 
brought nearer to oursehes ; and those 
well-known tender affections which ai'C 
oidy figuratively ascribed to the Deity, 
are in our great Mediator tlioroughly 
realized. Farther, were he God, and 
not man, we should api)ro*;h him witli 
fear and dread ; were he man and not 
God, we should be guilty of idolatry to 
worship and tiiist him at all, Jer. xvii. 5. 
The plan of salvation, therefore, by such 
a Mediator, is the most suitable to hu- 
man beings that possibly could be ; for 
here " Mercy and truth meet together, 
righteousness and peace kiss each 
other." Psal. Ixxxv. 10. The proper- 
ties of Christ as Mediator are these: 
1. He is the only Mediator, 1 Tim. ii. 
4. Praying, therefore, to saints and an- 
gels is an error of the church of Rome, 
and has no countenance from the Scrip- 
ture. — 2. Christ is a Mediator of men 
onl}^ not of angels : good angels need 
not any ; and as for evil angels, none is 
provided nor admitted. — 3. He is the 
Mediator both for Jews and .Gentiles, 
Eph. ii. 18. 1 John ii. 2.-4. He is Me- 
diator both for Old and New Testament 
saints. — 5. He is a suitable, constant, 
willing, and prevalent Mediator; his 
mediation always sticceeds, and is infal- 
lible. GUI's Body of Dh&gt;. vol. i. oct. p.

MEDITATION is an act by which 
we consider any thing closely, or where- 
in the soul is employed in the search or 
consideration of any truth. In i-eligion 
it is used to signify the serious exercise 
of the understanding, whereby our 
thoughts are fixed on the obsen-ation of 
spiritual things, in order to practice.

Mystic divines make a gi'ent difference 
betvveen meditation and contemplation; 
the former consists in discursive acts of 
the soul, considerins? methodically and 
•with attention the mysteries of faith and 
the precepts of morality ; and is per- 
formed by reflections and reasonings 
which leave behind them manifest im- 
pressions on the brain. The pure con- 
templative, they say, have no need, of 
meditation, as seeing all things in God 
at a glance, and without any reflection. 
See Bkguins and Quietists. 

1. Mpclitafioti is a duty which ought 
to be attended to by all who wish well 
to their spiritual interests. It ought to 
be deliberate, close, and fierjietual, Psal. 
cxix. 97. Psal. i, 2. — 2. The subjects 
which ought more especially to engage 
the Christian mind are the works of 
creation, Psal. xix. the pei-fections of 
God. Dent, xxxii. 4 ; the excellencies, 
offices, characters, and works of Christ, 
Heb. xii. 2, 3 ; the offices and opei-a- 
tiftns of the Holy Spirit, John xv. and 
xvi. the various dispensations of Pi'ovi- 
dence, Psal. xcvii. 1,2; the precepts, 
declarations, promises, Sec. of God's 
word, Psal. cxix ; the value, powers, 
and immoitality of the soul, Mark viii. 
."6 ; the noble, beautiful, and benevolent 
plan of the Gospel, 1 Tim. i. 11 ; the 
necessity of our personal ijiterest in and 
experience of its power, John iii. 3 ; the 
depravity of our nature, and the fi-ee- 
dom of divine grace in choosing, adopt- 
ing, justifying, and sanctifying us, 1 Cor. 
vi. 11; the shortness, worth, and swift- 
ness of time, James iv. 14 ; the certainty 
of death, Heb. ix. 27 ; the resurrection 
and judgment to come, 1 Cor. xv. 50, 
8cc. and the future state of eternal re- 
wards and punishments. Matt. xxv. 
Tliese are some of the most important 
subjects on which we should meditate. 
— 3. To perform this duty aright, we 
should be much in prayer, Luke xviii. 
1 ; avoid a worldlv spirit, 1 John ii. 15 ; 
beware of sloth, Heb. vi. 11 ; take heed 
of sensual pleasures, James iv. 4 ; watch 
against the devices of Satan, 1 Pet. v. 
8 ; be often in retirement, Psal. iv. 
4 ; embrace the most fawuralile op- 
portunities, the calmness of the morn- 
ing, Psal. V. 1, 3 ; the solemnity of the 
evening. Gen. xxiv. 63 ; Sabbath days, 
Psal. cxviii. 24 ; sacramental occasions, 
&amp;c. 1 Cor. xi. 28. — 4. The advcDitagrs 
resulting from this are, improvement of 
the faculties of the soul, Prov. xvi. 22 ; 
the aflfections are raised to God, Psalin 
xxxix. 1,4; an enjovment of divine- 
peace and felicity, Phil. iv. 6, 7; holi- 
ness of life is promoted, Psal. cxix. 59, 
60 ; and Ave thereby experience a fore- i 



taste of etenial glory, Psalm Ixxiii. 3j, 

26. 2 Cor. v. 1, &amp;c. 

MEEKNESS, a temper of mind not 
easily pro\ oked to resentment. In the 
Greek lang-uagc it is v^aos quasi, paot fa- 
cilis, easiness of spirit, and thus it may 
be justly called ; for it accommodates 
the soul to every occurrence, and so 
makes a man easy to himself, and to all 
aljout him. The Latins call a meek man 
maiiHuetus, qvi. manu assuetus, used to 
t/ie /land; which alludes to the taming 
and reclaiming of creatures wild by na- 
ture, and bringing them to be ti'actable 
and familiar, James iii. 7, 8 : so where 
the grace of meekness reigns, it sub- 
dues the impetuous disposition, and 
learns it submission and forgiveness. 
It teaches us to govern our own anger 
whenever we are at any time provoked, 
and patiently to bear the anger of others, 
that it ma}' not be a provocation to us. 
The former is its office, especially in 
su])eriors; the latte*' .in inferiors, and 
tx)th in equals, James iii. 13. T/ie ex- 
cellency oj such a sjiirit appears, if we 
consider that it enables us to gain a vic- 
tory over corrupt nature, Prov. xvi. 33 ; 
that it is a beauty and an ornament to 
human beings, 1 Pet. iii. 4; that it is 
obedience to God's word, and con- 
formity to the best patterns, Eph. v. 
1, 2. Phil. iv. 8. It is productive of the 
highest peace to the possessor, Luke 
xxi. 19, Matt. xi. 28, 29. It fits us for 
any duty, uistiniction, relation, condition, 
or persecution, Phil. iv. 11,12. To ob- 
tain this spirit, consider that it is a di- 
vine injunction, Zeph. ii. 3. Col. iii. 12. 
1 Tim. vi. 11. Observe the many ex- 
amples of it ; Jesus Christ, Matt. xi. 28 ; 
Abraham, Gen. xiii. Gen. xvi. 5. 6 ; 
Moses, Numb. xii. 3 ; David, Zech. xii. 
8. 2 Sam. xvi. 10, 12. Ps. cxxxi. • 2 ; 
Paul, 1 Cor. ix. 19. How lovely a spirit 
it is in itself, and how it secures us from 
a variety of evils. That pecuhar pro- 
mises are made to such, Matt. v. 5. Is. 
Ixvi. 2. That such give evidence of 
their being under the influence of di- 
vine grace, and shall enjoy the divine 
blessing. Is. Ivii. 15. See Henry on 
Meekness; Dunlop^s 5er. vol. ii. p."434 ;

MEETING-HOUSE, a place appro- 
priated by Dissenters for the purpose 
of public worship. Since the act of uni- 
formity passed, 1662, by which so many 
hundreds of ministers were ejected from 
their livings, meeting-houses have be- 
come very numei'ous. For a consi-

derable time, indeed, they were prohi- 
bited by the conventicle act ; but, at last, 
toleration being granted to Dissenters, 
they enjoyed the privilege of meeting 
and worshipping God according to the 
dictates of their own consciences, and 
which they still possess to this day. 
The number of meeting-houses in Lon- 
don, may, perhaps, amount to about 150, 
though some reckon upwards of 200. In 
all the respectable towns, and e\'en in 
many villages of England, there are 
meeting-houses ; and, within a few years, 
thev have greatly increased. 

rvIELAIS^CHOLY, sadness or gloom ; 
arising either from the habit of body,' or 
the state of the mind. To remove it, 
the following remedies may be applied, 
1. Early rising. 2. Plain nourishing food. 
3. Exercise in the open air. Or if it 
arises particularly from the mind, 1. 
Associate with the cheerful. 2. Study 
the Scriptures. 3. Consider the amiable 
character of God. 4. Avoid sin. 5. Be 
much in prayer. See Burton, Baxter, 
and Rogers on Melaticholy. 

MELiATONI, so called from one 
Mileto, who taught that not the soul, 
but the body of man, was made after 
God's image. 

MELCHIZEDEZIANS, a denomi- 
nation which arose about the beginning 
of the third century. They afiirmed 
that Melchizedeck was not a man, but a 
Jieavenly power superior to Jesus Christ ; 
for Melchizedeck, they said, was the 
intercessor and mediator of the angels ; 
and Jesus Christ was only so for man, 
and his priesthood only a copy of that of 
Melchizedeck. 

MELCHITES, the name given to 
the Syriac, Egj-ptian, and .other Chris- 
tians of the Levant. The Melchites, 
excepting some few points of little or no 
importance, which relate only to cere- 
monies, and ecclesiastical discipline, are, 
in ev ery respect, professed Greeks ; but 
they are governed by a particular pa- 
triarch, who assiunes the title of Pa- 
triarch of Antioch. They celebrate 
mass in the Arabian language. The re- 
ligious among the Melchites follow the 
rule of St. Basil, the common rule of all 
the Greek monks. 

MELETIANS, the name of a consi- 
derable party who adhered to the cause 
of Meletius, bishop of Lycopolis, in Up- 
per Egypt, after he was deposed, al)out 
the year 306, by Peter, bishop of Alex- 
andria, under the charge of his having 
sacrificed to the gods, and having been 
guilty of other hemous crimes ; though 
Epiphanius makes his only failing to 
have been an excessive severity against 
the lapsed. This dispute, which was at 



first a personal difference between Me- 
letius and Peter, became a religious con- 
troversy ; and the Meletian party sub- 
sisted in the fifth century, but was con- 
demned by the first council of Nice. 

MEMORY, a faculty of the mind, 
which presents to us ideas or notions of 
thuigs that are past, accompanied with 
a persuasion that the things themselves 
wei'e formerly real and present. When 
we remember with little or no effort, it 
is called remembrance simply, or me- 
mory, and sometimes passive memory. 
When we endeavour to rememljer what 
does not immediately and of itself oc- 
cur, it is called active memory, or re- 
collection. A good memoiy has these 
several qualifications: 1. It is ready to 
receive and admit with great ease the 
various ideas, both of words and things, 
which are learned or taught. — 2. It is 
large and copious to treasure up these 
ideas in great number and variety. — 3. 
It is strong and durable to retain,"^ for 
a considerable time, those words •or 
thoughts which are committed to it. — 4. 
It is faithful and aGti\"e to suggest and 
I'ecollect, u])on every proper occasion, 
all those words or thoughts which it 
hath treasured up. As tins faculty may 
be injui'ed by neglect and slothfulness, 
we will here subjoin a few of the best 
rules which have been given for the im- 
provement of it. 1. We should form a 
clear and distinct apprehension of the 
things which we commit to memory. — 

2. Beware of every sort of intemperance, 
for that greatly impairs the faculties. — 

3. If it be weak, we must not overload 
it, but chai'ge it only with the most use- 
ful and solid notions.— 4. We should 
take every opportunity of uttering our 
best thoughts in conversation, as this 
will deeply imprmt them. — 5. We 
should join to the idea we wish to re- 
member, some other idea that is more 
familiar to us, which bears some simili- 
tude to it, either in its nature, or in the 
sound of the word. — 6. We should think 
of it before we go to sleep at night, and 
the first thing in the morning, when the 
faculties are fresh. — 7. Method and re- 
gularity in the things we commit to the 
memory are necessary. — 8. Often think- 
ing, writing, or talking, on the subjects 
we wish to remember. — 9. Fervent and 
frequent pi'ayer. See Watts on the 
Mind, chap. 17 ; Grey's Mcmoria Tech- 
nica ; Rogers' Flmsures of Memory ; 
Reid's Intell. Powers of Man, 303,310, 
338, 356.

branch of Gnostics; thus called from 
.Menander their chief, said by some, 
without sufficient foundation, to have

been a disciple of Simon Magus, and 
himself a reputed magician. 

He taught, that no person could be 
saved unless he were baptised in his 
name ; and he conferred a peculiar sort 
of baptism, which would render those 
who received it immortal in the next 
world ; exhibiting himself to the world 
with the phrenzy of a lunatic more than 
the founder of a' sect as a promised sa- 
viour ; for it appears by the testimonies 
of Irenseus, Justin, and TertuUian, that 
he pi"eter.ded to be one of the scons sent 
from the pleroma, or ecclesiastical re- 
gions, to succour the souls that lay groan- 
mg under bodily oppression and scni- 
tude; and to maintain them against the 
violence and stratagems of the dxmons 
that hold the reins of empire in this 
sublunary world. As this doctrme was 
built upon the same foundation with that 
of Simon Magus, the ancient writers 
looked upon -him as the instiaictor of 
Mejiander. See Simonians. 

MENDICANTS, or Begging Fri- 
ars, several orders of religious in po- 
pish countries, who, having no settled 
revenues, are suppoited by the cha- 
ritable contributions they receive from 
others. 

This sort of society began in the 
thirteenth century, and tlie members of 
it, by the tenor of their institution, were 
to remain entirely destitute of all fix- 
ed revenues and possessions ; though in 
process of time their number became a 
heavy tax upon the people. Innocent 
III. was the first of the popes who per- 
cei\'ed the necessity of instituting such 
an order ; and accordingl)' lie gave such 
monastic societies as made a profession 
of poverty, the most distinguishing 
marks of his protection and favour. 
They were 'also encouraged ai\d patron- 
ized by the succeeding pontiffs, when 
experience had demonstrated their pub- 
lic and extensive usefulness. But when 
it became generally known that they 
had such a peculiar place in the es- 
teem and protection of the rulers of the 
church, their number grew to such an 
enormous and unwieldy multitude, and 
swarmed so prodigiously in all the Eu- 
ropean provinces, that they became a 
burden, not only to the people, but to 
the church itself. The gi'eat inconve- 
nience that arose from the excessive 
^ fcnultiplication of the Mendicant orders 
I 'Vvas remedied by Gregory X., in a ge- 
neral council which he assembled at 
Lyons in 1272; for here all the religious 
orders that had spiimg up after the 
council held at Rome in 1215, under the 
pontificate of Innocent III. were sup- 
pressed ; and the extravagant multitude 



of Mendicants, as Gregoiy called them, 
were reduced to a smaller number, and 
confined to the four following societies 
or denominations, viz. the Dominicans, 
the Franciscans, the Carmelites, and 
the Augustins, or hermits of St. Au- 
gustin. 

As the pontiffs allowed these four 
Mendicant orders the liberty of travel- 
ling whcre\er they- thought proper, of 
conversing with persons of every rank, 
of instructing the youth and multitude 
wherever they went ; and as those 
monks exhibited, in their outward ap- 
pearance and manners of life, more 
striking mrrks of griivity and holiness 
than were observable in the other mo- 
nastic societies, they rose all at once to 
the very summit of fame, and were re- 
garded with the utmost esteem and 
veneration through all the countries of 
Europe. The enthusiastic attachment 
to these sanctimonious beggars Avent so 
far, that, as we learn from the most 
authentic recoixls, several cities were 
di\'ided or cimtoned out into four parts, 
with a view to tiiese four orders: the 
first pai't being assigned to the Domini- 
cans, the second to the Franciscans, 
the third to the Carmelites, and the 
fourth to the Augustins. The people 
were unwilling to receive the sacra- 
ments from any other hands than 
those of the Mendicants, to whose 
churches they crowded to perform 
their devotions while living, and were 
extremely desirous to deposit there 
also their i-emains after death. Nor 
did the inliuence and credit of the Men- 
dicants end here ; for we find in the his- 
tory of this and of the succeeding ages, 
that they vv'ere employed not only in 
spiritual matters, but also in temporal 
and political affairs of the greatest con- 
sequence, in composing the differences 
of princes, concluding treaties of peace, 
concerting alliances, presiding in cabinet 
councils, governing courts, levying taxes, 
and other occupations, not only remote 
from, but absolutely inconsistent with 
the monastic character and profession. 
However, the power of the Dominicans 
and Franciscans greatly surpassed that 
of the other two orders, insomuch that 
these two orders were, before the re- 
formation, what the Jesuits have been 
since that happy and glorious period; 
the very soul of the hierarchy, the en- 
gines of the state, the secret springs of 
all the motions of the one and the other, 
and the authors and directors of every 
gi-eat and important event, both in the 
religious and political world. By very- 
quick progression their pride and con- 
sequence arrived at such a pitch, that

they Viad the presumption to declare 
publicly, that they had a divine impulse 
and commission to illustrate; and main- 
tain the religion of Jesus. They treated 
\fith. the utmost insolence and contempt 
all the different orders of the priest- 
hood ; they affirmed, without a blush, 
that the true method of obtaining sal- 
vation was revealed to theiu alone ; 
proclaimed with ostentation the supe- 
rior efficacy and virtue of their indul- 
gences; and vaunted beyond measure 
their interest at tlie court of heaven, 
and their familiar connexions with the 
Supreme Beuig, the Virgin Mar)', and 
the saints in glory. By these impious 
wiles they so deluded and captivated 
the miserable, and blinded the multi- 
tude, that thc\" would not intrust any 
other but the ^Vlendicants with the care 
of their souls. They retained their 
credit and influence to such a degree 
towards tlie close of the fourteenth 
century, that great numbers of both 
sexes, some in health, others in a state 
of infirmity, others at the point of death, 
earnestly desired to be admitted into 
the Mendicant order, which they look- 
ed upon as a sure and infallible method 
of rendering heaven propitious. — Many 
made it an essential part of their last 
wills, that their bodies after death 
should be wrapped in old ragged Domi- 
nican or Franciscan habits, and interred 
among the Mendicants. For such was 
the barbarous superstition and wretched 
ignorance of this age, that people uni- 
versally believed they should readily 
obtain mercy from Christ at the day 
of judgment, if they appeared before 
his tribunal associated with the Mendi- 
cant friars. 

About this time, however, they fell 
under an uniAersal odium ; but, being 
resolutely protected against all opposi- 
tion, whether open or secret, by the 
popes, who regarded them as their best 
friends, and most effectual supports, 
they suffered little or nothing from the 
efforts of their numerous adversaries. 
In the fifteenth century, besides their 
aiTOgance, which was excessive, a quar- 
relsome and litigious spirit prevailed 
among them, and drew upon them justly 
the displeasure and indignation of many. 
By affording refuge at this time to the 
Beguins in their order, they became of- 
fensive to the bisliops, and were herebv 
involved in difficulties and perplexities 
of various kinds. I'hey lost their credit 
in the sixteenth century by their iiistic 
impudence, their ridiculous superstitions, 
their ignorance, cnielty, and brutish 
manners. They discovered the most 
barbarous aversion to the aj'ts aiid scien- 



ces, and expressed a like abhorrence of 
certain eminent and learned men, who 
endeavoured to open the paths of science 
to the pursuits of the studious youth, re- 
commended the culture of the mind, 
and attacked the barbarism of the age 
in their Avrithigs and discourses. Their 
general character, together with other 
circumstances, concurred to render a 
reformation desirable, and to accomplish 
this happy e^'ent. 

Among the number of Mendicants are 
also ranked the Capuchins, Recollects, 
Minims, and others, who are branches 
or derivations from the former. 

Buchanan tells us, the Mendicants in 
Scotland, undei' an appearance of beg- 
gary, lived a very luxurious life ; whence 
one wittily called them not Aleiidicant, 
but Mamliicant friars. 

MENN0^7TES, a sect in the Unit- 
ed Provinces, in most respects the same 
with those in other places. called Ana- 
ba/Uists. They had their rise in 1536, 
when Menno Simon, a native of Fries- 
land, who had been a Romish priest, 
and a notorious profligate, resigned his 
rank and office in the Romish church, 
and publicly emliraced the communion 
of the Anabaptists. 

Menno was born at Witmarsura, a 
village in the neighbourhood of Bols- 
wert, in Friesland, in the year 1505, 
and died in 1561, in the duchy of Hol- 
stein, at the country-seat of a certain 
nobleman, not far from the city of Ol- 
desloe, who, moved with compassion by 
the view of the perils to which Men- 
no was exposed, and the snares that 
were daily laid for his ruin, took him, 
with certain of his associates, into his 
protection, and gave him an asylum. 
The writings of Menno, which are al- 
most all composed in the Dutch lan- 
guage, were published in folio at Am- 
sterdam, in the year 1651. About the 
yeai' 1537, Menno was earnestly solicit- 
ed by many of the sect with which he 
connected himself, to assume among 
them the rank and functions of a jjublic 
teacher ; and, as he looked upon the 
persons who made this proposal to be 
exempt from the fanatical phrenzy of 
their brethren at Munster (though ac- 
cording to other accounts they were 
originally of the same stamp, only ren- 
dered somewhat wiser by their suffer- 
ings) he yielded to their entreaties. | 
From this period to the end of his life " 
he travelled from one country to ano- 
ther with his wife and children, exer- 
cising his ministry, under pressures and 
calamities of various kinds, that suc- 
ceeded each other without interruption, 
and constantly exposed to the danger

of falling a victim to the severity of the 
laws. East and West Friesland, together 
with tlie province of Gronigen, were 
first visited by this zealous apostle of 
the Anabaptists; from whence he di- 
rected his couree into Holland, Guel- 
derland, Brabant and Westphalia ; con- 
tinued it through the German provinces 
that lie on the coast of the Baltic sea, 
and penetrated so far as Livonia. In 
all these places his ministerial labours 
were attended with remarkable suc- 
cess, and added to his sect a pi'odigious 
number of followers. Hence he is de- 
servedly considered as the common 
chief of almost all the Anabafitists, and 
the parent of the sect that still subsists 
under tliat denomination. Menno was 
a man of genius, though not of a very 
sound judgment : he possessed a natural 
and persuasive eloquence, and such a 
degree of learning as made him pass 
for an oracle in the estimation of the 
multitude. He appears, moreover, to 
have been a man of probity, of a meek 
and tractable spirit, gentle in his man- 
ners, pliable and obsequious in his com- 
merce with persons of all ranks and 
characters, and extremely, zealous in 
promoting practical religion and virtue, 
which he recommended by his exam- 
ple as well as by his precepts. The 
plan of doctrine and disciphne drawn 
up by Menno was of a much more mild 
and moderate nature than that of the 
furious and fanatical Anabaptists (whose 
tumultuous proceedings have been re- 
cited under that article,) but somewhat 
more severe, though more clear and 
consistent than the doctrine of the wiser 
branches of that sect, who aimed at 
nothing moi-e than the restoration of 
the Christian church to its primitive 
purity. Accordingly, he condemned the 
plan of ecclesiastical discipline that was 
Founded on the prospect of a new king- 
dom, to be miraculously established 
by Jesus Christ on the ruins of civil 
government, and the destruction of hu- 
man rulers, and which had been the 
fatal and pestilential soiu'ce of such 
dreadful commotions, such execrable 
rebellions, and such, enormous crimes. 
He declared publicly his dislike of that 
doctrine which pomted out the ap- 
proach of a marvellous reformation m 
the church by the means of a new 
and extraordinary effusion of the Holy 
Spirit. He expi'essed his abhorrence 
of the licentious tenets which several 
ef the Anabaptists had maintainecTwith 
respect to the lawfulness of polygamy 
and divorce; and, finally, considered 
as unworthy of toleration those fanatics 
who. were of opinion, that the Holy 



Ghost continued to descend into the 
minds of many chosen believers, in as 
extraordinary a manner as he did at 
the first establishment of the Christian 
church, and that he testified his pecu- 
liar presence to several of the faithful, 
by miracles, predictions, dreams, and 
visions of various kinds. He retained, 
indeed, the doctrines commonly receiv- 
ed among the Anabaptists, in relation 
to the baptism of infants; the milltn~ 
nium, or one thousand years' reign of 
Christ upon earth ; the exclusion of 
magistrates from the Christian church ; 
the abolition of war; and the prohibi- 
tion of oath enjoined by our Saviour; 
and the vanity, as well as the pernicious 
effects of human science. But while 
Menno I'etajned these doctrines in a 
general sense, he explained and modified 
them in such a manner as made them 
resemble the religious tenets that were 
universally received in the Protestant 
churches ; and this rendered them 
agreeable to many, and made them ap- 
pear inoffensive even to numbei's who 
had no inclination to embrace them. 
It, however, so happened, that the na- 
ture of the doctrines considered in them- 
selves, the eloquence of Menno, which 
set them off" to such advantage, and the 
circumstances of the times, gave a high 
degree of credit to the religious system 
of this famous teacher among the Ana- 
baptists, so that it made a rapid pro- 
gress in that sect. And thus it was 'u\ 
consequence of the ministry of Menno, 
that the diffei-ent sorts Anabaptists 
agreed together in excluding from their 
communion the fanatics that dishonour- 
ed it, and in renouncing all tenets that 
were detrimental to the authority of 
civil government, and by an unexpected 
coalition formed themselves into one 
community. 

Though the Mennonites usually pass 
for a sect of Anabaptists, yet M. Her- 
man Schyn, a Mennonite minister, who 
has published their histoiy and apology, 
maintains, that they are not Anabaptists 
either by principle oroi'igin. Howe\er, 
nothing can be more certain than this 
fact, viz. that the first Mennonite con- 
gregations were composed of the differ- 
ent sorts of Anabaptists; of those who 
had been always inoffensive and upright, 
and of those who, before their conver- 
sion by the ministry of Menno, had been 
seditious fanatics ; besides, it is alleged, 
that the Mennonites do actually retain 
at this day some of those opinions and 
doctrines which led the seditious and 
turbulent Anabaptists of old to the com- 
mission of so maTiy and such enonnous 
crimes ; such particularly is the doctrine 
Yy

concerning the nature of Christ's kiug- 
tlom, or of the church of the New Tes- 
tament, though modified in such a man- 
ner as to have lost its noxious qualities, 
and to be no longer pernicious in its in- 
fluence. 

The Mennonites are subdivided into 
several sects, whereof the two principal 
are the Flandrian^, or Fleniingians, 
and the IVaierkmdians. The opinions, 
says Mosheim, that are held m common 
by the Mennonites, seem to be all deriv- 
ed from this fundamental principle, — 
that the kingdom which Christ esta- 
blished upon earth is a visible church, 
or community, into which the holy and 
just alone are to be admitted ; and 
which is consequently exempt from all 
those institutions and ndes of disci- 
plme that have been in\'ented by hu- 
man wisdom for the correction and re- 
formation of the wicked. This prin- 
ciple, indeed, was avowed by the an- 
cient Mennonites, but it is now almost 
wholly renounced: nevertheless, from 
this ancient doctrine many of the reli- 
gious opinions that distinguish the Men- 
nonites from all other Christian com- 
munities seem to be derived. In con- 
sequence of this doctrine, they admit 
none to the sacrament of baptism but 
persons that are come to the full use 
of their reason ; they neither admit 
civil rulers into their communion, nor 
allow any of their members to perfonn 
the functions of magistracy; they deny 
the lawfidness of repelling force by 
force ; and consider war, in all its shapes, 
as unchristian and unjust: thev enter- 
tain the utmost aversion to the exe- 
cution of justice, and more especially 
to capital punishments : and they also 
refuse to confirm their testimony by 
an oath. The particular sentiments 
that divided the more considerable so- 
cieties of the Mennonites, are the fol- 
lowing: The rigid Mennonites, called 
the Flevmgicnis, maintain with various 
degrees of rigour the opinions of their 
founder, Menno, as to the human na- 
ture of Christ, alleging that it was 
E reduced in the womb of the Virgin 
y the creating power of the Holy 
Ghost; the obligation that binds us to 
■wash the feet of strangers, in conse- 
quence of ovu' Saviour's command : the 
necessity of excommunicating and avoid- 
ing, as one would do the plague, not 
only avowed sinnei-s, but also all those 
who depart, even in some light in- 
stances pertaimng to dress, 8cc. from 
the simplicity of their ancestors; the 
contempt due to human learning ; and 
other matters of less moment. How- 
C\tr, this austere system declines, and 



the rigid Mennonites are gradually ap- 
proaching towards the opinions and dis- 
cipline of the more moderate, or Water- 
landians. 

The first settlement of the Menno- 
nites in the United Provinces was grant- 
ed them by William, prince of Orange, 
towards the close of the sixteenth cen- 
tmy ; but it was not before the follow- 
ing centun' that their liberty and tran- 
.quillity were fixed upon solid founda- 
tions, when, by a cnnfc-sion of faith pub- 
lished hi the year 1626, they cleared 
themselves from the imputations of 
those pernicious and detestable eiTors 
that had been laid to their charge. Iri 
order to appease their intestine dis- 
cords, a consideritble part of the Ana- 
baptists of Flanders, Germany, and 
Friesland, concluded their debates in a 
conference held at Amsterdam in the 
year 1630, and entered into the bonds of 
fraternal communion, each reserving to 
themselves a liberty of retaining certain 
opinic»is. This association was rcnevved 
and confirmed by new resolutions in the 
year 1649 ; in consequence of which the 
rigorous laws of Menno and his success- 
ors were in. various respects mitigated 
and corrected. See Anabaptists. 

MEN OF UNDERSTANDING. 
This title distinguished a denomination 
which appeared in Flanders and Brus- 
sels in the year 1511. They owed their 
origin to an illiterate man, whose name 
was Egidius Cantor, and to William of 
Hildenison, a Carmelite monk. They 
pretended to lie honoured with celestial 
visions, denied that any could ari'ive at 
perfect knowledge of the Holy Scrip- 
tures without the extraordinary suc- 
cours of a divine illumination, and de- 
clared the apjjroach of a new re^•ela- 
tion from heaven, more perfect than the 
Gospel of Christ. They said that the 
resurrection was accomplished in the 
person of Jesus, and no other was to be 
expected ; that the inward man was not 
defiled by the outward actions, what- 
ever they were ; that the pains of hell 
were to have an end ; and not only all 
mankind, but -even the devils them- 
selves were to return to God, and be 
made partakers of eternal felicity. They 
also tauflit among other things, that 
Clu'ist "alone had merited eternal life 
and felicity for the human I'ace ; and 
tliat therefore men could not acquire 
this inestimable privilege by their own 
action: alone — that the priests to whom 
the people confessed their trangressions, 
had not the power of absolving them, but 
this authority Avas vested in Chi'ist alone 
— that voluntary penance and niortifica- 
tion was not necessaiy to salvation. 



MER

MER 



This denomination appears to have 
been a branch of the Brethren and Sis- 
ters of the Free Spii*t. - 

MERCY is that disposition of mind 
which excites us t(^ pity and reheve 
those who are in trouble, or to pass by 
their crimes without punishing them. It 
is distinguished from love, thus: The 
object or love is the creature simply ; 
the object of mercy is the creature fallen 
into misery. Parents love their children 
simply as they are their children; but 
if they fall into misery, love woi-ks m a 
way of pity and compassion: love is 
turned mto mercy. 

" As we are all the objects of mercy 
in one degi'ee ov another, the mutual 
exercise of it towards each other is ne- 
cessaiy to preserve. the harmony and 
happiness of society. But there are 
those who may be moi-e particularh' 
considered as the objects oiit; such as 
the guilty, the indigent, and the misera- 
ble. As it respects the guilty, the great- 
est mercy we can show to them is to 
endeavour to reclaim them, and prevent 
the bad consequences of their miscon- 
duct, James v. 20. Mercy may also be 
shown to them by a proper mitigation 
of justice, and not extending the punish- 
ment beyond the nature or desert of 
the crime. With regard to those who 
arc in necessity and want, mercy calls 
upon us to afford the. most suitable and 
seasonable supplies ; and here bur bene- 
factions must be dispensed in pi-opor- 
tion to our caxumstances, and the real 
distress of the object, 1 John iii. 17. As 
to those who are in misery and distrrss, 
mercy prompts us to relieve and com- 
fort them by doing what we can to re- 
move or alleviate their burdens. Our 
Lord strongly recommended this act of 
mercy in the para.ble of the mian who 
fell among tlueves, arid was relieved by 
the poor Samaritan : and in the conclu- 
sion he adds, ' Go and do thou likewise,' 
Luke X. 30 — 37. 

"This merciful temper will show and 
exert itself not only towards those of 
our ovm party and acquaintance, but to 
the whole human species; and not only 
to the whole human species, l)ut to the 
animal creation. It is a decree of inhu- 
manity to take a pleasure m giving any 
thing pain, and more in putting usefid 
animals to extreme toi'ture for our ov/ii 
sjiort. This is not that dominion which 
God originally ga\'e to man over the 
beasts of the field. It- is, therefore, an 
usurpea authority, which man has no 
right to exercise over brute creatures, 
which were made for his service, con- 
venience, su])port, and ease ; but not for 
the gratification of unla&gt;vful passions, or 
eruel dispositions. 



"Mercy must be distinguished from 
those weaknesses of a natural temper 
which often jjut on the appearance of it. 
With i-egard to criminals or delinquents, 
it is false compassion to suppress the sa- 
lutary admonition, and refuse to set their 
guilt before them, merely because the 
sight of it will gi\'e their conscience 
pain: such unseasonable tenderness in 
a surgeon may prove the death of his 
patient: this, however it may appear, 
IS not mercy, but cruelty. So is that 
fondness of a parent that withholds the 
hand of discipline from a beloved child, 
when its frowardncss and faults render 
seasonable and prudent correction ne- 
cessaiy to save it from ruin. In like 
manner, v/hen a magistrate, thi'ough 
excessive clemency, suffers a crimmal 
who is a pest to society to escape un- 
punished, or so mitigates the sentence 
of the law as to put it into his power to 
do still greater hurt to others, he vio- 
lates not only the laws of justice, but of 
mercy too. 

"Mercy to the indigent and neces- 
sitous has been no less abused and per- 
verted by acts of mistaken beneficence, 
when impudence and clamour are per- 
mitted to extort from the hand of cha- 
rity that relief v/hich is due to silent 
distress and modest merit; or when one 
oljject is lavishly relieved to the detri- 
ment of another who is more deserving 
As it respects those who are in tribula- 
tion or misery, to be sure,'evejy such 
person is an object of our compa'jsion ; 
but that compassion may be, and often 
is, exercised in a wrong manner. Some 
arc of so tender a make, that they can- 
not bear the sight of distress, and stand 
aloof from a fj-iend in pam and affliction, 
because it affects them too sensibly, 
when their presence would at least give 
them some little comfort, and might 
possibly administer lasting relief. This 
weakness should be opposed, because it 
not only looks like unkindness to our 
friends, but is really showuig more ten- 
derness to ourselves than to them : ner 
is it doing as we would be done by. 
Again; it is false pity, when," out of 
mere tenderness of nature, we either 
advise or permit our afflicted friend to 
take or do any thmg which will give 
him a little present transient ease, but 
which we know at the same time will 
increase his future pain, and aggravate 
the symptoms of his disease." Seeing, 
therefore, the extremes to which we 
are liable, let us learn to cultivate that 
wisdom aiid prudence which are neces- 
sary to regulate this virtue. To he just: 
without being cruel, and merciful with- 
out being weak, sliould be our constant.

indigence, and misery, which present 
themselves to our view. See Benefi- 
cence, Charity, Love. 

MERCY OF GOD is his readiness 
to relieve the miserable and to pardon 
the guilty. 1. It is essential to his na- 
ture, Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7 ; not, indeed, as 
a passion or affection, as it is in men, 
but the result of his sovereign will, and 
guided by his infinite wisdom. — 2. It is 
free, as nothing out of himself can be 
the cause of it ; for then there would be 
a cause prior to him, the cause of hun- 
self. The misery of the creature is not 
the cause of mercy, for he is not wrought 
upon as creatures are, nor are the me- 
rits of the ci-eature the cause, Tit. iii. 
5 ; nor ai-e even the sufferings of Christ 
the cause, but the effects of it; but it 
arises from the goodnesS of his nature, 
and i" om his sovei"eign will and plea- 
sure, Exod. xxxiii. 19. Rom. ix. 18. — 
n. His mercy is infinite; it pardons of- 
fences committed against an infinitely 
holy Being, and bestows an infinite good 
on all who believe, even Jesus Christ, 
Luke i. 78. — 4-. It is immutable ; nothing 
can change it ; it is invariably the same, 
Mai. iii. 6. Luke i. 50. — 5. Shall be for 
ever celebrated in a future state, Psal. 
Ixxxix. 2. ciii. 17. — 6. It is only display- 
ed in and through Christ, Eph. ii. It has 
been farther distinguished nito, 1. Pre- 
venting mercy, Psal. lix. 10. — 2. For- 
bearing mercy, Rom. ii. 4. — 3. Comfort- 
ing mercy, 2 Cor. i. 4. — 4. Relieving 
mercy, Psal. cxlv. 8, 9. — 5. Paixloning 
mercy, Is. Iv. 6. — 6. Universal or exten- 
sive mercy. It extends to all kiiids of 
beings and fallen creatures. The bnite 
creation share in it, Psal. cxlv. 9. xxxvi. 
5, 6. The ungodly are the objects of it 
in a general way, Matt. v. 45. 1 Tim. 
iv. 10. The saints on earth are continual 
monuments of it, Rom. ix. 23 ; and the 
spirits of just men made perfect in 

flory ai-e always praising God for it. 
'inally, it is enjoyed in an especial 
manner by all who are true believers, 
of every nation, in every age, in every 
circumstance, in all places, and at all

their pay ; which they might properly 
be said to do, be&lt;iause they yielded in 
real service an equivalent to the state 
for the stipend J^iey received, which 
was thei-efore due to them in justice. 
Here, then, we come at the tiiie mean- 
ing of the word vierit; from which it is 
very clearly to be seen that there can 
be ho such thing as merit in our best 
obedience. One man may merit of ano- 
ther, but .all mankind together cannot 
merit from the hand of God. This evi- 
dently appears, if we consider the im- 
perfections of all our services, and the 
express declaration of the divine word,

MERITS OF CHRIST, a term used 
to denote the active and passive obe- 
dience of Christ; all that he wrought 
and all that he suffered for the salva- 
tion of mankind. See articles Atone- 
BiENT, Imputation, Righteousness 
OF Christ. 

MESSIAH signifies anointed, the ti- 
tle given by way of eminence to our Sa- 
viour; meaning the same in Hebrew as 
Christ in Cxreek, and alludes to the au- 
thority he had to assume the characters 
of prophet, priest, and king, and that of 
Saviour of the world. The ancient Jews 
had just notions of the Messiah, which 
came gradually to be corrupted, by ex- 
pecting a tempoi-al monarch and con- 
queror; and finding Jesus Christ to be 
poor, humble, and of an unpromising 
appearance, they rejected him. Most of 
the modern rabtjins, according to Bux- 
torf, believe that the Messiah is come, 
but that he lies concealed because of 
the sins of the Jews. Others believe he 
is not yet come, fixing different times 
for his appearance, many of which are 
elapsed; and, being thus baffled, have 
pronounced an anathema against those 
who shall pretend to calculate the time 
of his coming. To reconcile the prophe- 
cies concerning the Messiah that seem- 
ed to be contradictory, some have had 
recourse to a twofold Messiah ; one in 
a state of poverty and suffering, the 
other of splendor and glory. The first, 
thev say, is to proceed from the tribe of 
Ephraim, who is to fight against Gog, 
and to be slain by Annillus, Zech. xii. 10 ; 
the second is to be of the tribe of Judah 
and lineage of David, who is to conquer 
and kill Annillus; to bring the first 
Messiah to life again, to assemble all 
Israel, and rule over the whole world.

That Jesus Christ is the ti-ue Mes- 
siah, and actually come in the flesh is 
evident, if we consider (as Mr. Fuller 
observes) that it is intimated that wlien- 
ever he should come, the sacrifices and 
ceremonies of the Mosaic law were to 
be superseded by him, Ps. xl. 6 — 8 ; 1 
Sam. XV. 22 ; Dan. ix. 27; Jer. xxxi. 31, 
34; Heb. viii. 13. Now sacrifice and 
oblation have ceased. They virtually 
ceased when Jesus offered himself a sa- 
crifice, and in a few years after, they 
actually ceased. A few of the ancient 
ceremonies are indeed adhered to, but 
as one of the Jewish writers acknow- 
ledges, "The sacrifices of the Holy 
Temjile have ceased." Let every JevV 
therefore, ask himself this question. 
Should Messiah the Prince come at 
some future period, how are the sacri- 
fice and oblation to cease on his ap- 
pearance, when they have already ceas- 
ed near 1800 years. 

Again, it is suggested in the Scrip- 
ture, that the great body of sacred pro- 
phecy should be accomplished in him ; 
Gen.iii. 16; xxii. 18 ; Is. xlix. 10. hii. 1. 
The time when he was to come is clear- 
ly marked out in prophecv : ' Is. xhx. 
10; Hag. ii. 6— 9; Dan. ix. 24. He ac- 
tually came according to that time. — 2. 
The place where Messiah should be 
bom, and where he should principally 
impart his doctrine is determmed ; Mic. 
V. 2 ; Is. ix. 2 ; and was literally fulfilled 
in Jesus. — 3. The house or family from 
whom he should descend is cI- arly as- 
certained. So much is said of his de- 
scenduig from David, that we need not 
refer to particular proofs ; and the ra- 
ther as no Jew will deny it. The gene- 
alogies of Matthew and Luke, whatever 
varieties there are between them, agree 
in tracing his pedigree to David. And 
though, in both it is traced in the name 
of Joseph, yet this appears to be only in 
conformity to the Jewish custom of 
tracing no pedigree in the name of a 
female. Tlie father of Joseph, as men- 
tioned,by Luke, seems to have been his 
father by marriage only ; so that it was, 
in reality, Mary's pedigree that is trac- 
ed by Luke, though under her husband's 
name ; and this being the natural line of 
descent, and that of Matthew the legal 
one, by which, as a king lie would have 
inherited the crown, there is no incon- 
sistency between them. — 4. The kind 
of miracles that Messiah should per- 
form is specified ; Is. xxxv. 5, 6. He ac- 
tually performed the miracles there pre- 
dicted, his enemies themselves being 
judges. — 5. It was prophesied that he 
should as a King be distinguished by his 
towliness; entering into Jerusalem, not 



in a chariot of state, but in a much hum- 
bler style ; Zech. ix. 9 ; this was really 
the case. Matt. xxi. 6. It was predictfed 
that he should suffer and die by the 
hands of wicked men ; Is. xlix. 7 ; liii. 
9 ; Dan. ix. 26. Nothing could be a more 
striking fulfilment of prophecy than the 
treatment the Messiah met with in al- 
most every particular circumstance. — 
7. It was foretold that he should rise 
from the dead ; Is. liii. 11. Ps. Ixviii. 18. 
xvi. 10, his resurrection is proved by in- 
dubitable evidence. — 8. It was foretold 
that the great body of the Jewish nation 
would not believe in him, and that he 
Avould set up his kingdom among the 
Gentiles ; Is. liii. 1. xlix. 4 — 6. vi. 9 — 12. 
Never was a prophecy more complete- 
ly fulfilled than this, as facts evidently 
prove. 

Lastly, it is declared that when the 
Messiah should come, the will of God 
would be perfectly fulfilled by him, Is. 
xlii. 1, 49.- Is. 3 — 5. And what was his 
whole life but perfect conformity to 
him ? He finished the work the Father 
gave him to do : never was there such 
a character seen among men. Well 
thei'efore may we saj^, Truly this was 
the Son of God. See article Christi- 
anity, Jesus Christ. 

There have been numerous false Mes- 
siahs wliich have ainsen at different 
times. Of these the Saviour predicted, 
Matt. xxiv. 14. Some have reckoned as 
many as twenty -four, of whom we shall 
here give an account. 

1. Caziba was the first of any note 
who made a noise in the world. Being 
dissatisfied with the state of things un- 
der Adrian, he set himself up at the 
head of the Jewish nation, and pro- 
claimed himself their long expected 
Messiah. He was one of those banditti 
that infested Judea, and committed all 
kinds of violence against the Romans; 
and had become so powerful, that he 
was chosen king of the Jews, and by 
them acknoAvledged their Messiah. — 
However, to facilitate the success of 
this bold enterprise, he changed his 
name from Caziba, which it was at first, 
to that of Barchocheba, alluding to the 
star foretold by Balaam ; for he pre- 
tended to be the star sent from heaven 
to restore his nation to its ancient liber- 
ty and glory. He chose a forerunner, 
raised an zvrxw, was anointed king, coin- 
ed money inscribed with his own name, 
and proclaimed himself Messiah and 
prince of the Jewish nation. _ Adi'iaii 
raised an armv, and sent it against him. 
He retired into a town called Bithei*, 
where he was besieged. Barchocheba 
was killed in the siege, the city was ta-

ken, and a dreadful havoc succeeded. 
The Jews themselves allow, that, dur- 
ing this short war against the Romans, 
in defence of this felse Messiah, they 
lost five or six hundred thousand souls. 
This was in the former part of the se- 
cond century. 

2. In the reign of Theodosius the 
younger, in the year of. our Lord 434, 
another impostor arose, called Moses 
Cretensis. He pretended to be a second 
Moses, sent to delivfer the Jews who 
dwelt in Crete, and promised to divide 
the sea, and give them a safe passage 
through it. Their delusion proved so 
strong and universal, that they neglect- 
ed their lands, houses, and all other con- 
cerns, and took only so much with them 
as they could con\'tniently carry. And 
on the day appointed, this false Moses, 
having led them to the top of a -rock, 
men, women, and children, threw them- 
selves headlong down into the sea, with- 
out the least hesitation or leluctance, 
till so great a numl^er of them were 
drowned, as opened the eyes of the rest, 
and made them sensible of the cheat. 
They then began to look out for their 
pretended leader, but he disappeared, 
and escaped out of their hand. 

3. In the reign of Justin, about 520, 
another impostor appeared, whocallecl 
himself the son of Moses. His name 
■was Dunaan. He entered into a city of 
Ai'abia Felix, aiid there he greatly op- 
pressed the Christians ; but he was ta- 
ken prisoner, and put to death by Eles- 
ban, an i-Eihiopian general. 

4. In the year 529 the Jews and Sa- 
maritans rebelled against the emperor 
Justinian, and set up one Julian for their 
'king ; and accounted him the Messiah. 
The emperor sent an army against 
them, killed great numljers of them, 
took their pretended Messiah prisoner, 
and immediately put him to death. 

5. In the year 571 was born Mahomet, 
in Arabia. At first he professed himself 
to be the Messiah who was pi'omised to 
the Jews. By this means he drew many 
of that unhappy people after him. In 
some sense, therefore, he may be con- 
sidered in the number of false Messiahs. 
See Mahomf.tanism. 

6. About the year 721, in the time of 
Leo Isaurus, arose another false Mes- 
siah in Spain ; his name; was Serenus. 
He drew great numbers after him, to 
their no small loss and disappointment, 
but all his pretensions came to nothii^. 

7. The twelfth century was fruitful in 
false Messiahs : for about the year 1137, 
there appeared one in France, who was 
put to death, and many of those who 
followed him. 



8. In the year 1138 the Persians'were 
disturbed with a Jew, who called him- 
self the Messiah. He collected together 
a vast ai-my. But he, too, was put to 
death, and his followere treated with 
great inhumanity. 

9. In the year 1157, a false Messiah 
stirred up "the Jews at Corduba, in 
Spain. T he wiser and better sort look- 
ed upon him as a madman, but the great 
body of the Jews in that nation believed 
in him. On this occasion almost all the 
Jews in Spain were destroyed. 

10. In the year 1167, another false 
Messiah rose in the kingdom of Fez, 
which brought great trouble and perse- 
cution upon the Jews that were scat- 
tered through that country. 

11. In the same year an Arabian set 
up there for the Messiah, and pretend- 
ed to work miracle*. \\'hen search was 
made for him, his followers fled, 'and 
he was brought before the Arabian king. 
Being questioned by him, he replied, 
that he was a prophet sent from God. 
The king then asked him what sign he 
could show to confirm his mission. Cut 
oit my head, said he, and I will return 

to life again. The king took him at his / 
word, promising to believe him if his ' 
j)rediction came to pass. The poor 
wretch, however, never rctunied to life 
again, and the cheat was sufficiently 
disco\ered. I'hose who had been de- 
luded by him were grievously punished, 
and the nation condemned to a veiy 
heavy .'".■le. 

12. &gt;iot long after this, a Jew who 
dwelt beyond Euphrates, called himself 
the Messiah, and drew vast multitudes 
of people after him. He gave this foi' 
a sign of it, that he had been leprous, 
and was cured in the course of one night. 
He, like the rest, perished ui the at- 
tempt, and brought great persecution on 
his countrymen. 

13. In the year 1174, a magician and 
false Christ arose .in Persia, who was 
called Da\id Almusser. He pretended 
that he could make himself in,viiible; 
but he -vas soon taken and put tg death, 
and a heavy fine laid upon his brethren 
the Jews. 

14. In the year 1176, another of these 
impostors arose in ^Moravia, who was 
Cidled David Almusser. He pretended 
that he could make himself invisible; 
but he was soon taken and j)ut to death, 
and a heavy fine laid upon his brethren 
the Jews. 

15. In the year 1199, a famous cheat 
and rebel exerted himself in Persia, 
called David el David. He was a man 
of learning, a great magician, and pre- 
tended to be the Messiah. He i-aised an

anny against the king, but was taken 
and imprisoned ; and, having made his 
escape, was afterwards seized again, 
and beheaded. Vast numbers of the 
Jews were butchered for taking part 
with this impostor. 

16. We are told of another false 
Christ in this same century by Maimp- 
iiides' and Solomon: but they take no 
notice either of his name, countrj-, or 
good or ill success. 

Here we may observe, that no less 
than ten false Chi-ists arose in the 
twelfth centmy, and brought- prodigious 
calamities and destniction upon the 
Jews in various quarters of the world. 

17. In the year 1497, we find another 
false Christ, ' whose name was Ismael 
Sophus, who deluded the Jews in Spain. 
He also pei-ished, and as many as be- 
lieved in him were dispersed. 

18. In the year 1500, Rabbi Lemlem, 
a German Jew ef Austria, declared him- 
self a forerunner of the Messiah, and 

Sailed down his own oven, promising 
is brethren that they should bake their 
bread in the Holy Land next year. 

19.- In the year 1509, one whose name 
was Plefferkorn, a Jew of Cologne, pre- 
tended to be the Messiah. He after- 
wards aflPected, however, to turn Chris- 
tian. 

20. In the year 1534, Rabbi Salomo 
Malcho, giA'ing out that he was the 
Messiah, was burnt to death by Charles 
the Fifth of Spain. 

21. In the year 1615, a false Christ 
arose in the East Indies, and was greatly 
foUowed by the Portuguese Jews, who 
were scattered over that countiy. 

22. In the year 1624, another in the 
Low Countries pretended to be the 
Messiah of the Famih^ of David, and of 
the line of Nathan. He promised to de- 
stroy Rome, and to overthrow the king- 
dom of Antichrist, and the Turkish 
empire. 

23. In the year 1666, appeared the 
false Messiah Sabatai Sevi, who made 
so great a noise, and gained such a 
number of proselytes. He was born at 
Aleppo, imposed on the Jews for a con- 
siderable tune ; but afterwards, with a 
view of saving his life, turned Mahome- 
tan, and was at last beheaded. As the 
history of this impostor is more enter- 
taining than that. of those we have 
already mentioned, I will give it at some 
length. 

The year 1666 was a year of great 
expectation, and some wonderful thing 
was looked for by many. This was a 
fit time for an impostor to set up ; and, 
accordmgly, lying I'eports were earned 
about. It was said, that great multi- 



tudes marched from unknown parts to 
the remote deserts of Arabia, and they 
were supposed to be the ten tribes of 
Israel, who had been dispersed for 
many ages ; tliat a ship was arrived in 
the north part of Scotland with sails 
and cordage of silk ; that the mariners 
spake nothing but Hebrew ; that on the 
sails was this motto, The twelve tribes 
of lyael. Thus were credulous men 
possessed at that time. 

Then it was that Sabatai Sevi appear- 
ed at Smynia, and prt)fessed himself to 
be the Messias. He promised the Jews 
deliverance and a prosperous kingdom. 
This which he promised they firmly be- 
lieved. The Jews now attended to no 
business, discoursed of nothing- but their 
return, and believed Sabatai to be the 
Messias as firmly as we Christians be- 
lieve any article of faith. A right i-eve- 
rend person, then in Turkey, meeting 
with a Jew of his acquaintance at Aleppo, 
he asked him what he thought of Sa- 
batai. The Jew replied, that he believ- 
ed him to be the Messias ; and that he 
was so far of that belief, that, if he should 
p^rove an impostor, he would then tuni 
Christian. It is fit Ave should be parti- 
cular in this relation, because the his- 
toiy is -so very surprising and remarka- 
ble ; and we have the account of it from 
those who were in Turkey. 

Sabatai Sevi was the son of Mordecai 
Sevi, a mean Jew of Smyrna. Sabatai 
was A^ery bookish, and arri\ed to great 
skill in the Hebrew learning. He was 
the author of a new doctrine, and for 
it was expelled the citv. He Avent 
thence to Salonichi, of old'called Thes- 
salonica, Avhere he married a very hand- 
some Avoman, and Avas diAorce'd from 
her. Then he travelled into the Morea, 
then to Ti-ipoli, Gaza, and Jerusalem. 
By the Avay he picked up a third wife. 
At Jerusalem he began to reform the 
JcAA^s' constitutions, and abolish one of 
their solemn fasts, and communicated 
his designs of professing huTiself the 
Messias to one Nathan. He was pleased 
Avith it, and set up for his Elias, or fore - 
i-unnei% and took upon him to abolish 
all the JcAvish fasts, as not beseeming, 
Avhen the bridegroom was noAv come, 
Nathan prophesied that tke Messias 
should appear before the Grand 
Seignior in less than tAvo years, and 
take from him his croAvn, and lead hin» 
in chains. 

At Gaza, Sabatai preached repent- 
ance, together Avith a faith in himself, 
so effectually, that tlie people gavf 
themselves up to their dcA-otions anct 
alms. The noise of this Messias began, 
to fill all places. Sabatai xxovf resoh e-:

for Smyrna, and then for Constantinople, 
Nathan writes to him from Damascus, 
and thus he begins his letter; "To the 
king, our king, lord of lords, who ga- 
thers the dispersed of Israel, who re- 
deems our captivity, the man elevated 
to the height of all sublimity, the Mes- 
sias of the God of Jacob, the true Mes- 
sias, the celestial l^ion, Sabatai Sevi." 

And now, throughout Turkey,, the 
Jews were in great expectation' of glo- 
i"ious times. They now were devout and 
penitent, that they might not obstruct 
the good which they hoped for. 

Some fasted so long that they were 
famished to death ; others buried them- 
selves in the earth till their limbs grew 
stiff; some would endure melting wax 
dropped on their flesh ; some rolled in 
snow; others, in a cold season, would 
put themselves into cold water ; and 
many buried themselves. Business was 
laid aside; superfluities of household 
utensils were sold ; the poor were pro- 
vided for by immense contributions. 
Sabatai comes to Smyrna, where he 
was adored by the people, though the 
Chacham contradicted him, for which 
he was removed from his office. There 
he in writing styles himself the only and 
first-born Son of God, the Messias, the 
Saviour of Israel. And tliough he met 
with some opposition, yet he prevailed 
there at last to that degree, that some 
of his followers prophesied, and fell 
into strange ecstacies: four hundred 
men and women prophes'^d of his 
gi'owing kingdom; and young infants, 
who could hardly speak, would plainly 
pronounce Sabatai, Messias, and Son of 
God. The people were for a time pos- 
sessed, and voices heard from their 
bowels : some fell into trances, foamed 
at the mouth, recounted their future 
prosperity, their visions of the Ijion of 
Judan, and th^ triumphs of Sabatai. 
All which, says the relator, were cer- 
tainly true, being eifects of diabolical 
delusions, as the Jews themselves have 
since confessed. 

Now the impostor swells and assumes. 
Whereas the Jews, in their synagogues, 
were wont to pray for the Grand 
Seignior, he orders those prayers to 
be foi'bornq»for*the future, thinking it 
an indecent thing to pray for him who 
was shortly to be his captive ; and, in- 
stead of praying for the Turkish empe- 
X'or, he appoints prayers for himself. 
He also -elected princes to govern the 
Jews in their march towards the Holy 
Land, and to minister justice to them 
when they should be possessed of it. 
These princes were men well known in 
the citv of Smvi-na at that time. The 



people were now pressing to see Some 
miracle to confinn their faith, and to 
convince the Gentiles. Here the im- 
postor was puzzled, though any jugghng 
trick would ha\e served their turn. 
But the credulous people supplied this 
defect. When Sabatai was before the 
Cadi (or justice of peace,) some affiraied 
they saw a piUar of fti'e between him 
and tlie Cadi; and after some had af- 
firmed it, others were ready to swear 
it, and did swear it also ; and this was 
presently believed by the Jews of that 
city. He that did not now believe him 
to be the Messias was to be shunned as 
an excommunicated person. The im- 
postor now declares that he was called 
of God to see Constantinople, where he 
had much to do. He ships himself, to 
that end, in a Tui'kish saick, in January, 
1666. He had a long and troublesome 
voyage; he had not power over the 
sea and wmds. The Visier, upon the 
news, sends for him, and confines him 
in a loathsome prison. The Jews pay. 
him their visits; and they of this city 
are as infatuated as those in Smyrna. 
They forbid traflic and refuse to pay 
their debts. Some of our English mei-- 
chants not knowing how to recover 
their debts from the Jews, took this oc- 
casion to visit Sabatai, and make their 
complaints to him against his subjects; 
whereupon he wrote the following letter 
to the Jews. 

" To you of the nation of the Jews, 
who expect the appearance of the 
Messias, and the salvation of Israel, 
peace without end. \Miereas we are 
mformed that you are indebted to seve- 
ral of the English nation, it seemeth 
right unto us to order you to make satis- 
faction to these your just debts, which if 
you refuse to do, and not obey us here- 
in, know you that then you are not 
to enter with us mto our joys and do- 
minions." 

Sabatai remained a prisoner in Con- 
stantinople for the space of two months. 
The Grand Visiei-, designing for Candia, 
thought it not safe to leave him in the 
city during the Grand Seignior's absence 
and his own. He, therefore, removed 
him to the Dardanelli, a better air in- 
deed, but yet out of the way, and conse- 
quently importing less danger to the 
city ; which occasioned the Jews to con- 
chide that tlie Turks could not, or durst 
not, take away his life ; which had, they 
concluded, been the svxrest way to have 
removed all jealousy. The Jews flocked 
in great numbers to the castle where he 
was a prisoner ; not only those that were 
near, but from Poland, Germany, Leg- 
horn, Venice, and otlier places: they 



MES 



361 



MES 



received Sabatai's blessing, and promi- 
ses of advancement. The Turks made 
use of this confluence ; they raised the 
price of their lodgings and provisions, 
and put their price upon those who 
desired to see Sabatai for their admit- 
tance. This profit stopped their mouths, 
and no complaints were for this cause 
sent to Adrianople. 

Sabatai, in his confinement, appoints 
the manner of his own nativity. He 
commands the Jews to keep it on the 
ninth day of the month Ab, and to make 
it a day of great joy, to celebrate it with 
pleasing meats and drinks, with illumi- 
nations and music. He obligeth them 
to acknowledge the love of God, in 
giving them that day of consolation for 
the birth of their king Messias, Sabatai 
Sevi, his servant and first-born Son in 
love. 

We may observe, by the way, the 
insolence of this impostor. This day 
was a solemn day of fasting among the 
Jews, formei'ly in memory of the burn- 
ing of the temple by the Chaldees: 
several other sad things happened in 
this month, as the Jews observe ; that 
then, and upon the same day, the second 
temple was destroyed ; and that in this 
month it was decreed in the wilderness 
that the Israelites should not enter into 
Canaan, &amp;c. Sabatai was born on this 
day ; and, therefore, the fast must be 
turned to a feast ; whereas, in truth, it 
had been well for the Jews had he not 
been bom at all ; and much better for 
himself, as will appear from what 
follows. 

The Jews of that city paid Sabatai 
Sevi great respect. They decked their 
synagogues witli S. S. in letters of gold, 
and made for him in the wall a crown : 
they attributed the same titles and pro- 

Ehecies to him which we apply to our 
aviour. He was also, during this im- 
prisonment, visited by pilgrims from all 
parts, that had heard his story. Among 
whom Nehemiah Cohen, from Poland, 
was one, a man of great learning in the 
Kabbala and eastern tongues ; who de- 
sired a conference with Sabatai, and at 
the conference maintained, that accord- 
ing to the Scrmture, there ought to be 
a two-fold Messias ; one the son of 
Ephraim, a poor and despised teacher 
of the law ; the other the son of David, 
to be a conquei'or. Nehemiah was con- 
tent to be the former, the son of 
Ephraim, and to leave the glory and 
dignity of the latter to Sabatai. Sabatai, 
for what appears, did not dislike this. 
But here lay the ground of the quarrel : 
Nehemiah taught that the son of 
Ephraim oHght to be the forerunner i 



of the son of David, and to usher him 
in ; and Nehemiah accused Sabatai of 
too gi'eat forwardness in appearing as 
the son of David, before the son of 
Ephraim had led him the way. Sabatai 
could not brook this doctrine ; for he 
might fear that the son of Ephraim, 
who was to lead the way, might pre- 
tend to be the son of David, and so leave 
him in the lurch ; and, therefore, he 
excluded him from any part or shai'e in 
this mattei" ; which was the occasion of 
the ruin of Sabatai, and all his glorious 
designs. Nehemiah, being disappoint- 
ed, goes to Adrianople, and informs 
the great ministers of state against Sa- 
batai, as a lewd and dangerous person 
to the government, and that it was ne- 
cessary to take him out of the way. 
The Grand Seignior, being informed of 
tliis, sends for Sabatai, who, much de- 
jected, appears before him. The Grand 
Seignior requires a miracle, and chooses 
one himself; and it was tWs: that Sa- 
batai should be stripped naked, and set 
as a mark for his archers to shoot at ; 
and, if the arrows did not pierce his 
flesh, he would own him to be the Mes- 
sias. Saljatai had not faith enough to 
bear up under so gi*eat a trial. The 
Grand Seignior let him know that he 
would forthwith impale him, and that 
the stake was pi'epared for him, unless 
he would turn Turk. Upon which he 
consented to turn Mahometan, to the 
great confusion of the Jews. And yet 
some of the Jews were so vain as to 
affirm tliat it was not Sabatai himself, 
but his shadow, that professed the reli- 
gion, and v/as seen m the habit of a 
Turk ; so great was their obstinacy and 
infidelity, as if it were a thing impossi- 
ble to convince these deluded and in- 
fatuated wretches. 

After all this, several of the Jews con- 
tinued to use the forms, in their public 
worship prescribed by this Mahometan 
Messias, which obliged the principal 
Jews of Constantinople to send to the 
synagogue of Smyrna to foi-bid thii 
practice. During these things, the Jews, 
mstead of minding their trade and 
traffic, filled their letters with news of 
Sabatai their Messias, and his wonder- 
ful works. Thev reported, that, wlien 
the Grand Seignior sent to take him, 
he caused all the messengers that were 
sent to die ; and when other Janizaries 
were sent, tliey all fell dead by a word 
from his mouth ; and being requested 
to do it, he caused them to revive again. 
They added, that, though the prison 
where Sabatai lay was barred and fast- 
ened with strong iron locks, yet he was 
seen to walk thi'ough the streets Avith a 



MET

numerous train; that the shackles 
which were upon his neck and feet did 
not fall off, but were turned into gold, 
with which Sabatai gratified his follow- 
ers. Upon the fame of these things the 
Jews of Italy sent legates to Smyrna, to 
enquire into the ti'uth of these matters. 
When the legates arrived at Smyrna, 
they heard of the news that Sabatai 
was turned Turk, to their very great 
confusion; but, going to visit the brother 
of Sabatai, he endeavoured to persuade 
them that Sabatai was still the tnie 
Messias ; that it was not Sabatai that 
went about in the habit of a Turk, but 
his angel, or spirit ; that his body was 
taken into heaven, and should be sent 
down again when God should think it 
a fit season. He added, that Nathan, 
his forerunner, who had wrought many 
miracles, would soon be at Smyrna ; 
that he would reveal hidden things to 
them, and confirm them. But this Elias 
was not suffered to come into Smyrna, 
and though the legates saw him else- 
where, they recei\'ed no satisfaction 
at all. 

24. The last false Christ that had 
made any considerable number of con- 
verts was one Rabbi Mordecai, a Jew 
of Germany : he appeared in the year 
1632. It was not long before he was 
found out to be an impostor, and was 
obliged to fly from Italy to Poland to 
save his life." What became of him af- 
terwards does not seem to be recorded. 

This may be considered as true and 
exact an account of the false Christs 
that have arisen since the crucifixion of 
our blessed Saviour, as can well be given.

METHODIST, a name applied to 
different sects, both Papists and Protes- 
tants. — 1. The popish Methodists were 
those polemical doctors who arose in 
France about the middle of the seven- 
teenth century, in opposition to the Hu- 
guenots, or Protestants. These Metho- 
dists, from their different manner of 
treating the controversy with their op- 
ponents, may be divided into two classes. 
The one comprehends those doctors 
whose method of disputing with the 
Protestants was disingenuous and unrea- 
sonable; and who followed the exam- 
ple of those military chiefs, who shut 



up their troops in intrenchments and 
strong holds, in order to cover them 
from the attacks of the enemy. Of this 
number were the Jesuit Veron, who 
required the Protestants to prove the 
tenets of their church by plain pas- 
sages of Scripture, without being allow- 
ed the 1 iberty of illustrating those pas- 
sages, reasoning upon them, or draw- 
ing any conclusions from them ; Nihu- 
sius, an apostate from the Protestant 
religion ; the two Wallenburgs, and 
others, who confined themselves to the 
business of answering objections ; and 
cardinal Richlieu, who confined the 
whole controversy to the single article 
of the divine institution and authority 
of the church —2. The Methodists of 
the second class were of opinion, that 
the most expedient manner of reducing 
the Protestants to silence, was not to at- 
tack them by piecemeal, but to over* 
whelm them at once by the weight of 
some genei'al principle, or presumption, 
or some universal argument, which 
comprehended or might be applied to 
all the points contested between the two 
churches ; thus imitating the conduct 
of those military leaders, who, instead 
of spending their time and strength in 
sieges and skirmishes, endeavoured to 
put an end to the war by a general and 
decisive action. Some of these polemics 
rested the defence of pojiery upon 
prescription ; others upon tlie wicked 
lives of Pi'otestant princes who had left 
tlie church of Rome ; others, the crime 
of religious schism ; the variety of opi- 
nions among Protestants with regard to 
doctrine and discipline, and the unifor- 
mity of the tenets and worship of the 
church of Rome ; and thus, by urging 
their respective arguments, they thought 
they should stop the mouths of their 
advei saries at once. 

METHODISTS, PROTESTANT, 
origin of. It is not generally known 
that the name of Methodist had been 
given long before to a religious sect in 
England, or at least, to a party in reli- 
gion which was distinguished by some 
of the same marks aa are now sup- 
posed to apply to the Methodists. John 
Spence, who was librarian of Sion Col- 
lege in 1657, in a book which he publish- 
ed, says, " Where are now our Ana- 
baptists and plain pike staff Metho- 
dists, who esteem all flov/ers of rhetoric 
in sermons no better than stinking 
weeds?" — But the denomination to 
which we here refer, was founded, in 
the vear 1729, bv one Mr. Morgan and 
Mr. "John Wesley. In the n-.^mtli of 
November that year, the latter being 
then fellow of Lincoln College, began 



MET 



363 



MET 



to spend some evenings in reading the 
Greek Testament, with Charles Wes- 
ley, student, Mr. Morgan, commoner of 
Christ Church, and Mr. Kirkham, of 
Merton College. Not long afterwards, 
two or three of the pupils of Mr. John 
Wesley obtained leave to attend these 
meetings. They then began to visit the 
sick in different parts of the town, and 
the prisoners also, who were confined 
in the castle. Two years after they 
were joined bv Mr. Ingham, of Queen's 
College, Mr. Broughton, and Mr. Her- 
vey ; and, in 1735, by the celebrated 
Mr. Whitfield, then in his eighteenth 
year. At this time their number in Ox- 
ford amounted to about fourteen. They 
obtained their name from the exact 
regularity of their lives, which gave oc- 
casion to a young gentleman of Christ 
Church to say, " Here is a new sect of 
Methodists sprung up ;" alluding to a 
sect of ancient physicians who were 
called Methodists because they reduced 
the whole healing art to a few common 
principles, and brought it into some 
method and order. 

At the time that this society was 
foraied, it was said that the whole king- 
dom of England was tending fast to in- 
fidelity. " It is come," says Bishop But- 
ler, " 1 know not how, to be taken for 
granted by many persons, that Chris- 
tianity is not so much as a suliject of en- 
quiry ; but that it is now at length dis- 
covered to be fictitious ; and accordingly 
they treat it as if, in the present age, 
this were an agreement among all peo- 
ple of discernment, and nothing remain- 
ed but to set it up as a principal subject 
of mii'th and ridicule, as it were, by way 
of reprisal for its having so long inter- 
nipted the pleasui'es of the world." 
There is eveiy reason to believe that 
the Methodists were the instruments of 
stemming this toi-rent. The sick and 
the poor also tasted the fruits of their 
labours and benevolence : Mr. Wesley 
abridged himself of all his superfluities, 
and proposed a fund for the relief of the 
indigent; and so prosperous was the 
scheme, that they quickly increased 
their fund to eighty pounds per annum. 
This, which one should have thought 
would have been attended with praise 
instead of censure, quickly drew upon 
them a kind of persecution ; some of 
the seniors of the university began to in- 
terfere, and it was reported " that the 
college censor was going to blow up 
the godly club.'" They found them- 
selves, however, patronized and encou- 
raged by some, men eminent for their 
learning and virtue ; so that the society 
still continuedj though they had suffered 



a severe loss, in 1730, by the death of 
Mr. Morgan, who, it is said, was the 
founder of it. In October, 1735, John 
and Charles Wesley, Mr. Ingham, and 
Mr. Delamotte, son of a merchant in 
London, embarked for Geoi-gia, in order 
to preach the Gospel to the Indians. 
After their arrival they were at first 
favourably received, but in a short time 
lost the affection of the people ; and, on 
account of some differences with the 
store-keeper, Mr. Wesley was obliged 
to return to England. Mr. Wesley, how- 
ever, was soon succeeded by Mr. Whit- 
field, whose repeated labours in that 
part of the woi'ld are well known. 

II. Methodists, tenets of. After Mr. 
Whitfield returned from America iu 
1741, !ie declared his full assent to the 
doctrines of Calvin. Mr. Wesley, on 
the contrary, professed the Arminian 
doctrine, and had printed, in favour of 
perfection and universal redemption, 
and very stronglv against election, a 
doctrine which Mr. Whitfield believed 
to be unscriptural. The difference, 
therefore, of sentiments between these 
two great men caused a separation. Mr. 
Wesley preached in a place called the 
Foundery, where Mr. Whitfield preach- 
{ ed but once, and no more. Mr. Whit- 
field then preached ta very large con- 
gregations out of doors ; and soon after, 
in connection with Mr. Cennick, and 
one or two more, began a new house, in 
Kingswood, Gloucestei-shire, and es- 
tablished a school that favoured Cal- 
vinistical preachers. The Methodists, 
therefore, were now divided ; one part 
following Mr. Wesley, and the other 
Ml . Whitfield. 

The doctrines of the Wesleyan Me- 
thodists, according to their own account, 
are the same as the church of England, 
as set foi'th in hei- liturgy, articles, and 
homilies. Tliis, however, has been dis- 
puted. Mr. Wesley, in his appeal to men 
of reason and religion, thus declares his 
sentiments : " All I teach," he observes, 
" respects either the nature and condi- 
tion of justification, the nature and con- 
dition of salvation, the nature of justify- 
! ing and saving faith, or the Author of 
I faith and salvation. That justification 
j whereof our articles and homilies speak 
I signifies present forgiveness, and conse- 
! quently acceptance with God : I Ijelieve 
the condition of this is faith: I mean 
1 not only that without faith we cannot be 
1 justified, but also that, as soon as any 
j one has true faith, in that moment he is 
I justified. Good works follow this faith, 
j but cannot go before it ; much less can 
i sanctification, which implies a continued 
; course of good Avorks, springing Ixovs^

holiness of heart. But it is allowed that 
sanctification goes before our justihca- 
tion at the last day, Heb. xii. 14. Re- 
pentance, and fruits meet for repent- 
ance, go befoi-e faith. Repentance ab- 
solutely must go before faith ; fruits 
meet for it, if there be opportunity. By 
repentance I mean conviction of sin, 
producing real desires and sincere re- 
solutions of amendment ; by salvation I 
mean not barely deliverance from hell, 
but a present deliverance from sin. 
Faith, in general, is a divine supernatu- 
ral evidence, or conviction of things not 
seen, not discoverable by our bodily 
senses : justifying faith implies not only 
a divine evidence or conviction that God 
"was in Christ reconciling the world un- 
to himself, but a sure trust and confi- 
dence that Christ died for my sins, that 
he loved me, and gave himself for me. 
And the moment a penitent sinner be- 
lieves this, God pardons and absolves 
him ; and as soon as his pardon or justi- 
fication is witnessed to hnn by the Holy 
Ghost, he is saved. From that time (un- 
less he make shipwreck of the faith) sal- 
vation gradually increases in his soul. 

" The Author of faith and salvation 
is God alone. There is no more of power 
than of merit in man; but as all merit is 
in the Son of God, in what he has done 
and suflFered for us, so all power is in the 
Spirit of God. And, therefore, every 
man, in order to believe unto salvation, 
nuist receive the Holy Ghost." So far 
Mr. Wesley. Respecting original sin, 
free Avill, the justification of men, good 
woi'ks, and works done before justifica- 
tion, he refers us to what is said on these 
subjects in the former part of the ninth, 
the tenth, the eleventh, the twelfth, and 
thirteenth articles of the church of 
England. One of Mr. Wesley's preach- 
ers bears this testimony of him and his 
sentiments: "The Gospel, considered 
as a general plan of salvation, he viewed 
as a display of the divine perfections, in 
a way agreeable to the nature of God ; 
in which all the divine attributes harmo- 
nize, and shine forth with peculiar lus- 
tre. — The Gospel, considered as a means 
to attain an end, appeared to him to dis- 
cover as great fitness in the means to 
the end as can possibly be discovered in 
the stiiicture of natural bodies, or in the 
various operations of nature, from a 
view of which we draw our arguments 
for the existence of God. — Man he 
viewed as blind, ignorant, wandering out 
of the way, with his mind estranged 
from God. — He considered the Gos])el 
as a dispensation of mercy to men, hold- 
ing forth pardon, a free pardon of sin to 
all who repent and believe m Christ] 



Jesus. The Gospel, he believed, incul- 
cates universal holiness, both in heart 
and in the conduct of life. — He showed 
a mind well instructed in the oracles of 
God, and well acquainted with human 
nature. He contended, that the first 
step to be a Christian is to repent ; and 
that, till a man is convinced of the evil 
of sin, and is determined to depart from 
it ; till he is convinced that there is a 
beauty in holiness, and something tiidy 
desirable in being reconciled to God, he 
is not prepared to receive Christ. The 
second important and necessary step, he 
believed to be faith, agreeable to the 
order of the apostle, 'Repentance to- 
ward God, and faith toward our Lord 
Jesus Christ,' Acts xx. 20, 21. In ex- 
plaining sanctification, he accurately 
distinguished it from justification, or the 
pardon of sin. Justification admits us 
into a state of grace and fa^-our with 
God, and lays the foundation of sancti- 
fication, or Christian holiness, in all its 
extent. There has been a great cla- 
mour raised against him because he 
called his view of sanctification by the 
word perfection; but he often explain- 
ed what he meant by this term. He 
meant by the word perfection, such a 
degree of the love of God, and the love 
of man ; such a degree of the love of 
justice, truth, holiness, and purity, as 
will remove from the heart every con- 
trary disposition towards God or man ; 
and that this should be our state of 
mind in eveiy situation and in every 
circumstance of life. — He mamtained 
that God is a God of love, not to a part 
of his creatuTes only, but to all ; that He 
who is the Father of all, who made all, 
who stands in the same relation to all 
his creatures, loves them all ; that he 
loved the world, and gave his Son a 
ransom for all without distinction of 
persons. It appeared to him, that to re- 
present God as partial, as confining his 
love to a few, was unworthy our notions 
of the Deity. He maintained that Christ 
died for all men ; and that he is to be 
oftcred to all ; that all are to be invited 
to come to him : and that whosoever 
comes in the way which God has ap- 
pointed may pai'take of his blessings, 
lie supposed that sufficient grace is 
given to all, in that way and manner 
wliich is Ijcst adapted to influence the 
mind. He did not believe salvation was 
by works. So far was he from putting 
vvoi-ks in the place of the blood of Christ, 
that he only gave them their just value : 
he considei-ed them as the fruits of a 
living operative faith, aftd as the mea- 
sure of our future reward; for every 
man will be rewarded not for his woiks,

but according to the measuve of them. 
He gave the whole glory of salvation to 
God, from first to last. He believed 
that man would never turn to God, if 
God did not begin the worli : he often 
said that the first approaches of grace 
to the mind are irresistible ; that is, that 
a man cannot avoid being convinced 
that he is a sinner ; that God, hy va- 
rious means, awakens his conscience ; 
and whether the man will or no, these 
convictions approach him." In order 
that we may form still clearer ideas 
respecting Mr. Wesley's opinions, we 
shall here quote a few questions and 
answers as laid down in the Minutes 
of Conference. Q. " In what sense is 
Adam's sin imputed to all mankind?" 
A. " In Adam all die, i. e. 1. Our bo- 
dies then became mortal. — 2. Our souls 
died, i. e. were disunited from God. And 
hence, — 3. We are all bora with a sin- 
ful, devilish nature ; by reason whereef, 
— 4. W^e are children of wrath, liable to 
death eternal," Rom. v. 18. Eph. ii. 3. 
Q. "In what sense is the righteousness 
of Christ imputed to all mankind, or to 
believers i"' A. "»We do not find it ex- 
pressly affirmed in Scripture that God 
imputes the righteousness of Christ to 
an^', although we do find thut faith is 
imputed for righteousness. That text, 
' As by one man's disobedience all men 
were made sinners, so by the obedience 
of one all were made righteous,' we con- 
ceive, means by the merits of Christ all 
men are cleared from the guilt of Adam's 
actual sin." Q. " Can faith be lost but 
through disobedience ?" A. " It cannot. 
A believer first inwardly disobeys ; in- 
clines to sin with his heart ; then his in- 
tercourse with God is cut off, i. e. his 
faith is lost ; and after this he may fall 
into outward sin, being now weak, and 
like another man." Q. "What is im- 
plied in being a. perfect Christian?^'' A. 
" The loving the Lord our God with all 
our heart, and with all our mind, and 
soul, and strength." Q. "Does this im- 
ply that all inward sin is taken away ?" 
A. " Without doubt ; or how could we 
be said to be ?,a.\cd.from all our unclean- 
72esses?" Ezek. xxxvi. 29. Q. " How 
much is allowed by our brethren who 
differ from us with regard to entire sanc- 
tijication?" A. "They grant, 1. That 
every one must be entirely sanctified in 
the article of death. — 2. That till then 
a believer daily grows in grace, comes 
nearer and nearer to perfection. — 3. 
That we ought to be continually press- 
ing after this, and to exhort all others to 
do so." Q. "What do we allow them ?" 
A. "We grant, 1. That many of those 
who have died in the faith, yea, the 



greater part of those we have known, 
wei-e not sanctified throughout, not made 
perfect in lo\e, till a little before death. 
— 2. That the term sancti^fied is con- 
tinually applied by St. Paul to all that 
were justified, that were true believers. 
— 3. That by this term alone he rarely 
(if ever) means saved from all sin. — 4. 
That consequently it is not proper to 
use it in this sense, without adding the 
word ' wholly, entirely,' or the like. — 5. 
That the inspii-ed writers almost con- 
tinually speak of or to those who were 
justified, but very i-arely either of or to 
those who were sanctified. — 6. That 
consequently it behoves us to speak in 
pul:)lic almost continually of the state of 
justification ; but more rarely in full and 
explicit terms concerning entii'e sanc- 
tification." Q. " What then, is the point 
wherein w'e divide ?" A. " It is this : 
Whether we sliould expect to be saved 
from all sin before the article of death." 
Q. " Is there any clear Scripture pro- 
mise of this, that God will save us from 
all sin?" A. "There is, Ps. cxxx. 8 : 
' He shall redeem Israel from all his 
iniquities.' This is more largely ex- 
pressed in Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 29. 2 Cor. 
vii. 1. Dent. xxx. 6. 1 John iii. 8. Eph. v. 
25, 27. John xvii. 20, 33. 1 John iv, 17." 

Thus I have endeavoured to give a 
view of the tenets of the Wesleyan 
Methodists ; and this I have chosen to 
do in their own Avords, in order to pre- 
vent misrepresentation. 

As to the doctrines of the Calvinistic 
Methodists, they need not be inserted 
here, as the reader will find the sub- 
stance of them under the article Cal- 

VINISTS. 

III. Methodists, government and dis- 
ci/iline of. A considerable number both 
of the Calvinist and Arminian Metho- 
dists approve of the discipline of the 
church of England, while many, it is 
said, are dissenters in principle. Mr. 
Wesley and Mr. Whitfield were both 
brought up in, and paid peculiar respect 
to that church. They did not, however, 
as it is well known, confine themselves 
to her laws in all respects as it related 
to discipline. 

Mr. Wesley having formed nurne- 
rous societies in different parts, he, with 
his brother Charles, drew up certain 
rules, by which they were, and it seem.s 
in many respects still are governed. 
They state the nature and design of a 
Methodist society in the following words : 

" Such a society is no other than a 
" company of men having the form and 
" seeking the power of godliness ; uni- 
" ted, in order to pray together, to re- 
" ceive the word of exhortation, and to

" watch over one another in love, that 
"they may help each other to work out 
" their salvation." 

" That it may the more easily be dis- 
cerned whether they are indeed work- 
ing out their own salvation, each society 
is divided into smaller companies, call- 
ed classes, according to their respective 
places of abode. There are about 
twelve persons (sometimes fifteen, 
twenty, or even more) in each class ; 
one of whom is styled the leader. It is 
his business, 1. To see each person in 
his class once a week, at least, in order 
to enquire how tlieir souls prosper ; to 
advise, repiove, comfort, oj" exhort, as 
occasion may require ; to receive what 
they are willing to give to the poor, or 
toward the Gospel. — 2. To meet the 
minister and the stewards of the society 
once a week, in order to inform the mi- 
nister of any that are sick, or of any 
that walk disorderly, and will not be re- 
proved ; to pay to the stewards what 
they have received of their several 
classes in the week preceding ; and to 
show their account ot wliat each person 
has contributed. 

"There is only one condition pre- 
viously required of those who desire 
admission into these, societies, namely, 
A desire to flee from the nvrath to come; 
to be saved from their sins : but where- 
ever this is really fixed in the soul, it 
will be shown by its fruits. It is, there- 
fore, expected of all who continue there- 
in, that they should continue to evidence 
their desire of salvation, 

" First, by doing no harm ; bv avoid- 
ing evil in every kind; especially that 
which is most generally practised, such 
as the taking the name of God in vain ; 
the profaning the day of the Loi'd, either 
by doing ordinary work thereon, or bv 
buying or selling; drunkenness ; buying 
or selling sftirituoiis liquors, or drinking 
them, unless in cases of extreme i^eces- 
sity ; fighting, quaiTelling, brawling ; 
brother ^o?';?,§- to law with "brother ; re-' 
tux-ning evil for evil, or railing for railing ; 
the using many ivords in buying or sell- 
ing ; the buying or selling uncustomed 
goods; the giving or taling things on 
nsjiry, i. e. unlawful interest. 

" Uncharitable, or unprojitable con- 
versation ; particularly speaking evil of 
magistrates, or of ministers. 

"Doing to others as we would not 
they should do unto us. 

" Doing what we know is not for the 
gloiy of God ; as the putting on gold or 
costly apparel: the taking such diver- 
sions as cannot be used in the name of 
the Lord Jesus. 

" The singing those songs, or reading 



those books, which do not tend to the 
knowledge or love of God ; softness and 
needless self-indulgence ; laying up trea- 
sure upon earth ; borrowing without a 
probability of paying; or taking up 
goods without a probability of paying 
for them. 

" It is expected of all who continue 
in these societies that they should con- 
tinue to evidence their desire of sal- 
vation, 

" Secondly, By doing good ; by being 
in every kind merciful after their power, 
as they have opportunity ; doing good 
of every possible sort, and as far as pos- 
sible to all men ; to their bodies, of the 
ability which God giveth ; by giving 
food to the hungi'y, by clothing the na- 
ked, by visiting or helping them that 
are sick, or in pi-ison ; to their souls, by 
instructing, reproving, or exhorting all 
I we have any intercourse with ; tram- 
j pfing under foot that enthusiastic doc- 
trine of devils, that, ' We are not to do 
good, unless our hearts be free to it' 

" By doing good, especially to them 
that are of the household of faith, or 
groaning so to be ; employing them pre- 
ferably to others ; buying one of ano- 
ther; helping each other in business; 
and so much the more, because the 
world will love its own, and them only; 
by all possible diligence and frugality, 
that the gospel be not blamed ; by lim- 
ning with patience the race set before 
them, denying themselves, and taking 
up their cross daily; submitting to bear 
the reproach of Christ ; to be as the 
filth and offscouring of the world, and 
looking that men should say all matiner 
of evil of them falsely for the Lord's 
sake. 

" It is expected of all who desire to 
continue in these societies, that they 
should continue to evidence their desire 
of salvation, 

" Thirdly, By attending on all the or- 
dinances of God : such are, — The pub- 
lic worship of God ; the ministry of the 
word, either read or expounded ; the 
supper of the Lord ; family and private 
praver ; searching the Scriptures ; and 
fasting and abstinence. 

" These are the general rules of our 
societies, all which we are taught of 
God to observe, even in his written 
word ; the only rule, and the sufficient 
rule, both of our fiith and practice ; and 
all these we know his Spirit writes on 
every truly awakened heart. If there 
be any among us who observe them not, 
who habitually break any of them, let it 
be made known unto them who watch 
over that soul, as they who must give 
an account. We will admonish him of

the error of his ways; we will bear 
with him for a season ; but then, if he 
repent not, he hath no more place 
among us: we have delivered our own 
souls. 

nr -I iT^o John Wesley. 

May 1, 1743. ^^^^^^^^ Wesletj." 

In Mr. Wesley's connexion, they have 
circuits and conferences, which we find 
were thus formed : — ^When the preach- 
ers at first went out to exhort and 
preach, it was by Mr. Wesley's per- 
mission and direction ; some ia-qp one 
pai't of the kingdom, and some from 
another ; and though frequently stran- 
gers to each other, and those to whom 
they were sent, yet on his credit and 
sanction alone they were received and 
provided for as friends by the societies 
wherever they came. But, having little 
or no communication or intercourse 
with one another, nor an)' subordination 
among themselves, they must have been 
under the necessity of recurring to Mr. 
Wesley for directions how and where 
they were to labour. To remedy this in- 
convenience, he conceived the design of 
calling them together to an annual con- 
ference : by this means he brought them 
into closer union with each other, and 
made them sensible of the utility of act- 
ing in concert and harmony. He soon 
found it necessary, also to bring their 
itinerancy under certain regulations, and 
reduce it to some fixed order, both to 
prevent confusion, and for his own ease : 
he therefore took, fifteen or twenty so- 
cieties, more or less, which lay round 
some principal society in those parts, 
and which were so situated, that the 
greatest distance from one to the other 
was not much more than twenty miles, 
and united them into what was called a 
circuit. At the yearly conference he ap- 
pointed two, three, or four preachers, to 
one of these circuits, according to its 
extent, which at first was often very 
considerable, sometimes taking in a pai't 
of thi-ee or four counties. Here, and 
here onlv, were they to labour for one 
year, that is until the next conference. 
One of the preachers on every circuit 
was called the assistant, because he as- 
sisted Mr. Wesley in superintending the 
societies and other preachers ; he took 
charge of the societies within the limits 
assigned him ; he enforced the rules 
every where, and directed the labours 
of the preachers associated with him. 
Having received a list of the societies 
forming his circuit, he took his own sta- 
tion in it, gave to the other preachers 
a plan of it, and pointed out the day 
when each should be at the place fixed 
for him, to begin a progressive motion 



round it, in such order as the plan di- 
rected. They now followed one another 
through all the societies belonging to 
that circuit, at stated distances of time, 
all being governed by the same rules, 
and undergoing the same labour. By 
this plan, every preacher's daily work 
was appointed beforehand ; each knew, 
every day, where the others were, and 
each society when to expect the preach- 
er, and how long he would stay with 
them. — It may be observed, however, 
that Mr. Wesley's design in calling the 
preachers together annually, was not 
merely for the regulation of the circuits, 
but also for the review of their doctrines 
and discipline, and for the examination 
of their moral conduct ; that those who 
were to administer with him in holy 
things might be thoroughly furnished 
for every good nvork. 

The first conference was held in June 
1744, at which Mr. Wesley met his 
brother, two or three other clergymen, 
and a few of the preachers whom he 
liad appointed to come from various 
parts, to confer with them on the affairs 
of tlie societies. 

" Monday, June 25," obsein-es Mr. 
Wesley, "and the five following days, 
we spent in conference with our preach- 
ers, seriously considering by what means 
we might the most effectually save our 
own souls, and them that heard us ; and 
the result of our consultations we set 
down to be the rule of our future prac- 
tice." 

Since that time a conference has been 
held annually, Mr. Wesley himself 
having presided at forty-seven. The 
subjects of their deliberations were pro- 
posed in the form of questions, which 
were amply discussed ; and the ques- 
tions, with the answers agreed upon, 
were afterwards printed under the title 
of " Minutes of several Conversations 
between the Rev. Mr. Wesley and 
others," commonly called Minutes of 
Conference. 

As to their preachers, the following 
extract from the above-mentioned Mi- 
nutes of Conference will show us in what 
manner they are chosen and designated : 
Q. " How shall we try those who think 
they are moved by the Holy Ghost to 
preach ?" A. " Inquire 1. Do' they know 
God as a pardoning God ? Have they 
the love of God abiding in them ? Do 
they desire and seek nothing but God.^ 
And are they holy in all manner of 
conversation? — 2. 'Have they gifts., as 
well as grace, for the work ? Have 
they, in some tolerable degree, a clear, 
sound understanding ? Have they a right 
judgment in the things of God ? Have

ihey a just conception of salvation by 
faith ? And has God given them any de- 
gree of utterance ? Do they speak justly, 
readily, clearly ? — 3. Have they fruit? 
Are any tnily convinced of sin, and con- 
verted to God, by their preaching ? 

" As long as these three marks con- 
cur in any one, we believe he is called 
of God to preach. These we receive 
as sufficient proof that he is moved 
(hereto by the Holy Ghost. 

Q. "What method may we use in 
receiving a new helper?" A. " A proper 
time for doing this is at a conference, 
after solemn fosting and prayer ; every 
person proposed is then to be present, 
and each of them may be asked, 

"Have you faith in Christ? Are you 
g^oi?ig- on to /ierfect/07} ? Do you expect 
to be perfected' in love in this life ? Are 
you groaning after it ? Are you resolved 
to devote yourself wholly to God and to 
his work ? Have vou considered the 
rules of a helfier ? Will you keep them 
for conscience' sake ? Are you deter- 
mined to eniplov all your time in the 
wcrk of God r W'ill you preach every 
morning, and evening? M'ill you dili- 
gently instruct the children in every 
place ? Will you visit from house to 
house ? Will you recommend fasting 
both by precept and example ? 

" We then may receive him as a pro- 
bationer, by giving him the Minutes of 
the Conference, inscribed thus: — 'To 
A. B. You think it your duty to call 
sinners to repentance. Make full proof 
hei'eof, and we shall rejoice to receive 
you as a fellow-labourer.' Let him then 
read and carefully weigh what is con- 
tained therein, that if lie has any doubt 
it may be removed." 

"To the above it maybe useful to 
add," says Mr. Benson, " a few remarks 
on the method pursued in the choice of 
the itinerant preachers, ?is many have 
formed the most erroneous ideas on the 
subject, imagining they are employed 
with hardly any prior preparation. 1. 
They are received as private members 
of the society on trial. — 2. After a quar- 
ter of a year, if they are found deserv- 
ing, they are admitted as proper mem- 
bers. — 3. When their grace and abilities 
are sufficiently manifest, they ai-e ap- 
pointed leaders of classes. — 4. If they 
then discover talents for more important 
services, they are employed to exhort 
occasionally in the smaller congrega- 
tions, when the preachers cannot attend. 
— 5. If approved in this line of dutv, 
they are allowed to preach. — 6. Out of 
these men who are called local preach- 
ers, vive selected iheitinerant /ireache?-s, 
who ave first proposed at a quartei-lv 



meeting of the stewards and local 
preachers of the circuit ; then at a 
meeting of the travelling preachers of 
the district ; and, lastly, in the confer- 
ence ; and, if accepted, are nominated 
for a circuit. — 7. 1 heir characters and 
conduct are examined annually in the 
conference ; and, if they continue faith- 
ful for four vears of trial, they are re- 
ceived into full connection. At these 
conferences, also, strict enquiry is made 
into the conduct and success of eveiy 
pieacjier, and those who are found defi.- 
cient in abilities are no longer employed 
as itinerants ; while those whose con- 
duct has not been agreeable to the Gos- 
pel are expelled, and thereby deprived 
of all the privileges even of private 
members of the society." 

IV. Methodists, 7ie%v connection of. 
Since Mr. Wesley's death, his people 
have been divided ; but this division, it 
seems, re.spects discipline more than 
sentiment. Mr. Wesley professed a 
strong attachment to the established 
church of England, and exhorted the 
societies under his care to attend her 
service, and receive the Lord's supper 
from the regular clergy. But in the lat- 
ter part of his time he thought proper 
to ordain some bishops and priests for 
America and Scotland ; but as one or 
two of the bishops have never been out 
of England since their appointment to 
the ofHce, it is probable that he intended 
a regular ordination should take place 
when the state of the connection might 
render it necessary. During his life, 
some of the societies petitioned to have 
preaching in their own chapels in church 
hours, and the Lord's supper admi- 
nistered by the travelling preachers. 
This request he generally refused, and, 
where it could be conveniently done, 
sent some of the clergymen who offi- 
ciated at the New Chapel in London to 
perform these solemn services. At the 
first conference after his death, which 
was held at Manchester, the preachers 
published a declaration, in which they 
said that they would " take up the Plan 
as Mr. Wesley had left it." This was 
by no means satisfactory to many of the 
preachers and people, Avho thought that 
religious liberty ought to be extended 
to all the societies which desired it. In 
order to favour this cause, so agreeable 
to the spirit of Christianity and the 
rights of Englishmen, several respecta- 
ble preachers came forward ; and by 
the writings which they circulated 
through the connection, paved the way 
for a plan of pacification; by which it 
was stipulated, that in every society 
where a threefold majority of class- 



MET 



369 



MET 



ieaders, stewards, and trustees desired 
it, the people should have preaching in 
church hours, and the sacraments of bap- 
tism and the Lord's supper administered 
to them. The spirit of inquiry being 
roused did not stop here ; for it ap- 
peared agreeable both to reason and 
the customs of the primitive church, 
that the people should have a voice in 
the temporal concerns of the societies, 
vote in the election of church officers, 
and give their suffrages in spiritual con- 
cerns. This subject produced a variety 
of arguments on both sides of the ques- 
tion: many of the preaclifrs and peo- 
ple thought that an annual delegation of 
the genei'al stewards of the circuits, to 
sit either in the conference or tlie dis- 
trict meetings, in order to assist in the 
disbursement of the yearly collection, 
the Kingswood School collection, and 
the preachers' fimd, and in making 
new or revising old laws, would be a 
bond of union between the conference 
and connection at large, and do away 
the very idea of arbitrary power among 
the travelling preachel's. In oi'der to 
facilitate this good work, many societies, 
in various parts of the kingdom, sent 
delegates to the conference held at 
Leeds in 1797 ; they were instructed to 
request, that the people might have a 
voice in the formation of their own lanvs, 
the choice of their own officers, ami the 
distribution of their own firoperty. The 
preachers proceeded to discuss two mo- 
tions : Shall delegates from the societies 
be admitted into the conference .-' Shall 
circuit stewards be admitted into the 
district meetings ? Both motions were 
negatived, and consequently all hopes of 
accommodation between the parties 
were given up. Sevei'al friends of re- 
ligious libertv proposed a plan for a new 
itinerancy. In order that it might be 
carried into immediate effect, they form- 
ed themselves into a regular meeting, 
in Ebenezer Chapel, Mr. William 
Thom being chosen president, and Mr. 
Alexander Kilham, secretaiy. The 
meeting proceeded to arrange the plan 
for supplying the circuits of the new 
connection with preachers ; and desired 
the president and secretary to draw up 
the rules of church government, in or- 
der that they might be circulated 
through the societies for their appro- 
bation. Accordingly, a form of church 
government, suited to an itinerant mi- 
nistry, was printed by these two breth- 
ren, under the title of "Outlines of a 
Constitution proposed for the Examina- 
tion, Amendment, and Acceptance of 
the Members of the Methodist new Iti- 
nerancy." The plan was examined by 



select committees in the different cir- 
cuits of the connection, and, with few 
altei-ations, was accepted by the con- 
ference of . preachers and delegates. 
The preachers and people are incor- 

E orated in all meetings for business, not 
y temporary concession, but by the es- 
sential principles of their constitution; 
for the private members choose the 
class-leaders ; the leaders' meeting no- 
minates the stewards; and the society 
confirms or rejects the nomination. 
The quarterly meetings are composed 
of the general stewards and representa- 
tives chosen by the different societies of 
the circuits, and the fourth quarterly 
meeting of the year appoints the preach- 
er and delegate of eveiy circuit that 
shall attend the general conference. 
For a farther account of their princi- 
ples and discipline, we must refer the 
reader to a pamphlet entitled " Gene- 
ral Rules of the United Societies of Me- 
thodists m the new Connection." 

The Calvinistic Methodists are not 
incoi-porated into a body as the Armi- 
nians are, but are chiefly under the di- 
rection or mfluence of their ministers or 
patrons. 

It is necessary to observe here, that 
there are many congregations in Lon- 
don, and elsewhere, who, although they 
are called Methodists, vet are neither 
in Mr. Wesley's, Mr. Whitfield's, nor 
the new connection. Some of these are 
supplied by a variety of ministers ; and 
others, bordering more upon the con- 
gregational plan, have a resident minis- 
ter. The clergy of the church of Eng- 
land who strenuously preach up her doc- 
trines and articles, are called Metho- 
dists. A distinct connection upon Mr. 
Whitfield's plan, was formed and pa- 
tronized by tlie late Lady Huntingdon, 
and which still subsists. The teiin 
Metliodist, also, is applied by way of 
reproach to almost every one who 
manifests more than common concern 
for the interests of religion, and the 
spiritual good of mankind. 

V. Alethodists, numbers, and success 
of. Notwithstanding the general con- 
tempt that has been thrown upon them, 
and the opposition they have met with, 
vet their numbers are very considerable. 
Erom the minutes of the conference 
of the Wesleyan Methodists held in 
London, July 30, 1810, it appears that 
the number of persons in their societies 
is as follows. In Great Britain, 137,997; 
Gibraltar 50 ; in the \\''est Indies, No- 
va Scotia, and Newfoundland, 13,580. 
The Methodists in America are not in 
immediate connection with the Wes- 
leyans here. Their church is Episcopal,

,i!k1 ar.conliii'!; to their account in lo09, 
contains 163,033 persons. Among the 
Calvinistic Methodists, there are also 
a considerable number of preachers, 
whose congregations and societies are 
very extensive: some of their chapels in 
I,ohdon are tlie largest and best attend- 
ed in the world: it "is almost incredible 
to see the numbers of people who flock 
to these places. As to their success m 
doing good, it is evident, that though 
many ignorant enthusiasts have been 
found among them, yet no people have 
done more to moralize mankind than 
they : nor have they rested there ; they 
have not only contributed to render 
thousands better members of society, 
but been the instruments of promoting 
their spiritual and eternal interests. 
Their simplicity of language, fervour of 
address, patience in opposition, unwea- 
riedness m labour, piety of conduct, and 
dependence oa Almighty God, are cer- 
tainly Avorthy of the greatest praise, 
and call for -the imitation of many who 
unjustly condemn them. See History

MILITANT, from militans, fight- 
ing ; a term applied to the church on 
earth, as engaged in a warfare with the 
world, sin, and the devil ; in distinc- 
tion from the church iriumfihant in 
heaven. 

MILLENARIANS, or Shilianists, 
a name given to those who believe that 
the saints will reign on earth with 
Christ a thousand years. See next ar- 
ticle. 

MILLli.NNIUM,« a thousand years;" 
generally emplo)-ed to denote the thou- 
sand years, during which, according to 
an ancient tradition in the church, 
grounded on some doubtful texts in the 
Apocalypse and other scriptures, our 
blessed Saviour shall reign with the 
faithful upon earth after the first resur- 
rection, before the final completion of 
beatitude. 

Though there have been no age of 
the church in which the millennium was 
not admitted by individual divines of the 
first eminence, it is yet evident, fix)m 
the writings of Eusebius, Irenacus, Ori- 
geji, and others, among the ancients, as 



well as from the histories of Dupm, 
Mosheim, and all the moderns, that it 
was never adopted by the whole church, 
or made an article of the established 
creed in any nation. 

Al)out the middle of the fourth cen- 
tury the Millenarians held the following 
tenets : • . 

1st, That the city of Jerusalem should 
be rebuilt, and that the land of Judea 
should be tlie habitation of those who 
were to reign on the earth a thousand 
years. 

2dly, That the first resuiTection was 
not to be confined to the mai'tyrs, but 
that, after the fall of Antichrist, all the 
just were to rise, and all that were on 
the earth were to continue for that space 
of time. 

3dly, That Christ shall then come 
down from heaven, and be seen on earth, 
and reign there with his servants. 

4thly, That the saints, during this pe- 
riod, shall enjoy all the delights of a ter- 
j'estrial jjaradise. 

These opinions were founded upon 
several passages in Scripture, which the 
Millenarians, among the fathers, under- 
stood in no other than a literal sense ; 
but which the moderns, who hold that 
opinion, consider as partly literal and 
partly metaphoi'ical. Of these passages, 
that upon which the greatest stress has 
been laid we believe to be the follow- 
ing : — " And I saw an angel come 
down from heaven, having the key of 
the bottomless pit, and a great chain in 
his hand. And he laid liold on the dra- 
gon, that old serpent, which is the devil 
and Satan, and bound him a thousand 
years, and cast him into the bottomless 

Eit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon 
im, that he should deceive the nations 
no more, till the thousand years should 
be fulfilled ; and, after that, he must be 
loosed a little season. And I saw thrones, 
and they sat upon them, and judgment 
was given unto them ; and I saw the 
souls of them that were beheaded for 
the witness of Jesus and for the word of 
God, and which had not worshipped the 
beast, neither his image, neither had 
received his mark upon their foreheads, 
nor in their hands ; and they lived and 
reigned with Christ a thousand years. 
But the i-est of the dead lived not again 
till the thousand years were finished. 
This is the first resurrection." Rev. xx. 
1 — 6. This passage all the ancient Mil- 
lenarians took in a sense grossly literal, 
and taught, that, during the Millen- 
nium, the saints on earth were to enjoy 
every bodily delight. The modems, on 
the other hand, consider the power and 
pleasures of this kingdom as Avholly spi-

ritual ; and they represent them as not 
to commence till after the conflagration 
of the present earth. But that this last 
supposition is a mistake, the very next 
verse but on^ assures us ; for we are 
there told, that, "when the thousand 
years are exph'ed, Satan shall be loosed 
out of his prison, and shall go out to de- 
ceive the nations which are in the four 
quarters of the earth ;" and we have no 
reason to believe that lie will have such 
power or such liberty in " the new hea- 
vens and the new earth, wherein dwell- 
eth righteousness." We mav obser\e, 
however, tlie following things respect- 
ing it : 1. That the Scriptures afford us 
ground to believe that the church will 
arrive to a state of prospei-ity which it 
never has yet enjoved, Rev. xx. 4, 7. 
Psal. Ixxii. il. Is. ii'. 2, 4. xi. 9. xlix. 23. 
Ix. Dan. vii. 27. — 2. That this will con- 
tinue at least a thousand years, or a con- 
siderable space of time, in which the 
"work of salvation may be fiiUy accom- 
plished in the utmost extent and giory 
of it. In this time, in which the world 
■will soon be filled with real Christians, 
and continue full bj^ constant propaga- 
tion to supply the place of those who 
leave the world, there will be many 
thousands born and li\ e on the eartli, 
to each one that has been born and lived 
in the preceding six thousand years; 
so that, if tl\ey who shall be born in that 
thousand years shall be all, or most of 
them saved (as they will be,) there will, 
on the whole, be many thousands of 
mankind saved to one that shall be lost. 
— 3. This will be a state of great hap- 
piness and glory. Some think that 
Christ will reign ])ersonally on earth, 
and that there will be a literal resur- 
rection of the saints. Rev. xx. 4, 7 ; but 
I rather suppose that the reign of Christ 
and resurrection of saints alluded to in 
that passage, is only figurative ; and that 
nothmg more is meant than that, before 
the general judgment, the Jews shall be 
converted, genuine Christianity be dif- 
fused through all nations, and that Christ 
!-hall reign, by his spiritual presence, in 
a gloi'ious manner. It will, however, 
be a time of eminent holiness, clear 
light and knowdedge, lo^'e, peace, and 
friendship, agreement in doctrine and 
worship. Human life, perhaps, will 
rarely be endangered b}' the jjoisons of 
the mineral, vegetable, and animal king- 
doms. Beasts of prey, perhaps will be 
extirpated, or tamed by the power of 
man. The inhabitants of every place 
will rest secure fi-oni fear of robbery and 
murder. War shall be entirely ended. 
Capital crimes and punishments be 
heard of no more. Govermnents placed 



on fair, just, and humane foundations. 
The torch of civil discord will be ex- 
tinguished. Perhaps Pagans, Turks, 
Deists, and Jews, will be as few in num- 
ber as Christians are now. Kings, no- 
bles, magistrates, and nilers in churches 
shall act with principle, and be forward 
to promote the best interests of men : 
tyranny, oppi'ession, persecution, bi- 
gotry, and cmelty, shall cease. Busi- 
ness will be attended to without con- 
tention, dishonesty, and co\etousness. 
Trades and manufactories will be car- 
ried on with a design to promote the 
general good of mankind, and not with 
selfish interests, as now. Merchandise 
between distant countries will be con- 
ducted without fear of an enemy ; and 
works of ornament and beauty, perhaps, 
shall not be wanting in those days. 
Learning, which has always flourished 
in proportion as religion has spread, 
shall then greatly increase, and be em- 
ployed for the best of purposes. As- 
tronomy, geography, natural history, 
metaphysics, and all the useful sciences, 
will be better understood, and conse- 
crated to the service of God ; and I 
cannot help thinking that by the im- 
provements which ha\'e been made, and 
are making, in ship-building, navigation, 
electricity, medicine, &amp;c. that " the 
tempest will lose half its force, the 
lightning lose half its terrors," and the 
human frame not near so much exposed 
to danger. Above all, the Bilile will be 
more highly appreciated, its harmony 
perceived, its superiority owned, and 
its energy felt by millions of human be- 
ings. In fact, the earth shall l)e filled 
with the knowledge of the Lord as the 
waters cover the sea. — 4. The time 
when the Millennium will commence 
cannot be fully ascertained ; but the 
common idea is, that it will be in the 
seven thousandth year of the world. It 
will, most probably, come on by de- 
grees, and be in a manner introduced 
years before that time. And who 
knows but the present convulsions 
among different nations ; the overthrow 
ij which popery has had in places where 
jj it has been so dominant for hundreds of 
|! years ; the fulfilment of pro]ihecy re- 
|i specting infidels, and the falling away

MIND, a thinking, intelligent being; 
otherwise called spirit, or soul. See 
Soul. Dr. Watts has given us some 
admirable thoughts as to the imfirove- 
ment of the mind. " There are Jive 
eminent means or methods''\\&amp; observes, 
"whereby the mind is improved in the 
knowledge of things ; and these are, ob- 
servation, reading, instruction by lec- 
tures, conversation, and meditation; 
which last, in a most peculiar manner, 
is called study. See Watts on the Mind, 
a book which no student should be 
without. 

MINIMS, a religious order in the 
r.hurch of Rome, founded by St. Francis 
de Paula, towards the end of the fif- 
teenth century. Their habit is a coarse 
black woollen stuff, with a woollen girdle 
of the same colour, tied in five knots. 
They ai'e not permitted to miit their 
habit and girdle night nor day. Formerly 
they went barefooted, but are now al- 
lowed the use of shoes. 

MINISTER, a name applied to those 
who are pastors of a congregation, or 
preachers of God's word. They are 
also called divines, and may be distin- 
s^nished into /iole?nic, or those who pos- 
sess controversial talents ; casuistic, or 
those who resolve cases of conscience ; 
experimental, those who address them- 
selves to the feelings, cases, and circum- 
stances of their hearers ; and, lastly, 
practical, those who insist upon the per- 
fonnance of all those duties which the 
word of God enjoins. An able minister 
^vill have something of all these united 
in him, though he may not excel in all ; 
avid it becomes every one who is a can- 
didate for the ministry to get a clear 
idea of each, that he may not be defi- 
■tient hi the discharge of that work | 



which is the most impoi1;ant that ean 
be sustained by mortal beings. Many vo- 
lumes have been written on this subject, 
but Ave must be content in this place to 
offer only a few remarks relative to it. 
In the first place, then, it must be ob- 
served, that ministers of* the Gospel 
ought to be sound as to their principles. 
They must be men whose hearts are 
renovated by divine gi'ace, and whose 
sentiments are derived from the sacred 
oracles of divine truth. A minister 
without principles will never do any 
good ; and he who professes to believe 
in a system, should see to it that it ac- 
cords with the woi'd of God. His mind 
should clearly perceive the beauty, har- 
mony, and utility of the doctrines, while 
his heart should be deeply impressed 
with a sense of their value and impor- 
tance. — 2. They should be mild ana af- 
fable as to their dispositions and deport- 
menti — A haughty imperious spirit is a 
disgi'ace to the ministerial character, 
and generally brings contempt. They 
should learn to bear injuries with pa- 
tience, and be ready to do good to e\'ery 
one ; be courteous to all without cring- 
ing to any ; be affable without levity, 
and humble without pusillanimity ; con- 
ciliating the affections without violating 
the truth ; connecting a suavity of man- 
ners with a dignity of character; 
obliging without flattery ; and throwing 
off all reserve without running into the 
opposite extreme of volubility and tri- 
fling. — 3. They should be superior as to 
their knowledge and talents. Though 
many have been useful without what is 
called learning, yet none have been so 
without some portion of knowledge and 
wisdom. Nor has God Almighty ever 
sanctified ignorance, or consecrated it 
to his service ; since it is the effect of 
the fall, and the consequence of our de- 
parture from the Fountain of intelli- 
gence. Ministers, therefore, especially, 
should endeavour to break these shac- 
kles, get their minds enlarged, and 
stored with all useful knowledge. The 
Bible should be well studied, and that, 
if possible, in the original language. 
The scheme of salvation by Jesus Christ 
should be well understood, with all the 
various topics connected with it Nor 
will some knowledge of history, natural 
philosophy, logic, mathematics, and 
rhetoric, be useless. A clear judgment, 
also, with a retentive memory, inven- 
tive faculty, and a facility of commimi- 
cation, should be obtained. — 4. They 
should- be diligent as to their studies. 
Their time especially should be im- 
proved, and not lost by too much sleep, 
formal visits, indolence, reading useless 



MIN

books, studying useless subjects. Every 
dav should have its work, and every 
subject its due attention. Some advise 
a chapter in the Hebrew Bible, and ano- 
ther in the Greek Testament, to be 
read every day. A well-chosen system 
of divinity should be accurately studied. 
The best definitions should be obtained, 
and a constant regard paid to all those 
studies which savour of religion, and 
have some tendency to public work. — 5. 
Ministers should be extensive as to 
their benevolence and candour. A con- 
tracted bigoted spirit ill becomes those 
who preach a Gospel which breathes tlie 
purest benevolence to mankind. This 
spirit has done more harm among all 
parties than many imagine ; and is, 
m my opinion, one of the most powerful 
engines the devil makes use of to oppose 
the best interests of mankind ; ancl it is 
really shocking to obsei-Ae how sects and 
parties have all, in their turns, anathe- 
matized each other. Now, while minis- 
ters ought to contend earnestly for the 
faith once delivered to the saints, tliey 
must I'emember that men always will 
think different from each other; that 
prejudice of education has great influ- 
ence ; that difference of opinion as to 
non-essential things is not of such im- 

Eortance as to be a ground of dislike. 
,et the ministers of Christ, then, pity 
the weak, forgive the ignorant, bear 
with the sincere though mistaken zea- 
lot, and love all who love the Lord Je- 
sus Christ. — 6. ATinisters should be 
zealous and faithful in their public 
ivork. The sick must be visited ; chil- 
dren must be catechised ; the ordinances 
administered ; and the word of God 
preached. These things must be taken 
up, not as a matter of duty only, but of 
pleasure, and executed with faithfulness ; 
and, as they are of the utmost impor- 
tance, ministers should attend to them 
with all that sincerity, earnestness, 
and zeal which that importance de- 
mands. An idle, frigid, indifferent mi- 
nister is a pest to society, a disgrace to 
his profession, an injury to the church, 
and offensive to God himself. — 7. Lastly, 
ministers should be uniform as to their 
conduct. No brightness of talent, no su- 
periority of intellect, no extent of know- 
ledge, will ever be a substitute for this. 
They should not only possess a luminous 
mind, but set a good example. This 
will procure dignity to themselves, give 
energy to what they say, and prove a 
blessing to the circle in which they 
move. In fine, they should be men of 
prudence and prayer, light and love, 
aeal and knowledge, courage and hu- 
mjlitv, humanity and religion. See

MINISTRY, GOSPEL, an ordinance 
appointed for the puipose of instructing 
men in the principles and knowledge &lt;^ 
the Gospel, Eph. iv. 8, IL Rom. x. 15. 
Heb. V. 4. Thdt the Gospel ministry^ 
is of divine origin, and intended to be 
kept up in the church, will evidently 
appeal', if we consider the promises, 
that in the last and best times of 
the New Testament dispensation there 
would be an instituted and regular mi- 
nistry in her, Eph. iv. 8, 11. Tit. i. 5. 
1 Pet. V. 1 Tim. i. ; also from the names 
of office peculiar to some members in 
the chui-ch, and not common to all, Eph. 
iv. 8, 11 ; from the duties which are re- 
presented as reciprocally binding on mi- 
nisters and people, Heb. xiii. 7. 17. 1 
Pet. V. 2, 3, 4 ; from the promises of as- 
sistance which were given to the first 
ministers of the new dispensation, Matt. 
xxviii. 20 ; and from the importance of 
a Gospel Ministry, Avhich is represented 
in the Scripture as a very great blessing 
to them who enjoy it, and the removal 
of it as one of the greatest calamities 
which can befall any people. Rev. ii. and 
iii. See books under last article. 

MINISTERIAL CALL, a term used 
to denote that right or authority which 
a person receives to preach the Gospel. 
This call is considered as twofold, di- 
vine and ecclesiastical. The following 
things seem essential to a divine call : 
1. A holy, blameless life. — 2. An ardent 
and constant inclination and zeal to do 
good. — 3. Abilities suited to the work: 
such as knowledge, aptness to teach, 
courage, &amp;c. — 4. An opportunity af 
forded in Providence to be useful. An 
ecclesiastical call consists in the election 
which is made of any person to be a 
pastor. But hei-e the Episcopalian and 
the Dissenter differ; the former be- 
lieving that the choice and call of a mi- 
nister rest with the superior clergy, or 
those who ha\'e the gift of an ecclesias- 
tical benefice ; the latter supposes that 
it should rest on the suffrage of the peo- 
ple to whom he is to minister. The

Churchman reasons thus: "Though 
the people may be competent judges 
of the abilities of their tradesmen, they 
cannot be allowed to have an equal 
discernment in matters of science and 
erudition. Daily experience may con- 
vince us how injudiciously preferment 
would be distributed by popular elec- 
tions. The modesty of genius would 
stand little chance of being distinguish- 
ed by an ignorant multitude. The most 
illiterate, the most impudent, those who 
could most dexterously play the hypo- 
crite, who could best adapt their preach- 
ing to the fanaticism of the vulgar, 
■would be the only successful candidates 
for public favour. Thus moderation 
and literature would soon be banished, 
and a scene of corruption, confusion, and 
madness, would prevail." But specious 
as these arguments seem, they have 
but little force on the mind of the Con- 
gregationalist, who thus reasons : " The 
church being a \'oluntary society, none 
imposed upon her members by men 
can be related to them as their pastor 
without their own consent. None can 
so well judge what gifts are best suit- 
ed to their s])iritual eoification as Chris- 
tians themselves. The Scriptures al- 
low the election of pastors in ordinary 
cases to adult Chi'istians, and to none 
else. Acts i. 15, 26. Acts vi. 1, 6. Acts 
xiv. 23. Christ requires his people to 
try the spirits, which supposeth their 
ability to do so, and their power to 
choose such only as they find most pro- 
per to edify their souls, and to refuse 
others, 1 John iv. 1. The introduction of 
ministers into their office by patronage, 
of whatever form, hath its origin from 
popery, tends to establish a tyranny 
over men's conscience, which and whom 
Christ hath made free, and to fill pul- 
pits with wicked and indolent clergy- 
men. Whoever will attentively examine 
the history of the primitive times, will 
iiud that all ecclesiastical officers for 
the first three hundred years were 
elected by the people." We must re- 
fer the reader for more on this subject 
to the articles Church, Episcopacy, 
and Independents. 

MIRACLE, in its original sense, is a 
woi'd of the same import with tvonder; 
but, in its usual and more appropriate 
signification, it denotes "an effect con- 
trary to the established constitution and 
course of things, or a sensible deviation 
from the known laws of nature." 

"That the visible world," says Dr. 
Gleig, " is governed by stated general 
rules, or that there is an order of causes 
and effects established in every part of 
the system of nature which falls under 



our observation, is a fact which cannot 
be controverted. If the Supi-eme Being, 
as some have supposed, be the only real 
agent in the universe, we have the 
evidence of experience, that in the par- 
ticular system to which we belong he 
acts by stated rules. If he employs in- 
ferior agents to conduct the various 
motions from which the phenomena re- 
sult, we have the same evidence that 
he has subjected those agents to certain 
fixed laws, commonly called the laws of 
nature. On either hypothesis, effects 
which are produced by the regular 
operation of these laws, or which are 
conformable to the established course of 
events, are properly called natural; 
and every contradiction to this consti- 
tution of the natural system, and the 
correspondent course of events in it, is 
called a miracle. 

" If this definition of a miracle be just, 
no event can be deemed miraculous 
merely because it is strange, or even 
to us unaccountable : since it may be 
nothing more than a regular effect of 
some unknown law of nature. In this 
country earthquakes are rare ; and for 
monstrous births, perhaps, no particu- 
lar and satisfactory account can be 
given : yet an earthquake is as regular 
an' effect of the established laws of na- 
ture as any of those with which we are 
most intimately acquainted : and, under 
circumstances in which there would 
always be the same kind of production, 
the monster is nature's genuine issue. 
It is therefore necessary, before we can 
pronounce any effect to be a true mira- 
cle, that the circumstances under which 
it is produced be known, and that the 
common course of nature be in some 
degree understood ; for in all those 
cases in which we are totally ignorant 
of nature, it is impossible to determine 
what is, or what is not, a deviation from 
its course. Miracles, therefore, are not, 
as somohave representedthem, appeals 
to our ignorance. They suppose some an- 
tecedent knowledge of the course of na- 
ture, without which no proper judgment 
can be formed concerning them ; though 
with it their reality may be so apparent 
as to prevent all possibility of a dispute. 

" Thus, were a physician to cure a 
blind man of a cataract, by anointing 
his eyes with a chemical preparation 
which we had never before seen, and 
to the nature and effects of which we 
are aljsolute strangers, the cure would 
undwibtedly be ivotiderful ; but we 
could not pronounce it miraculous, be- 
cause, for any thing known to us, it 
might be the naturaleffect of the opera- 
tion of the unguent on the eye. But were 



MIR

he to recover his patient merely by 
commanding him to see, or by anoint- 
ing liis eyes with spittle, we should with 
the utmost confidence pronounce the 
cure to be a miracle ; because we know 
perfectly that neither the human voice 
nor human spittle have, by the establish- 
ed constitution of things, any such pow- 
er over the diseases of the eye. 

" If miracles be effects contrary to 
the established constitution of things, 
we are certain that they will never be 
performed on trivial occasions. The 
constitution of things was established 
by the Creator and Go\ernor of the 
universe, and is undoubtedly the off- 
spring of infinite wisdom, pursuing a 
plan for the best of purposes. From 
this plan no deviation can be made but 
by God himself, or by some powerful 
being acting with his permission. The 
plans devised l^y wisdom are steady in 
proportion to their perfection, and the 
plans of infinite wisdom must be abso- 
lutely perfect. From this consideration, 
some men have ventured to conclude 
that no miracle was ever wrought, or 
tan rationally be expected; but maturer 
reflection must. soon satisfy us that all 
such conclusions are hasty. 

" Man is unquestionably the principal 
creature in this world, and apparently 
the only one in it vyflio is capable of being 
made acquainted with the relation in 
which he stands to his Creator. We 
cannot, therefore, doubt, but that such 
of the laws of nature as extend not their 
operation beyond the limits of this earth 
were established chiefly, if not solely, 
for the good of mankind ; and if, in any 
particular circumstances, that good can 
be more effectually promoted by an oc- 
casional deviation from those laws, such 
a deviation may be reasonably expected. 

" We know from history, that almost 
all mankind were once sunk intto the 
grossest ignorance of the most impor- 
tant truths ; that they knew not the 
Being by whom they were created and 
supported ; that they paid divine adora- 
tion to stocks, stones, and the vilest 
reptiles ; and that they were slaves to 
the most impious, cruel, and degrading 
superstitions. 

" From this depraved state it was 
surely not unworthy of the Divine 
Being to rescue his helpless creatures, 
to enlighten their understandings that 
they might perceive what is right, and 
to present to them motives of s'ufiicieiit 
force to engage them in the practice of 
it. But the understandings of ignorant 
barbarians cannot be enlightened by 
arguments ; because of the force of 
such arguments as regard mc»:al science 



they are not qualified to judge. Tlie 
phi!osoj)hers of Athens and Rome in- 
culcated, indeed, many excellent moral 
precepts, and they sometimes ventured 
to expose the absui'dities of the reign- 
ing superstitions ; but their lectures had 
no inlluence upon the multitude ; and 
they had themselves imbibed such erro- 
neous notions respecting the attributes 
of the Supreme Being, and the nature 
of tlie human sovd, and converted those 
notions into first principles, of which 
tliey would not permit an examination, 
that even am«ng tliem a thorough re- 
formation was not to be expected from 
the powers of reasoning. It is likewise 
to be observed, that there are many 
tiniths of the utmost importance to man- 
kind, which unassisted reason could 
never have d&gt; covered. Amongst these, 
we may confidently reckon the immor- 
tality of the soul, the terms upon which 
fiod will save sinners, and the manner 
in which that all perfect Being may be 
acceptably worshipped ; about all of 
which philosophers were in such un- 
certainty, that, according to Plato, 
' Whatever is set right, and as it should 
be, in the present evil state of the world, 
can be so only by the particular inter- 
position of God.' 

" x\n immediate revelation from hea- 
ven, therefore, was the only method 
by which hifinite wisdom and perfect 
goodness could reform a bewildered and 
vicious race. But this revelation, at 
whatever time we suppose it given, 
must have been made directly either to 
some chosen individuals commissioned 
to instruct others, or to every man and 
woman for whose benefit it was ultimate- 
ly intended. W^ere every person in- 
stiiicted in the knowledge of his duty 
by immediate inspiration, and wei'e the 
motives to practise it brought home to 
his mind bv God himself, human nature 
would be wholly changed; men would 
not be moral agents, nor by conse- 
quence be capable either of reward or 
of punishment. It remains, therefore, 
that, if God has been graciously pleased 
to enlighten and reform mankind, with- 
out destroying that moral nature which 
man possesses, he can have done it only 
by revealing his truth to certain chosen 
instmments, who were the immediate 
insti-uctors of their contemporaries, and 
through them have been the instructors 
of succeeding ages. 

"Let us suppose this to have been 
actually the case, and consider how' 
those inspired teachers could communi- 
cate to others every truth wliich had been 
revealed to themselves. They might 
easily, if it were part of their duty, t(»

deliver a sublime divine system of natu- 
ral and moral science, and establish it 
upon the common basis of experiment 
and demonstration : but what foundation 
could they lay for those truths which 
unassisted reason cannot discover, and 
which, when they are revealed, appear 
to have no necessaiy relation to any 
thing previously known ? To a bai'e 
affirmation that they had been imme- 
diately received from God, no rational 
being could be expected to assent. The 
teachers might be men of known vera- 
city, whose simple assertion would be 
admitted as sufficient \;vidence for any 
tact in conformity with the laws of na- 
ture ; but as e\'ery man has the evidence 
of his own consciousness and experience 
that revelations from heaven are devia- 
tions from these laws, an assertion so 
apparently extravagant would be re- 
jected as false, unless supported by some 
better proof than the mere affirmation 
of the teacher. In this state of things 
we can conceive no evidence sufficient 
to make such doctrines be received as 
the truths of God, but the power of 
working miracles committed to him 
who taught them. This would, indeed, 
be fully adequate tb the puipose : for 
if there were nothing in the doctrines 
themselves impious, immoral, or con- 
trary to truths already known, the only 
thing which could render the teacher's 
assertion incredible, would be its imply- 
ing such an intimate communion with 
God as is contrary to the established 
course of things, by which men are left 
to acquire all their knowledge by the 
exercise of their own faculties. Let us 
now suppose one of those inspired teach- 
ers to tell his countrymen, that he did not 
desire them, on his ipse dixit, to believe 
that he had any preternatural commu- 
nion with the Deity, but that, for the 
truth of his assertion, he would give 
them the evidence of their own senses ; 
and after this declaration, let us suppose 
him immediately to raise a person 
from the dead in their presence, mere- 
\y by calling upon him to come out of 
his grave. Would not the only possible 
objection to the man's veracity be re- 
moved by this miracle ? and his asser- 
tion that he had received such and such 
doctrines from God be as fully credited 
as if it related to the most common oc- 
currence? Undoubtedly it would; for 
when so much preternatural /io^yer was 
visibly communicated to this person, no 
one could have reason to question his 
having received an equal portion of pre- 
ternatural knowledge. A palpable de- 
viation from the known laws of nature 
ill one instance, is a sensible proof that 



such a deviation is possible in another ; 
and in such a case as this, it is the wit- 
ness of God to the truth of a man. 

" Miracles, then, under which we in- 
clude prophecy, are the only direct evi- 
dence which can be gi^'en of divine in- 
spiration. When a religion, or any re- 
ligious tnith, is to be revealed from 
heaven, they appear to be absolutely 
necessary to enforce its reception among 
men ; and this is the only case in which 
we can suppose them necessary, or be- 
lieve for a moment that they ever have 
been or will be performed. 

"The history of almost every reli- 
gion abounds with relations of prodigies 
and wonders, and of the intercourse of 
men with the gods ; but we know of no 
religious system, those of the Jews and 
Christians excepted, which appealed to 
miracles as the sole evidence ot its truth 
and divinity. The pretended miracles 
mentioned by Pagan historians and 
poets, are not said to have been public- 
ly wrought to enforce the truth of a new 
religion, contrary to the reigning idola- 
try. Many of them may be clearly 
shown to have been mere natural 
events ; others of them are represented 
as ha\'ing been performed in secret ou 
the most trivial occasions, and in ob- 
scure and fabulous ages long prior to 
the era of the writers by whom they 
are recorded ; and such of them as at 
first view appear to be best attested, 
are evidently tricks contrived for in- 
terested purposes, to flatter power, or 
to promote the prevailing superstitions. 
For these reasons, as well as on account 
of the immoral character of the divini- 
ties by whom they are said to have been 
wrought, they are altogether unworthy 
of examination, and carry in the very 
nature of them the completest proofs 
of falsehood and imposture. 

"Bflt the miracles recorded of Mo- 
ses and of Christ bear a very different 
character. None of them are repre- 
sented as wrought on trivial occasions. 
The writers who mention them were 
eye-witnesses of the facts ; which they 
affirm to have been performed publicly, 
in attestation of the truth of their re- 
spective systems. They are, indeed, 
so incorporated with these systems, 
that the miracles cannot be separated 
from the doctrines ; and if the miracles 
be not really performed, the doctrines 
cannot possibly be true. Besides all this, 
they were wrought in support of reve- 
lations which opposed all the religious 
systems, superstitions, and prejudices, 
of the age in which they were given ; 
a circumstance which of itself sets them, 
in point of authority, infinitely above

Ihe Pagan prodigies, as well as the ly- 
ing wonders of the Roniish church. 

" It is indeed, we believe, universally 
admitted, that the miracles mentioned 
in the book of Exodus, and in the four 
Gospels, might, to those who saw them 

Serformed, be sufficient evidence of the 
ivine inspiration of Moses and of Christ ; 
but to us it may be thought that they are 
no evidence whatever, as we must be- 
lieve in the miracles themselves, if we 
believe in them at all, upon the bare 
authority of human testimony. W^hy, it 
has been sometimes asked, are not mi- 
racles wrouglit in all ages and coun- 
tries ? If the religion of Christ was to be 
of perpetual duration, every generation 
of men ought to have complete evidence 
of its truth and divinity. 

" To the performance of miracles in 
every age and in e\'ery country, pei'- 
haps the same objections lie, as to the 
immediate inspiration of every indi- 
vidual. Were those miracles univer- 
sally received as such, men would be so 
overwhelmed with the number rather 
than with the force of their autliointy, 
as hardly to remain masters of their 
own conduct ; and in that case the very 
end of all miracles would be defeated by 
their frequency. The truth, however, 
seems to be, that miracles so frequently 
repeated would not be received as such, 
and of course would have no authority ; 
because it would be difficult, and in 
many cases impossible, to distinguish 
them from natural events. If they re- 
curred regulai'ly at certain intervals, we 
Gould not prove them to be deviations 
from the known laws of nature, becaus'e 
we should have the same experience 
foi" one series of events as for the other ; 
for the regular succession of preterna- 
tural effects, as for the estaljlished con- 
stitution and course of things. 

" Be this, however, as it may, we 
shall take the liberty to affirm, that for 
the reality of the Gospel miracles, we 
have evid,ence as convincing to the I'e- 
flecting mind, though not so striking to 
vulgar apprehension, as those had who 
were contemporary with Christ and his 
apostles, and actually saw the mighty 
works which he performed. Mr. Hume, 
indeed, endeavoured to prove, that ' no 
testimony is sufficient to establish a 
miracle ;' and the reasoning employed 
for this pui-pose is, that ' a miracle being 
a violation of the laws of nature, which 
a firm and unalteral^le experience has 
established, the proof against a miracle, 
from the very nature of the fact, is as 
entire as any argument from experience 
can be : whereas our experience of hu- 
man veracity, which (according to him) 



is the sole foundation of the evidence of 
testimony, as far from being uniform, 
and can therefore never preponderate 
against that experience which admits of 
no exception.' This botisted and plau- 
sible argument has with equal candour 
and acuteness been examined by Dr. 
Campbell, in his Dissertation on Mira- 
cles, who justly observes, that so far is 
experience from being the sole founda- 
tion of the evidence of testimony, that, 
on the contraiy, testimony is the sole 
foundation of by far the greater part of 
what Mr. Hume calls firm and unalter- 
al)le experience ; and that if, in certain 
circumstances, we did not give an im- 
plicit faith to testimony, our knoAvledge 
of events would be confined to those 
which had fallen under the immediate 
observation of our own senses. 

"We need not waste time here in 
proving that the miracles, as they are 
presented in the writings of the New 
Testament, were of such a nature, and 
performed before so many witnesses, 
that no imposition could possibly be 
practised on the senses of those who af- 
hrm that they were present. From 
every page of the Gospel this is so evi- 
dent, that the philosophical adversaries 
of the Christian faith never suppose 
the apostles to have been themselves 
deceived, but boldly accuse them of 
bearing false witness. But if this accu- 
sation be well founded, their testimony 
itself is as great a miracle as any which 
they record of themselves, or of their 
Master. For if they sat down to fabri- 
cate their pretended revelation, and to 
contrive a series of miracles to which 
they were unanimously to appeal for its 
truth, it is plain, since they proved suc- 
cessful in their daring enterprise, that 
they must have clearly foreseen every 
possible circumstance in vvhich they 
could be placed, and have prepared 
consistent answers to every question 
that could be put to them by their most 
inveterate and most enlightened ene- 
mies ; by the statesman, the lawyer, the 
philosopher, and the priest. That such 
foreknowledge as this would have Ijeeu 
miraculous, will not surely be, denied : 
since it forms the very attribute which 
we find it the most difficult to allow 
even to God himself. It is not, however, 
the 0)ihj miracle which this supposition 
would compel us to swallow. The very. 
resolution of the apostles to pi'opagate 
the belief of false miracles in sup])ort of 
sucli a religion as that which is taught 
in the New Testament, is as great a mi- 
racle as human imagination can easily 
conceive.

thcr they must have hoped to s\icceed, 
or they must have foreseen that they 
should fail in their undertaking ; and, in 
either case, they chose evil for its oiuii 
sake. They could not, if they fore- 
saw that they should fail, look for any 
thing but that contempt, disgrace, and 
persecution, which were then the inevi- 
table consequences of an unsuccessful 
endeavour to overthrow the established 
religion. Nor could their prospects be 
brighter upon the supposition of their 
success. As they knew themselves to be 
false witnesses, and impious deceivers, 
they could have no hopes beyond the 
grave; and by detemiming to oppose 
all the religious systems, supei-stitions, 
and prejudices of the age in which they 
lived, they wilfully exposed themselves 
to inevitable misery in the present life, 
to insult and imprisonment, to stripes 
and death. Nor can it be said that they 
might look forward to power and afflu- 
ence, when they should through suf- 
ferings have converted their country- 
men ; for so desirous were they of ob- 
taining nothing but misery, as the end of 
their mission, that they made their own 
persecution a test of the truth of their 
doctrines. They introduced the Mas- 
ter from whom they pretended to ha\ e 
received these doctrines as telling them, 
that • they were sent forth as shee]) in 
the midst of wolves : that they should 
be delivered up to coiuicils, and scourg- 
ed ui synagogues ; that they should be 
hated of all men for his name's sake ; 
that the brother should deliver up the 
brother to death, 'and the father the 
child ; and tliat he who took not up his 
cross, and followed after him, was not 
worthy of him.' The very system of 
religion, therefore, wliich they invented 
and resolved to impose upon mankind, 
was so contrived, that the worldly pros- 
perity of its first preachers, and even 
their exemption from persecution, was 
incompatible with its success. Had 
these clear predictions of the Author of 
that religion, under whom the apostles 
acted only as ministers not been veri- 
fied, all mankind must have instantly 
perceiv(i[l that their pretence to inspi- 
ration was false, and that Christianity 
was a scandalous and impudent impos- 
ture. All this the apostles could not 
but foresee when they formed their 
plan for deluding the world. Whence 
it follows, that when they resolved to 
support their pretended revelation by 
an appeal to forged miracles, they wil- 
fully, and with their eyes open, exposed 
themselvesto inevitable misery, whether 
they should succeed or fail in their en- 
tci-prise j and that they concerted their 



measures so as not to admit of a possi- 
bility of recompence to themselves, 
either in this life or in that which is to 
come. But if there be a law of nature, 
for the reality of which we have better 
evidence than we have for others, it is, 
that ' no man can choose miseiy for its 
onvn sakej' or make the acquisition of it 
the ultimate end of his pursuit. The 
existence of other laws of nature we 
know by testimony, and our own obser- 
vation of the regularity of their effects. 
The existence ot this law is made known 
to us not only by these means, but also 
by the still clearer and more conclusive 
evidence of our own consciousness. 

" Thus, then, do miracles force them- 
selves upon our assent in every possible 
view which we can take of this inte- 
resting subject. If the testimony of the 
first preachers of Christianity were 
tnie, the miracles recorded in the Gos- 
pel were certainly performed, and the 
doctrines of our religion are derived 
from heaven. On the other hand, if 
that testimony were false, either God 
must have miraculously effaced from 
the minds of those by whom it was 
given, all the associations fornied be- 
tween their sensible ideas and the words 
of language, or he must have endowed 
those men with the gift of prescience, 
and ha^e impelled them to fabricate a 
pretended revelation for the purpose of 
deceiving the world, and involving them- 
selves in ccrtam and foreseen deStmc- 
tion. 

"The power necessary to perform 
the one series of these miracles may, 
for any thing known to us, be as great 
as that which would be requisite for the 
performance of the other ; and, con- 
sidered merely as exertions of preter- 
natural power, they may seem to ba- 
lance each other, and to hold the mind 
in a state of suspense ; but when we 
take into consideration the diffeient 
purposes for which these opposite and 
contending miracles were wrought, the 
balance is instantly desti-oyed. The mi- 
racles recorded in the Gospels, if real, 
were wrought in support of a revelation 
which, in the opinion of all by yvhom it 
is received, has brought to light many 
important tiiiths which could not other- 
wise have been made known to men ; 
and which, by the confession of its ad- 
versaries, contains the purest moral pre- 
cepts by which the conduct of mankiiid 
was ever directed. The opposite series 
of miracles, if real, was performed to 
enable, and even to compel, a company 
of Jews, of the lowest rank and of the 
narrowest education, to fabricate, with 
the view of inevitable destiiiction to

themselves, a consistent scheme of 
falsehood, and by an appeal to forged 
miracles to impose it upon the world as 
a revelation from heaven. The object 
of the former miracles is worthy of a 
God of infinite wisdom, goodness, and 

{)ower; the object of the latter is abso- 
utely inconsistent with wisdom and 
goodness, which are demonstrably at- 
tributes of that Being by whom alone 
miracles can be pei-formed. Whence 
it follows, that the supposition of the 
apostles bearing false testimony to the 
miracles of then- Master, implies a se- 
ries of deviations from the laws of na- 
ture infinitely less probable in them- 
selves than those miracles : and there- 
fore, by Mr. Hume's maxim, we must 
necessarily reject the supposition of 
falsehood in the testimony, and admit 
the reality of the miracles. So true it is, 
that for the reality of the Gospel mira- 
cles we have evidence as convincing to 
the reflecting mind as those had who 
Avei-e contemporary with Christ and his 
apostles, and were actual witnesses to 
their mighty works." 

The power of working miracles is 
supposed by some to ha\e been conti- 
nued no longer than the apostles' days. 
Others think that it v^as continued long 
after. It seems pretty clear, however, 
that miracles universally ceased before 
Chi'ysostom's time. As for v/hat Au- 
gustme says of those wrought at the 
tombs of the martyrs, and some other 
places, in his time, the evidence is not 
always so convincing as might be de- 
sired in facts of importance. The con- 
troversy concei'ning the time when mi- 
raculous powei's ceased was carried on 
by Dr. Middleton, in his Free Enquiry 
into the* Miraculous Powers, &amp;c. by 
IMr. Yate, Mr. Toll, and others, who 
suppose that miracles ceased with the 
apostles. On the contrary side appear- 
ed Dr. Stebbing, Dr. Chapman, Mr. 
Parker, Mr. Brooke, and otlicrs. 

As to the miracles of the Romish 
church, it is evident, as Doddridge ob- 
serves, that man}' of them were ridicu- 
lous talcs, according to their own his- 
torians ; others were performed with- 
out any credible witnesses, or in circum- 
stances where the performer had the 
greatest opportunity of juggling; and it 
is particularly remarkable, that the}- 
were hardly ever wrought where they 
seem most necessar}% i. e. in countries 
where those doctrines are renounced 
which that church esteems of the high- 
est importance. See Fleetivood, Clara- 
fiede, Conybeare, Campbell, Lardner,

MIRTH, joy, gaiety, merriment. It is 
distinguished from cheerfulness thus : 
Mirth is considered as an act; cheer- 
fulness an habit of the mind. Mirth 
IS short and transient ; cheerfulness 
fixed and permanent. " Those are of- 
ten raised into the greatest transpoi'ts 
of mirth who are suliject to the greatest 
depressions of melancholy ; on the con- 
trary, cheerfidness, though it does not 
give such an exquisite gladness, pre- 
vents us from falhnginto any depths of 
sorrow: Mirth is like a flash of light- 
ning, that breaks through a gloom of 
clouds, and glitters for a moment ; 
cheerfulness keeps up a kind of day- 
light in the mind, and fills it with a 
steady and penietual serenity." Mirth 
is sinful, 1. When men rejoice in that 
which is evil. 2. When unreasonable, 
3. When tending to commit sin. A. 
When a hindrance to duty. 5. When 
it is blasphemous and profane. 

MISANTHROPIST, ,i,crave?ow., a 
hater of mankind ; one that abaixlons 
society from a principle of discontent 
The consideration of the depravity of 
human nature is certainly enough to 
raise emotions of sorrow in the breast 
of every man of the least sensibility ; 
yet it is our duty to bear with the follies 
of mankind ; to exercise a degree of 
candour consistent with tnith ; to lessen, 
if possible, by our exertions, the simi of 
moral and natural evil ; and by con- 
necting ourseh^es with society, to add 
at least something to the general in- 
terests of mankind. The misanthropist, 
therefore, is an ungenerous and dis- 
honourable character. Disgusted with 
life, he seeks a retreat ft-om it : like a 
coward, he flees from the scene of ac- 
tion, while he increases his own misery 
by liis natural discontent, and leaves 
othei*s to do what they can for them- 
selves. 

The following is his character more 
at large. 

"He is a man," says Saurin, "who 
avoids society only to free himself from 
the trouble of being useful to it. He is 
a man, who considers his neighbours 
only on the side of their defects, not 
knowing the art of combining their vir- 
tues with their vices, and of rendering 
the imperfections of other people tole- 
rable by reflecting on his own. He is a 
man more employed in finding out and 
inflicting punishments on the guilty than 
in devising means to reform them. He 
is a man, who talks of nothing but ba- 
nishing and executing, and who, because 



MIS 



380 



MIS 



he thinks his. talents are not sufficiently 
valued and employed by his fellow-citi- 
zens, or rather because they know his 
foibles, and do not choose to be subject 
to his caprice, talks of quitting cities, 
towns, and societies, and of living in 
dens or deserts." 

MISER, a term formerly used in re- 
ference to a. person in wretchedness or 
calamity ; but now denotes a parsimo- 
nious person, or one who is covetous to 
extremity ; who denies himself even the 
comforts of life to accumulate wealth. 
A^'arice, says Saurin, may be considered 
in two different points of light. It may 
be considered in those men, or rather 
those public blood-suckers, or, as the 
officers of the Roman emperor Vespa- 
sian were called, those sfionges of socie- 
ty, who, infatuated with this passion, seek 
after riches as the supreme good, deter- 
mine to acquire it by any methods, and 
consider the ways that "lead to wealth, 
legal or illegal, as the only road for 
them to travel. 

Avarice, however, must be consi- 
dered in a second point of light. It not 
only consists in committing bold crimes, 
but in entertaining mean ideas and prac- 
tising low methods, incompatible with 
such magnanimity as our condition 
ought to inspire. It consists not only in 
omitting to serve God, but in trying to 
associate the service of God with that 
of mammon. 

How many forms doth avarice take 
to disguise itself from the man who is 
guilty of it, and who will be drenched 
in the g-uilt of it till the day he dies! 
Sometimes it is prudence which re- 
quii-es him to provide not only for his 
present wants, but for such as he may 
ha\-e in future. Sometimes it is charity 
■which requires him not to give society 
examples of prodigality and parade. 
Sometimes it \% Jiarentdl love obliging 
him to save something for his children. 
Sometimes it is circumspection, which 
requires him not to supply people who 
make an ill use of what they get. Some- 
times it is necessity, which oljliges him 
to repel artifice by artifice. Sometimes 
it is conscience, which convinces him, 
good man, that he hath already exceed- 
ed in compassion and alms-giving, and 
done too much. Sometimes it is equity, 
for justice requires that every one 
should enjoy the fruit of his OAvn la- 
bours, and those of his ancestors. Such, 
tilas ! are the awful pretexts and subter- 
fuges of the miser. Saurin's Ser. vol. v.

MISERY, such a state of wretch-

MISCHNA, or Misna (from njty, 
iteravit,) a part of the Jewish Talmud. 

The Mischna contains the text ; and 
the Gemara, which is the second part 
of the Talmud, contains the commenta- 
ries: so that the Gemara is, as it were, 
a glossary on the Mischna. 

The Mischna consists of various tra- 
ditions of the Jews, and of explanations 
of several passages of Scripture : these 
traditions serving as an explication of 
the written law, and supplement to it, 
are said to have been delivered to Mor 
ses during the time of his abode on the 
Mount ; which he afterwards communi- 
cated to Aaron, Eleazar, and his ser- 
vant Joshua. By these they were trans- 
mitted to the seventy elders ; by them 
to the prophets, who communicated 
them to the men of the great sanhe- 
drim, from whom the wise men of Je- 
rusalem and Babylon received them. 
According to Prideaux's account, they 
passed from Jeremiah to Bainich, from 
liim to Ezra, and from Ezra to the men 
of the CTeat synagogiie, the last of whom 
was Simon the Just, who delivered 
them to Antigonus of Socho : and from 
him they came down in regular suc- 
cession to Simeon, who took our Saviour 
in his arms ; to Gamaliel, at whose feet 
Paul was educated ; and last of all, to 
Rabbi Judah the Holy, who committed 
them to writing in the Mischna. But 
Dr. Prideaux, rejecting the Jewish fic- 
tion, observes, that after the death of 
Simon the Just, about 299 years before 
Christ, the Mischnical doctors arose, 
who by their comments and conclusions 
added to the number of those traditions 
which had been received and allowed 
by Ezra and the men of the great syna- 
gogue ; so that towards the middle of 
the second century after Christ, under 
the empire of Antoninus Pius, it was 
found necessary to commit these tradi- 
tions to writing ; more especially as 
their country had considerably sunered 
under Adrian, and many of their schools 
had been dissolved, and their learned 
men cut off; and therefore the usual 
method of preserving their traditions 
had failed. Rabbi Judah on this occa- 
sion being rector of the school of T'be- 
rias, and president of the sanhedrim in 
that place, undertook the work, and 
compiled it in six books, each consisting 
of several tracts, which altogether make 
up the number of sixty-three. JPrid. 
Connex. vol. ii. p. 468, &amp;c. ed. 9. This 
learned author computes, that the 
Mischna was composed about the 150th 
year of our Lord; but Dr. Lightfoot 



MIS 



3Sl 



MIS 



says that the Rabbi Judah compiled the 
Mischna about the year of Christ 190, in 
the latter end of the reign of Commo- 
dus ; or, as some compute, in the year of 
Christ 220. Di-. Lardner is of opinion 
that this work could not have been 
finished before the year 190, or later. 
Collection of Jeunsh and Heathen Tes- 
timo7iies, vol. i. p. 178. Thus the book 
called the Mischna was formed ; a book 
which the Jews ha\^e generally re- 
ceived with the greatest veneration. 
The original has been published with a 
Latin translation by Surenhusius, with 
notes of his own and others from the 
learned Maimonides, &amp;c. in six vols. fol. 
Amster. A. D. 1698—1703. See Tal- 
mud. It is written in a much purer 
style, and is not near so full of dreams 
and visions as the Gemara. 

MISREPRESENTATION, the act 
of wilfully representing a thing other- 
wise than it is. " This," as an elegant 
writer observes, " is one of the greatest 
mischiefs of conversation. Self-love is 
continually at work to give to all we say 
a bias in our own favour. How often in 
society, otherwise respectable, are Ave 
pained with narrations in which preju- 
dice warps, and self-love blinds ! — How 
often do we see that withholding part of 
a truth answers tlie worst ends of a 
falsehood ! How often regret the unfair 
tuni given to a cause, by placing a senti- 
ment in one pomt of view, which the 
speaker had used in another ! the letter 
of truth preserved, where its spirit is 
violated ! a superstitious exactness scru- 
pulously maintained in the under parts 
of a detail, in order to impress such an 
idea of integrity as shall gain credit for 
the misrefire^enter, while he is design- 
edly mistaking the leading principle ! 
How may we obsei^ve a new character 
given to a fact by a different look, tone, 
or emphasis, which alters it as much as 
words could have done ! the false im- 
pression of a sermon conveyed, when 
we do not like the preacher, or when 
through him we wish to make religion 
itself ridiculous ! the c&amp;re to avoid lite- 
ral untruths, while the mischief is bet- 
ter effected by the unfair quotation of a 
passage divested of its context ! the 
bringing together detached portions of a 
subject, and making those parts ludi- 
ci'ous, when connected, which were se- 
rious in their distinct position ! the in- 
sidious use made of a. sentiment by re- 
presenting it as the o^iinion of him who 
had only brought it forward in order to 
expose it ! the relating opinions which 
had merely been put hypothetical! y, as 
if they were the avowed principles of 
him we would discredit ' that subtle 



falsehood which is so made to incorpo- 
rate with a certain quantity of truth, 
that the most skilful moral chemist 
cannot analyze or sepai-ate them ! for a 
good misrepresent er knows that a suc- 
cessful lie must have a certain infusion 
of tiiith, or it will not go down. And 
this amalgamation is the test of his 
skill ; as too much truth would defeat 
the end of his* mischief, and too little 
would destroy the belief of the hearer. 
All that indefinable ambiguity and equi- 
vocation ; all that piTident deceit, which 
is rather implied than expressed ; those 
more delicate artifices of the school of 
Lovala and of Chesterfield, which al- 
low us, when we dare not deny a truth, 
yet so to disguise and discolour it, that 
the truth we relate shall not resemble 
the truth we heard ; these, and all the 
thousand shades of simulation and dis- 
simulation, will be carefully guarded 
against in the conversation of vigilant 
Christians." — Miss H. More on Educ. 
vol. ii. p. 91. 

MISSAL, the Romish mass-book, 
containing the several masses to be said 
on particular days. It. is derived from 
the Latin word missa, which in the an- 
cient Christian church signified eveiy 
part of divine service. 

MISSION, a power or commission 
to preach the Gospel. Thus Jesus 
Christ gave his disciples their mission, 
when he said, " go ye into all the world, 
and preach the Gospel to every crea- 
ture. See next article. 

MISSION, an establishment of peo- 
ple zealous for the glory of God and the 
salvation of souls, who go and preach 
the Gospel in remote countries, and 
among infidels. No man possessed of 
the least degree of feeling or compas- 
sion for the human race can deny the 
necessity and utility of Christian mis- 
sions. Whoever considers that the ma- 
jor part of the world is enveloped in the 
grossest darkness, bound with tlie chains 
of savage barbarity, and immersed in 
the awtul chaos of brutal ignorance, 
must, if he be not destitute of every 
pi'inciple of religion and liumaYiity, con- 
cur with the design and applaud the 
principles of those who engage in so be- 
nevolent a work. We shall not, how- 
ever, in this place, enter into a defence 
of missions, but shall present tlie reader 
with a short view of those that have 
been established. 

In the sixteenth century, the Romish 
church particularly exerted herself for 
the propagation ot their religion. The 
Portuguese and Spaniards pretend to 
have done mighty exploits in the spread 
of the Christian faith in Asia, Africa, 



MIS

MIS 



and America ; but, when we consider 
the supei-stitions they imposed on some, 
and the dreadful cnielties they inflicted 
on others, it more than counterbalances 
'any good that was done. For a time, 
the Dominicans, Franciscans, and other 
religious orders, were very zealous in 
the conversion of the heathen ; but the 
Jesuits outdid them all in their attempts 
in the conversion of AfWcan, Asian, and 
American infidels. Javier spread some 
hints of the Romish religion through the 
Portuguese settlements in the East In- 
dies, through most of the Indian conti- 
nent, and of Ceylon. In 1549 he sailed 
to Japan, and laid the foundation of 
a church there, which at one time 
was said to have consisted of about 
600,000 Christians. After him, others 
penetrated into China, and founded a 
church which continued aljout 170 years. 
About 1580, others penetrated into' Chili 
and Pern, in South America, and con- ' 
verted the natives. Others bestirred 
themselves to convert the Greeks, Nes- 
torians, Monophysites, Abyssinians, the 
Egyptian Copts. "It is, hovve\""er," as 
one obsen^es, "a matter of doubt whe- 
ther the disciples of a Xavier, or the con- 
verts of a Loyola and Dominic, with 
their partisans of the Romish church, \ 
should be admitted among the number 
of Christians, or their labours be thought 
to have contributed to the promotion or 
to the hindrance of the religion of 
Christ. Certain it is, that the methods 
these men pursued tended niuch more 
to make disciples to themselves and 
the pontiffs of Rome, than to form the 
mind to the recejjtion of evangelical 
truth." With ardent zeal, however, and 
unwearied industry, these apostles la- 
boured in this work. In 1622 we find 
the pope established a congregation of 
cardinals, de Jiropagandu jide, and en- 
dowed it with ample revenues, and 
every thing which could forward the 
missions was liberally supplied. In 1627, 
also. Urban added the college for the 
propagation of the faith; in which mis- 
sionaries were taught the languages of 
-the covmtries to which they were to be 
sent. France copied the example of 
Rome, and formed an establishment for 
the same purposes. The Jesuits claim- 
ed the first rank, as due to their zeal, 
learning, and devotedness to the holy i 
see. The Dominicans, Franciscans, and 
others, disputed the palm with tliem. 
"The new world and the Asiatic regions 
were the chief field of their labours. 
They penetrated into the uncultivated 
recesses of America. They visited the 
vmtried regions of Siam, Tonq\iin, ajid 
Cochin China. They entered the vastj 



empire of China itself, and numbered 
millions among their converts. They 
dared affront the dangers of the tyran- 
nical government of Japan. In India 
they assumed the garb and austerities 
of the Brahmins, and boasted on the 
coasts of Malabar of a thousand con- 
verts baptized in one year by a single 
missionary. Their sufferings however, 
were very great, and in China and Ja- 
pan they were exposed to the most 
dreadlid persecutions, and many thou- 
sands were cut off, with, at last, a final 
expulsion from the empires. In Africa 
the Capuchins were chiefly employed, 
though it does not appear that they 
had any considerable success. And in 
America their laborious exertions have 
had but little influence, we fear to pro- 
mote the real conversion of the natives 
to the truth. 

In the year 1621, the Dutch opened 
a church in the city of Batavia, and 
from hence ministers were sent to Am- 
boyna. At Leyden, ministers and assis- 
tants were educated for the pui-pose of 
missions under the famous W^alxus, and 
sent into the East, where thousands em- 
braced the Christian religion at For- 
mosa, Columba, Java, Malabar, Sec. and 
though the work declined in some 
places, yet there are still churches in 
Ceylon, Sumatra, Amboyna, 8cc. 

About 1705, Frederick IV. of Den- 
mark, applied to the university of Halle, 
in Germany, for missionaries to preach 
the Gospel on the coast of Malabar, in 
the East Indies; and Messrs. Ziegenbalg 
and Plutsche were the first employed 
on this important mission ; to them 
others were soon added, who laboured 
with considerable success. It is said 
that upwards of 18,000 Gcntoos have 
been brought to the profession of Chris- 
tianity. 

A great work has been carried on 
among the Indian nations in N'orth 
America. One of the first and most 
eminent instruments in this work was 
the excellent iMr. Elliott, commonly 
called the Indian apostle, who, from 
the time of his going to New England, 
in 1631, to his death, in 1690, devoted 
himself to this great work by his lips 
and peh, translating the Bible and other 
books into the natic dialect. Some years 
after this, Thomas Mahew, esq. gover- 
nor and patentee of the islands of Mar- 
tha's Vineyard, and some neighbouring 
islands, greatly exerted himself in the 
attempt to convert the Indians in that 
part of America. His son John gather- 
ed and founded an Indian church, which, 
after his death, not being' able to pay a 
minister, the old gentleman himself, at

seventy years of age, became their in- 
structor for more than twent) years, 
and his grandson and great grandson 
both succeeded him in the same work. 
Mr. D. Bi'ainard was also a truly pious 
and successful missionary among the 
Susquehannah and Delaware Indians. 
His journal contains instances of very 
extraordinary conversions. 

But the Jiloravians have exceeded 
all in their missionary exertions. They 
have various missions : and, by their 
persevering zeal, it is sa'd, upwards of 
23,000 of the most destitute of mankind, 
in different regions of the earth, have 
been brought to the knowledge of the 
truth. Vast numbers in the Danish 
islands of St. Thomas, St. Jau, and St. 
Croix, and the English islands of Ja- 
maica, Antigua, Nevis, Barbadocs, St. 
Kitts, and Tobago, have by their minis- 
try been called to worship God in spirit 
and in truth. In the inhos]jitable clim.es, 
of Greenland and Labrador they have 
met with wonderfid success, after un- 
dergoing the most astonishing dangers 
and difficulties. The Arrowack Indians, 
and the negix&gt;es of Surinam and Ber- 
bice, have been collectetl into bodies of 
faithful people by them. Canada and 
the United States of North America, 
have, by their instrumentality, afforded 
happy evidences of the power of the 
Gospel. Even those esteemed the last 
of human beings, for brutishness and 
ignorance, the Hottentots, have been 
formed into their societies ; and up- 
wards of seven hundred are said to be 
worshipping God at Bavian's Cloof, 
near the tape of Good Hope. We 
might also mention their efforts to illu- 
mine the distant East, the coast of 
Coromandel, and the Nicobar islands; 
their attempts to penetrate iiito Abys- 
sinia, to carry the Gospel to Persia and 
Egypt, and to ascend the mountains of 
Caucasus. In fact, where shall we find 
the men who have laboured as these 
have } Their invincible patience, their 
well-regulated zeal, their self-denial, 
their constant prudence, deserve the 
meed of highest appi'obation. Nor are 
they wearied in so honourable a ser- 
vice ; for they have numerous mission- 
aries still emjjloyed in different parts of 
the world. See'MoRAviANS. 

Good has been also done by the Wes- 
leijan Method'ists, who are certainly not 
the least in missionary work. They have 
several missionaries in the British do- 
minions in America and in the West 
Indies. They have some thousands of 
members in their societies in those 
parts. See Methodists. 

In 1791, a society was instituted 



among the Baptists, called, " The Par- 
ticular Baptist Society for propagating 
the Gospel among the Heathen ^' un- 
der the auspices of which missionaries 
were sent to India, and favourable ac- 
counts of their success have been re- 
ceived. We learn, with pleasure, that 
through their indefatigable industiy, the 
New Testament, and part of the Bible 
have been translated and printed in the 
Bengalee ; and that parts of the Scrip- 
tures have been translated into ten of 
the lajiguages spoken in the East. Sec 
Periodical Accounts of this society. 

In the year 1795, The London Mis- 
siojHiry Society was formed. — This is 
not confined to one body of people, but 
consists of Episcopalians, Presbyterians, 
Scccders, Methodists, and Indepen- 
dents, who hold an annual meeting in 
London in May. As the state of this so- 
ciety is before the public, it would be 
unnecessary here to enlarge ; suffice it 
to say, tha.t it is now on the most per- 
manent and respectable footing. "It 
has assumed consistency and order; it 
combines integrity of character, forti- 
tude of mind, and fixedness of resolu- 
tion, with a continued ])rogression of ef- 
fort for the exalted purpose of present- 
ing the doctrines of the blessed Gospel 
to the acceptance of the pei'ishing hea- 
tlien, and of exhibiting an uncorrupt 
example of their tendencies and effects 
in then- own chai'acters and conduct." 

Besides the above-mentioned societies, 
others have been formed of less note. In 
1699, a society was instituted in England 
ihr /u~o?noting Christian Knoivledge. In 
irOl, another was formed for the pro- 
pagation of the Gospel in foreign parts. 
In Scotland, about the year 1700, a so- 
ciety was instituted for the Propagation 
of Christio7i Knoivledge. Recently, some 
clergymen of the established church 
have formed one among themselves. 
Societies for spreading the Gospel also 
have been instituted in various other 
places. From the whole, it seems evi- 
dent that the light and knowledge of the 
glorious Gospel will be more diffused 
than ever throughout the earth. And 
who is there that has any concern for 
the souls of men, any love for truth and 
religion, but what must rejoice at the 
formation, number, and success of those 
institutions, which have not the mere 
temporal concerns of men, but their 
everlasting welfare as their object ^ My 
heart overflows with joy, and mine eyes 
with tears, when I consider the happy 
and extensive effects which are likely 
to take place. The untutored mind will

MODERATION, the state of keep- 
ing a due mean between extremes : 
calmness, temperance, or equanimity. 
It is sometimes used with reference to 
our opinions, Uom. xii. 3. but in general 
it respects our conduct in that state 
which (lomes under the description of 
ease or prospei-ity ; and ought to take 
place in our wishes, pursuits, expecta- 
tions, pleasures, and passions. See Rfi. 
Hall on Moderation, ser. 16 ; Blair's 
Sermons, vol. iii. ser. 12; To/ilady's 
Works, vol. iii. ser. 10. 

MODESTY is sometimes used to de- 
note humility, and sometimes to ex- 
press chastity. The Greek word Koo-uios 
modestns, signifies neat or clean. Mo- 
desty, therefore, consists in purity of 
sentiment and manners, inclinmg us to 
ablior the least appearance of vice and 
indecency, and to fear doing any thing 
which will incur censure. An excess of 
modesty may be called bashfulness, and 
the want of it impertinence. There is a 
false or vicious modesty, which influ- 
ences a man to do any thing that is ill or 
indiscreet ; such as, thi'ough fear of of- 
fending his companions he runs into 
their follies or excesses ; or it is a false 
modesty which restrains a man from 
doing what is good or laudable ; such 
as being ashamed to speak of religion, 
and to be seen in the exercises of piv;ty 
and devotion. 

MOLINISTS, a sect in the Romish 
church who follow the doctrine and sen- 
timents of the Jesuit Molina, relating to 
sufhcient and efficacious grace. He 
taught that the operations of divine 
grace wei'e entirely consistent with the 



freedom of the human will ; and intro- 
duced a new kind of hypothesis to re- 
move the difficult'cs attending the doc- 
trines of predestination and liberty, and 
to I'econcile the jarring opinions of Au- 
gustines, Thomists, Semi-Pelagians, and 
other contentious divines. He affirmed 
that the decree of predestination to eter- 
nal glory was fovmded upon a previous 
knowledge and consideration of the 
merits of the elect ; that the grace, from 
whose operation these merits ai-e de- 
rived, is not efficacious by its own intrin- 
sic power only, but also by the consent 
of our own will, and because it is admi- 
nistered in those circumstances in which 
the Deity, by that branch of his know- 
ledge which is called scientia media, 
foresees that it will be efficacious. The 
kind of prescience, denominated in the 
schools scientia 77iedia, is that foreknow- 
ledge of future contingents that arises 
from an acquaintance with the nature 
and faculties of rational beings, of the 
circumstances in which they shall be 
placed, of the objects that shall be pre- 
sented to them, and of the influence 
which their circumstances and objects 
must have on their actions. 

MONARCHIANS, the same as the 
Patripassians ; which see. 

MONASTERY, a convent or house 
built for tlie reception of religious ; 
whether it be abbey, priory, nunnery, 
or the like. 

Monasteiy is only properly applied to 
the houses of monks, mendicant friars, 
and nuns : the rest are more properly 
called religious houses. For the origin 
of monasteries, see Monastic, and 
Monk. 

The houses belonging to the several 
religious orders which obtained in Eng- 
land and -Wales, were cathedrals, col- 
leges, abbeys, priories, preceptories, 
commandries, hospitals, friaries, her- 
mitages, chantries, and free chapels. — 
These were under the direction and 
management of various officers. The 
dissolution of houses of this kind began 
so early as the year 1312, when the 
Templars were suppressed; and in 1323, 
their lands, churches, advowsons, and 
liberties, here in England, were given, 
by 17 Edw. U. stat. 3, to the prior and 
brethren of the hospital of St. John of 
Jerusalem. In the years 1390, 1437, 
1441, 1459, 1497, 1505, 1508, and 1515, 
several other houses were dissolved, 
and their revenues settled on different 
colleges in Oxford and Cambridge. 
Soon after the last period, cardinal 
Wolsey, by licence of the king and 
ipope, obtained a dissolution of above 
I thirty I'cligious houses for tlie founding

dnd endowing his colleges at Oxford 
and Ipswich. About the same time a 
bull was granted by the same pope to 
cardinal Wolsey to suppress monaste- 
ries, where there were not above six 
monks, to the value of eight thousand 
ducats a year, for endowing Windsor 
and King's College in Cambridge ; and 
two other bulls were granted to cardi- 
nals Wolsey and Campeius, where there 
Avere less than twelve monks, and to an- 
nex them to the greater monasteries ; 
and another bull to the same cardinals 
to inquire about abbeys to be suppress- 
ed in order to be made cathedrals. Al- 
though nothing appears to have been 
done in consecjuence of these bulls, the 
motive which induced Wolsey and many 
others to suppress these houses was the 
desire of promoting learning ; and arch- 
bishop Cranmer engaged in it with a 
view of carrying on the reformation. 
There were other causes that concur- 
red to bring on their ruin : many of the 
religious were loose and vicious ; the 
monks were generally thought to be in 
their hearts attached to the pope's su- 
premacy ; their revenues were not em- 
ployed according to the intent of the 
donors ; many cheats in images, feigned 
miracles, and counterfeit relics, had j 
been discovered, which brought the 
monks into disgrace ; the observant 
friars had opposed the king's divorce 
from queen Catharine ; and these cir- 
cumstances operated, in concurrence 
■with the king's want of a supply and the 
people's desire to save their money, to 
forward a motion in parliament, that, in 
order to support the king's state, and 
supply his wants, all the religious houses 
might be conferred upon the crown, 
•which were not able to spend above 
200/. a year ; and an act was passed for 
that purpose, 27 Her, dVIII. c. 28. By 
this act about three hundred and eighty 
houses were dissolved, and a revenue of 
30,000/. or 32,000/. a year came to the 
crown ; besides about 100,000/. in plate 
and jewels. The suppression of these 
houses occasioned discontent, and at 
length an open rebellion : when this 
was appeased, the king resolved to sup- 
press the rest of the monasteries, and 
appointed a new visitation, which, caus- 
ed the greater abbeys to be suiifendered 
apace : and it was enacted by 31 Henry 
Vni. c. 13, that all monasteries which 
have been surrendered since the 4th of 
Fel^niary, in the twenty-seventh year 
of his majesty's reign, and which here- 
after shall be surrendered, shall be 
vested in the king. The knights of St. 
John of Jerusalem were also suppressed 
"bv the 32d Henry VIII, c. 24. The sup- 



pression of these greater houses by these 
two acts produced a revenue to the king 
of above 100,000/. a year, besides a large 
sum in plate and jewels. The last act 
of dissolution in this king's reign was the 
act of 37 Hen. VHI. c. 4, for dissolving 
colleges, free chapels, chantries, &amp;c. 
whicli act was farther enforced by 1 
Edw. VI. c. 14. By this act were sup- 
pressed 90 colleges, 110 hospitals, and 
2,374 chantries and free chapels. The 
number of houses and places suppressed 
from first to last, so far as any calcula- 
tions appear to have been made, seems 
to be as follows ;

we have the valuation.

Besides the friars' houses, and those sup- 
pressed by Wolsey, and many small 
houses of which we have no particular 
account. 

The sum total of the clear yearly re- 
venue of the several houses at the time 
of their dissolution, of which we have 
any account, seems to be as follows : 

Of the gi'eat monaste- 
ries, - - - /. 101,919 13 ;•;

houses in the country, 26 9 5 

Friars' houses of which 
we have the valuation, 751 2 



Total, /. 140,784 19 2 

If proper allowances are made for the 
lesser monasteries and houses not in- 
cluded in this estimate, and for the plate, 
&amp;c. which came into the hands of the 
king by the dissolution, and for the value 
of money at that time, which was at 
least six times as much as at present, 
and also consider that the estimate of 
the lands was generally supposed to be 
much under the real worth, we must 
conclude their whole revenues to have 
been immense. 

It does not appear -that any compu- 
tation hath been. made of the number of

persons contained in the religious 
houses. 

Those of the lesser monas- 
teries dissolved by 27 Hen.

about - . - - 10,000 

If we suppose the colleges 
and hospitals to have con- 
tained a proportionable

If we reckon the number in 
the greater monasteries ac- 
cording to the proportion 
of their revenues, they will 
be about 35,000 ; but as 
probably they had larger 
allowances in proportion to 
their number than those of 
the lesser monasteries, if 
-we abate upon that ac- 
count 5,000, they will then 
be 30,000 

One for each chantiy and 
free chapel - - - 2,374 



Total, 47,721 

But as there were probably more than 
one person to officiate in several of the 
free chapels, and there were other 
houses which are not included within 
this calculation, perhaps they may be 
computed in one general estimate at 
about 50,000. As there were pensions 
paid to almost all those of the greater 
monasteries, the king did not imme- 
diately come into the full enjoyment of 
their whole revenues ; however, by 
means of what he did receive, he found- 
ed six new bishoprics, viz. those of 
Westminster, (which was changed by 
queen Elizabeth into a deanery, with 
twelve prebends and a school,) Peter- 
borough, Chester, Gloucester, Bristol, 
and Oxford. And in eight other sees 
he founded deaneries and chapters, by 
converting the priors and monks into 
deans and prebendaries, viz. Canter- 
bury, Winchester, Durham, Worcester, 
Rochester, Norwich, Ely, and Carlisle. 
He founded also the colleges of Christ 
Church in Oxford, and Trinity in Cam- 
bridge, and finished King's College 
there. He likewise founded professor- 
ships of divinit\', law, physic, and of the 
Hebrew and Gi'eek tongues in both the 
said Universities. He gave the house 
of Grey Friars and St. Bartholomew's 
Hospital to the city of London, and a 
pei-petual pension to the poor knights 
of Windsor, and laid out great sums in 
building and fortifying many ports in the 
channel. It is observable, upon the 



whole, that the dissolution of these 
houses was not an act of the church, 
but of the state, in the period preceding 
the reformation, by a king and parlia- 
ment of the Roman Cathohc communion 
in all points, except the king's supre- 
macy ; to which the pope himself; by 
his bulls and licences, had led the way. 

As to the merits of these institutionSj 
authors are much divided. While some 
have considered them as beneficial to 
learning, piety, and benevolence, others 
have thought them very injurious. We 
may form some idea of them from the 
following remarks of Mr. Gilpin. 

He is speaking of Glastonbury Abbey, 
which possessed the amplest revenues 
of any religious house in England. "Its 
fraternity," says he, " is said to have 
consisted of five hundred established 
monks, besides nearly as many retain- 
ers on the abbey. Above four hundred 
children were not only educated in it, 
but entirely maintained. Strangei's 
from all parts of Europe were liberally 
received, classed according to their sex 
and nation, and might consider the hos- 
pitable roof under wliich they lodged as 
their own. Five hundred travellers, 
with their horses, have been lodged at 
once within its walls ; while the poor 
from every side of the country, Vi'aiting 
the ringing of the alms bell ; when they 
flocked in crowds, young and old, to the 
gate of the monastery, where they re- 
ceived, every morning, a plentiful pro- 
vision for themselves and their families : 
— all this appears great and noble. 

"On the other hand, when we con- 
sider five hundred persons bred up in 
indolence and lost to the common- 
wealth ; when we consider that these 
houses were the great nurseries of su- 
perstition, bigotry, and ignorance ; the 
stews of sloth, sicupidity, and perhaps 
intemperance ; Avhen we consider that 
the education received in them had not 
the least tincture of useful learning, good 
manners, or true religion, but tended 
rather to vilify and disgrace the human 
mind ; when we consider that the pil- 
gi-ims and strangers who resorted thi- 
ther were idle vagabonds, who got no- 
thing abroad that was equivalent to the 
occupattions they left at home ; and 
when A^ consider, lastly, that indis- 
criminate alms-giving is not real cha- 
rity, but an avocation from labour and 
industry, checking every idea of exer- 
tion, and filling the mind with abject 
notions, we are led to acquiesce in the 
fate of these foundations, and view their 
ruins, not only with a picturesque eye, 
but with moral and religious satisfaction.'*

MONASTIC, something belonejing 
to monks, or the monkish hfe. — The 
monastic profession is a kind of civil 
death, which in all worldly matters has 
the same effect with the natural death. 
The council of Trent, &amp;c. fix sixteen 
years the age at which a person may 
be admitted mto the monastical state. 

St. Anthony is the person who, in the 
fourth centuiy, first instituted the mo- 
nastic life ; as St. Pachomius, in the 
same century, is said to have first set 
on foot the ccenobite life, i. e. regular 
communities of religious. In a short 
time the deserts of Egypt became in- 
habited by a set of solitaries, who took 
upon them the monastic profession. St. 
Basil carried the monkish humour into 
the East, where he composed a rule 
which afterwards obtained through a 
great part of the West. 

In the eleventh century, the monastic 
discipline was grown very remiss. St. 
Oddo first began to retrieve it in the 
monastery of Cluny : that monastery, 
by the conditions of its erection, was 
put under the immediate protection of 
the holy see ; with a prohibition to all 
powers, both secular and ecclesiastical, 
to disturb the monks in the possession 
of their effects or the election of their 
abbot. In virtue hereof they pleaded 
an exemption from the jurisdiction of 
the bishop, and extended this privi- 
lege to all the houses dependent on 
Cluny. This made the first congrega- 
tion of several houses under one chief 
immediately subject to the pope, so as 
to constitute one body, or as they now 
call it, one religious order. Till then, 
each monastery was independent, and 
subject to the bishop. See Monk. 

MONK anciently denoted, " a person 
who retired from the world to give him- 
self wholly to God, and to live in soli- 
tude and abstinence." The word is de- 
rived from the Latin monachus, and 
that from the Greek novaxos, " solitary ;" 
of jiovos solus, " alone." 

The original of monks seems to have 
been this : The persecutions which at- 
tended the first ages of the Gospel 
forced some Christians to retire from 
the world, and live in deserts and places 
most private and unfrequented, in hopes 
of finding tliat peace and comfort among 
beasts, which were denied them among 
men ; and this being the case of some 
very extraordinary persons, their ex- 
ample gave such reputation to retire- 
ment, that the practice was continued 
when the reason of Its commencement 
ceased. After tbe empire became 



Christian, instances of this kind were 
numerous: and those whose security 
had obliged them to live separately and 
apart, became afterwards united into 
societies. V^'^e may also add, that the 
mystic theology, which gained ground 
towards the close of fiie third century, 
contributed to produce the same effect, 
and to drive men into solitude for the 
purposes of devotion. 

The monks, at least the ancient ones, 
were distingaiished into solitaries, c£no- 
bites, and sarabites. 

The solitaries are those who live alone, 
in places remote from all towns and ha- 
bitations of men, as do still some of the 
hermits. The c&lt;£nobites are those who 
live in community with several others 
in the same house, and under the same 
superiors. The sarabites were strolling 
monks, having no fixed rule or resi- 
dence. 

The houses of monks, again, were 
of two kinds, viz. mo7iasteries and 
lauree. 

Those who are now called monks, 
are coenobites, who live together in a 
convent or monastery, who make vows 
of living according to a certain i-ule es- 
tablished by the founder, and wear a 
habit which distinguishes their order. 

Those that are endowed, or have a 
fixed revenue, are most properly called 
monks, monachi; as the Chartrcux, Be- 
nedictines, Bernardines, &amp;c. The Men- 
dicants, or those that beg, as the Capu- 
chins and Franciscans, are more pro- 
perly called religious and //•ia?-s, though 
the names are frequently confounded. 

The first monks wei'e those of St. 
Anthony, who, towards the close of the 
fourth century, formed them into a 
regular body, engaged them to live in 
society with each other, and prescribed 
to them fixed rules for the direction of 
their conduct. These regulations, which 
Anthony had made in Egypt, were soon 
introduced into Palestine and Syria by 
his disciple Hilarion. Almost about 
the same time, Aones, or Eugenius, 
with their companions Gaddanas and 
Azyzas, instituted the monastic order 
in Mesopotamia, and the adjacent coun- 
tries ; and their example was followed 
with such rapid success, that in a short 
time the whole east was filled with a 
lazy set of mortals, who abandoning all 
human connexions, advantages, plea- 
sures, and concerns, wore out a languish- 
ing and misei-able existence amidst the 
hardships of want and various kinds of 
suffering, in order to arrive at a more 
close and rapturous communication with 
God and angels. 

From the East this gloomy disposi-

tiou passed into the West, and first in- 
to Italy and its neighbouring islands ; 
though it is uncertain who transplanted 
it thither. St. Martin, the celebrated 
bishop of Tours, erected the first mo- 
nasteries in Gaul, and recommended 
this religious solitude with such power 
and efficacy both by his instructions 
and his example, that his ftineral is said 
to have been attended by no less than 
two thousand monks. From hence the 
monastic discipline extended gradually 
its progress through the other provin- 
ces and countries of Europe. There 
were, besides the monks of St. Basil (call- 
ed in the East Colop;erj, fi-om xa\oj yjjwv, 
"a good old man,") and those of St. 
Jerome, the hermits of St. Augustine, 
and afterwards those of St. Benedict 
and St. Bernard : at length came tliose 
of St. Francis and St. Dominic, w'ith a 
legion of others ; all which see under 
their proper heads. 

Towards the close of the fifth centu- 
ry, the monks, who had formerly lived 
only for themselves in solitary retreats, 
and had never thought of' assuming 
any rank among the sacerdotal order, 
were now gradually distinguished from 
the populace, and endowed with such 
opulence and honourable privileges, 
that they found themselves in a condi- 
tion to claim an eminent station among 
the pillars and supporters of the Cb.ris- 
tian community. The fame of their 

giety and sanctity was so great, that 
ishops and presbyters were often cho- 
sen out of their order ; and the passion 
of erecting edifices and convents, in 
which the monks and holy virgins might 
serve God in the most commodious man- 
ner, was at this time carried beyond 
all bounds. Howe\ er, their licentious- 
ness, even in this century, was become 
a. proverb ; and they are said to have 
excited the most dreadful tumults and 
seditions in various places. The mo- 
nastic orders were at first under the im- 
mediate jurisdiction of the bishops, from 
which they were exempted by the Ro- 
man pontiff about the end of the seventh 
century ; and the monks, in retuni, de- 
voted themselves wholly to advance the 
interests and to maintain the dignitv of 
the bishop of Rom?. This immunitv 
which they obtained was a fruitful 
source of licentiousness and disorder, 
and occasioned the greatest part of the 
vices with which they were afterwards 
so justly charged. In the eighth cen- 
tury the monastic discipline was ex- 
tremely relaxed, both in the eastern 
and western provinces, and all efforts to 
restore it were ineffectual. Ne\erthe- 
le-fs, this kind of institution was in the 



highest esteem ; and nothing could equal 
the veneration that was paid about the 
close of the ninth century to such as de- 
voted themselves to the sacred gloom 
and indolence of a convent. This ve- 
neration caused several kings and em- 
pei'ors to call them to their courts, and 
to employ them in civil affairs of the 
greatest moment. Their reformation 
was attempted by Louis the Meek, but 
the effect was of short duration. In the 
eleventh century they were exempted 
by the popes from the authority es- 
tablished ; insomuch, that in the council 
of Lateran that was held in the year 
1215, a decree was passed, by the ad- 
vice of Innocent III. to prevent any 
new monastic institutioi^.s ; and several 
were entirely suppressed. In the fif- 
teenth and sixteenth centuries, it ap- 
pears, from the testimony of the best 
writers, that the monks were generally 
lazy, illiterate, profligate, and licentious 
epicures, whose views in life were con- 
fined to opulence, idleness, and plea- 
sure. However, the reformation had a 
manifest influence in restraining their 
excesses, and rendering them more 
circumspect and cautious in their ex- 
ternal conduct. 

Monks are distinguished by the co- 
lour of their habits into black, white, 
grnj, &amp;c. Among the monks, some are 
called monks of the choir, others Jiro- 
fessed ?nonks, and others lay monks; 
which last are destined for the service 
of the convent, and have neither cleri- 
cate nor literature. 

Cloistered monks are those who ac- 
tually reside in the house : in opposition 
to extra monks, who ha^'e benefices de- 
pending on the monastery. 

Monks are also distinguished into re- 
formed, whom the civil and ecclesiasti- 
cal authority have made masters of an- 
cient converts, and put in their power 
to retrieve the ancient discipline, which 
had been relaxed : and ancient, who re- 
main in the convent, to live in it ac- 
cording to its establishment at the 
time when they made their vows, with- 
out obliging themselves to any new re- 
form. 

Anciently the monks were all laymen, 
and were only distinguished from the 
rest of the people by a peculiar habit, 
and an exti'aordinary devotion. Not 
only the monks were pi'ohibited the 
priesthood, but even priests were ex- 
pressly pi'ohibited from becoming 
monks, as appears from the letters of 
St. Gregory. Pope Siricius was the first 
who called them to the clericate, on 
occasion of some great scarcity of priests 
that the church was then supposed to

MONOPHYSITES, (from uovw, so- 
lus, and (pucriJ natura,) a general name 
given to all those sectaries in the Le- 
vant, who only own one nature in Jesus 
Christ ; and who maintain that the di- 
vine and human nature of Jesus Christ 
were so united as to form only one na- 
ture, yet without any change, confusion, 
or mixture of the two natures. 

The Monophysites, however, pro- 
perly so called, are the followers of 
beverus, a learned monk of Palestine, 
who was created patriarch of Antioch, 
in 513, and Petrus Fullensis. 

The Monophysites were encouraged 
by the emperor Anastasius, but .sup- 
pressed by Justin and succeeding .em- 
Eerors. However, this sect was restored 
y Jacob Baradsus, an obsciu'e monk, 
insomuch that when he died bishop of 
Edessa, A. D. 588, he left it in a most 
flourishing state in Syria, Mesopotamia, 
Armenia, Egypt, Nubia, Abyssmia, and 
other countries. The laborious efforts 
of Jacob were seconded in Egypt and 
the adjacent countries by Theodosius, 
bishop of Alexandria ; and he became 
so famous, that all the Monophysites of 
the East considered him as their second 
parent and founder, and are to this day 
called Jacobites, in honour of their new 
chief. The Monophysites are divided 
into two sects or parties, the one Afri- 
can and the other Asiatic ; at the head 
of the latter is the patriarch of Antioch, 
who resides for the most part in the mo- 
nastery of St. Athanias, near the city of 
Merdin : the former are under the ju- 
risdiction of the patriarch of Alexandria, 
who generally resides at Grand Cairo, 
and are subdivided into Cophts and 
Abyssinians. From the fifteenth cen- 
tury downwards, all the patriarchs 
of the Monophysites have taken the 
name of Ignatius, in order to show that 
they are the lineal successors of Igna- 
tius, svho was bishop of Antioch in the 
first century, and consequently the law- 
ful patriarch of Antioch. In the se- 
venteenth century, a small body of Mo- 
nophysites, in Asia, abandoned for some 
time the doctrine and institution of their 
ancestors, and embraced the communion 
of Rome ; but the African Monophy- 
sites, notwithstanding that poverty and 
ignorance which exposed them to the 
seductions of sophistry and gain, stood 
firm in their principles, and made an 
obstinate resistance to the promises. 



presents, and attempts employed by the 
papal missionaries to bring them under 
the Roman yoke : and in the eighteenth 
century, those of Asia and Africa have 
persisted in their refusal to enter into 
the communion of the Romish church, 
notwithstanding the earnest entreaties 
and alluring offers that have been made 
from time to time by the pope's legates, 
to conquer their inflexible constancy. 

MONOTHELITES, (compounded 
of fiovos " single," and S-arifia, 5£\w, volo, 
" I will,") an ancient sect which sprung 
out of the Eutychians; thus called, as 
onlv allowing ot one will in Jesus Christ. 

The opinion of the Monothelites had 
its rise in 930, and had the emperor 
Heraclius for an adherent : it was the 
same with that of the acephalous Seve- 
rians. — ^They allowed of two wills in 
Christ, considered with regard to the 
two natures ; but reduced them to one, 
by reason of the union of the two na- 
tures, thinking it absurd that there 
should be two free wills in one and the 
same person. They were condemned 
by the sixth general council in 680, as 
being supposed to destroy the perfection 
of the humanity of Jesus Christ, de- 
priving it of will and operation. Their 
sentiments were afterwai'ds embraced 
by the Maronites. 

MONTANISTS, a sect which sprung 
up about the year 171, in the reign of 
the emperor Marcus Aurelius. They 
were so called from their leader Mon- 
tanus, a Phrygian by birth : whence 
they are sometimes called Phrygians 
and Catafihrygians. 

Montanus, it is said, embraced Chris- 
tianity in hopes of rising to the digni- 
ties of the church. He pretended to 
inspiration ; and gave out that the Holy 
Ghost had instructed him in several 
points which had not been revealed to 
the apostles. Priscilla and Maximilla, 
two enthusiastic women of Phrygia, 
presently became his disciples, and in a 
short time he had a great number of 
followers. The bishops of Asia, being 
assembled together, condemned his 
prophecies, and excommunicated those 
that dispersed them. Afterwards they 
wrote an account of what had passed to 
the western churches, where the pre- 
tended prophecies of Montanus and his 
followers were likewise condemned. 

The Montanists, finding themselves 
exposed to the censure of the whole 
church, formed a schism, and set up a 
distinct society under the direction of 
those who called themselves firofihets. 
— Montanus, in conjunction with Pris- 
cilla and Maximilla, were at the head 
of the sect.

These sectaries made no alteration 
in the creed. They only held that the 
Holy Spirit made Montanus his organ 
for delivering a more perfect form of 
discipline than what was delivered by 
his apostles. They refused communion 
for ever to those who were guilty of 
notorious crimes, and believed that the 
bishops had no authority to reconcile 
them. They held it unlawful to fly in 
time of persecution. They condemned 
second marriages, allowed the dissolu- 
tion of marriage, and observed three 
lents.

conduct of life, or that which deter- 
mines an action to be good or virtuous. 
— 2. A moral agent is a being that is

be denominated good or evil in a moral

we call good or virtuous : some call this

MORALITY is that relation or pro- 
portion which actions bear to a given 
mle. It is generally used in reference 
to a good life. Morality is distinguished 
from religion thus: "Religion is a stu- 
dious conformity of our actions to the 
relations in which we stand to each 
other in civil society. Morality compre- 
hends only a part of religion ; but reli- 
gion comprehends the whole of morali- 
ty. Morality finds all her motives here 
below ; religion fetches all her motives 
from above. The highest principle in 
morals is a just regard to the rights of 
men ; the first principle in religion is 
the love of God." The various duties 
of morality are considered in their rc;- 
spective places in this work. See Bisliofi

MORAVIANS, a sect generally said 
to have ansen under Nicholas Lewis, 
count of Zinzendorf, a German noble- 
man of the last century, and thus called 
because the first converts to their sys- 
tem were some Moravian families. Ac- 
cording to the society's own account, 
howe\ er, they derive their origin from 
the Greek church in the ninth century, 
when, by the instrumentality of Me- 
thodius and Cyrillus, two Greek monks, 
the kings of Bulgaria and Moravia be- 
ing converted to the faith, were, to- 
gether with their subjects, united in 
communion with the Greek church. 
Methodius was their first bishop, and 
for their use Cyrillus translated the 
Scriptures into the Sclavonian language. 
The antipathy of the Greek and Ro- 
man churches is well known, and by 
much the greater part of the Brethren 
were in process of time compelled, after 
\\ many struggles, to submit to the see of 
i Rome. A few, however, adhering to 
!] the rites of their mother church, united 
j themselves in 1170 to the Waldenses, 
ii and sent missionaries into many coun- 
;j tries. In 1547 they were called Fratres 
I Irgis Christi, or Brethren of the Law of 
j} Christ ; because, about that period, they 
I had thrown off all reverence for human 
jj compilations of the faith, professing 
i| simply to follow the doctrines and / pre- 
j cepts contained in the word of God. 
I There being at this time no bishops 
jl in the Bohemian church who had not 
submitted to the papal jurisdiction, three 
priests of the society of United Breth- 
ren were, about the year 1467, conse- 
crated by Stephen, bishop of the Wal- 
denses, in Austria, (see Waldenses ;) 
and these prelates, on their return to 
their own country, consecrated ten co- 
bishops, or co-seniors, from among the 
rest of the presbyters. In 1523, the 
United Brethren commenced a friendly 
correspondence, first with Luther, and 
afterwards with Calvin and other lead- 
ers among the reformers. A persecu- 
tion, which was brought upon them on 
this account, and some religious disputes 
which took place among themselves, 
threatened for a while the society with 
ruin; but the disputes were, in 1570, 
put an end to by a synod, which decreed 
that differences about non-essentials

should not destroy their union ; and the 

tersecution ceased in 1575, wheTi the 
Tnited Brethren obtained an edict for 
the pubhc exercise of their religion. 
This toleration was renewed in 1609, 
and liberty granted them to erect new 
churches. But a civil war, which, in 
1612, broke out in Bohemia, and a vio- 
lent persecution which followed it in 
1621, occasioned the dispersion of their 
ministers, and brought great distress 
upon the Brethren in general. Some 
of them fled to England, otliers to 
Saxony and.Brandenburg ; whilst many, 
overcome by the severity of the perse- 
cution, conformed to the rites of the 
church of Rome. One colony of these, 
who retained in purity their original 
principles and practice, was, in 1722, 
conducted by a brother, named Chris- 
tian David, fi'om Fulneck, in Moravia, 
to Upper Lusatia, where they put 
themselves under the protection of Ni- 
cholas Lewis, count of Zinzendorf, and 
built a village on his estate at the foot 
of a hill, called Hutberg, or Watch 
Hill. The count, who, soon after their 
arrival, removed from Dresden to his 
estate in the country, shov/ed every 
mark of kindness to the poor emigrants ; 
but being a zealous member of the 
church established by law, he endea- 
voured for some time to prevail upon 
them to unite themselves with it, by 
adopting the Lutheran faith and disci- 
pline. This they declined ; and the 
count, on a more minute inquiry into 
their ancient history and distinguishing 
tenets, not only desisted from his first 
purpose, but became himself a convert 
to the faith and discipline of the United 
Brethren. 

The synod which, in 1570, put an end 
to the disputes which then tore the 
church of the Brethren into factions, 
had considered as non-essentials the 
distinguishing tenets of their own society, 
of the Lutherans, and of the Calvinists. 
In consequence of this, many of the re- 
formers of both these sects had follow- 
ed the Brethren to Herrahut, and been 
received by them into communion; but 
not being endued with the peaceable 
spirit of the church which they had 
joined, they started disputes among 
themselves, which threatened the de- 
struction of the whole establishment. 
By the indefatigable exertions of count 
Zinzendorf these disputes were allayed ; 
and statutes, being, in 1727, drawn up 
and agreed to for the regulation both of 
the internal and of the external con- 
cerns of the congregation, bi-otherly 
love and union was again established ; 
and no schism whatever, in point of 



doctrine, has since that period disturbed 
the church of the United Brethren. 

In 1735, the count, who, under God, 
had been the instrument of renewing 
the Brethren's church, was consecrated 
one of their bishops, having the year 
before been examined and i-eceived into 
the clerical order by the Theological 
Faculty of Tubingen. Dr. Potter, then 
archbishop of Canterbui'y, congratula- 
ted him upon this event, and promised 
his assistance to a church of confessors, 
of whom he wrote in terms of the 
highest respect, for their having main- 
tained the pure and primitive faith and 
discipline in the midst of the most te- 
dious and cruel persecutions. That his 
Grace, who had studied the various 
controversies about church-government 
with uncommon success, admitted the 
Moravian episcopal succession, we 
know from the most unquestionable au- 
thority ; for he communicated his senti- 
ments on the subject to Dr. Seeker, 
wi^'le bishop of Oxford. In conformity 
witn these sentiments of the arch-bi- 
shop, we are assured that the parlia- 
ment of Great-Britain, after mature in- 
vestigation, acknowledged the Unitas 
Fratrum to be a Protestant episcopal 
church ; and in 1794 an act was cer- 
tainly passed in their favour. 

This sect, like many others, has been 
shamefully misrepresented, and things 
laid to their charge of which they never 
were guilty. It must, however, be ac- 
knowledged, that some of their converts 
having previously imbibed extravagant 
notions, propagated them with zeal 
among tiieir new friends in a phraseo- 
logy extremely reprehensible ; and that 
count Zinzendorf himself sometimes 
adopted the very improper language of 
those fanatics, whom he wished to re- 
claim from their errors to the sober- 
ness of truth ; but much of the extrava- 
gance and absurdity which has been 
attributed to the count is not to be 
charged to him, but to those persons 
who, writing his extempore sermons in 
short hand, printed and published them 
without his knowledge or consent. 

This eminent benefactor to the United 
Brethren died in 1760, and it is with 
reason that they honour his memory as 
having been the instrument by which 
God restored and built up their church. 
But they do not regard him as their 
head, nor take his writings, nor the 
writings of any other man, as the stand- 
ard of their doctrines, which they pro- 
fess to derive immediately from the 
word of God. 

It has been already observed, that the 
church of the United Brethren is epis- 



MOR 



392 



MOR 



copal ; but though they consider episco- 
pal ordination as necessary to qualify the 
servants of the church for their respec- 
tive functions, they allow to their bi- 
shops no elevation of rank or pre-emi- 
nent authority; their church having 
from its first establishment been go- 
verned by synods, consisting of deputies 
from all the congregations, and by other 
subordinate bodies, which they call Con- 
ferences. The synods, which are ge- 
nerally held once in seven years, are 
called together by the elders who were 
in the former synod appointed to super- 
intend the whole unity. In the first sit- 
ting a president is chosen, and tliese el- 
ders lay down their office ; but they do 
not withdraw from the assembly ; for 
they, together with all bishops, sejiiores 
civi/es, or lay elders, and those ministers 
who have the genei'al care or inspection 
of several congregations in one province, 
have seats in the synod without any par- 
ticular election. The other members 
are, one or more deputies sent by each 
congregation, and such ministers or nus- 
sionaries as are particularly called to 
attend. Women, approved by the con- 
gregations are also admitted as hear- 
ers, and are called upon to give their 
advice in what relates to the ministe- 
rial labour among their sex ; but they 
have no decisive vote in the synod. The 
votes of all the other memljers are 
equal. 

In questions of importance, or of 
which the consequences cannot be fore- 
seen, neither the majority of votes nor 
the unanimous consent of all present can 
decide ; but recourse is had to the lot. 
For adopting this unusual mode of de- 
ciding in ecclesiastical affairs, the Breth- 
ren allege as reasons the practices of 
the ancient Jews and the apostles ; the 
insufficiency of the human understanding 
amidst the best and purest intentions to 
decide for itself in what concerns the 
administration of Christ's Kingdom ; and 
their own confident reliance on the 
comfortable pi-omises that the Lord Je- 
sus will approve himself the head and 
ruler of his church. The lot is never 
made use of but after mature delibera- 
tion and fervent prayer; nor is any 
thing submitted to its decision which 
does not, after being thoroughly weigh- 
ed, appear to the assembly eligible in 
itself. 

In every synod the inward and out- 
ward state of the unity, and the con- 
cerns of the congregations and missions, 
are taken into consideration. If errors 
in doctrine or deviations in practice 
have crept in, the synod endeavours not 
only to remove them, but, by salutary 



regulations, to prevent them for the fu- 
ture. It considers how many bishops 
are to be consecrated to fill up the va- 
cancies occasioned by death ; and every 
member of the synod gives his vote for 
such of the clergy as he thinks best 
qualified. Those who iiave the ma- 
jority of votes are taken into the lot, and 
they who are approved are consecrated 
accordingly ; but, by consecration, they 
are vested with no superiority over 
their brethren, since it behoves him 
who is the greatest to be the servant of 
all. 

Towards the conclusion of every sy- 
nod a kind of executive board is chosen, 
and called IVie Elders^ Conference of the 
Unity. At present it consists of thir- 
teen elders, and is divided into four com- 
mittees, or departments. — 1. The Mis- 
sions' department, which superintends 
all the concerns of the missions into 
Heathen countries. — 2. The Hel/iers' 
depaitment, which watches over the 
purity of doctrine, and tlie moral con- 
duct of the different congregations. — 3. 
The Serx&lt;ants' department, to which the 
economical concerns of the Unity are 
committed. — 4. The Overseers' depart- 
ment, of which the business is to see 
that the constitution and discipline of 
the brethren be every where main- 
tained. No resolution, however, of any 
of these departments has the smallest 
force till it be laid before the assembly 
of the whole Elders'' Conference, and 
have the approbation of that body. The 
powers of the Elders' Confereiice ai'e, 
mdeed, very extensive : besides the ge- 
neral care which it is commissioned by 
the synods to take of all the congrega- 
tions and missions, it appoints and re- 
moves every servant in the Unity, as 
circumstances may require ; authorizes 
the bishops to ordain presbyters or dea- 
cons, and to consecrate other bishops ; 
and, in a word, though it cannot abro- 
gate any of the constitutions of the sy- 
nod, or enact new ones itself, it is pos- 
sessed of the supreme executive power 
over the whole body of the United. 
Brethren. 

Besides this general Conference of El- 
ders, which superintends the affairs of 
the whole Unity, there is anotlier Con- 
ference of elders belonging to each con- 
gregation, which directs its affairs, and 
to which the bishops and all other mi- 
nisters, as v/ell as the lay members of 
the congregation, are subject. This 
body, which is called the Elders' _ Con- 
ference of the Congregations, consists, 1. 
Of the Minister, as president, to whom 
the ordinary care of the congregation is 
committed, except when it is very nu-

merous, and then the general inspection 
of it is intrusted to a separate person, 
called the Congregation Helfier. — 2. Of 
the Warden, whose office it is to super- 
intend ; with the aid of his council, all 
outward concerns of the congregation, 
and to assist every individual with his 
advice. — 3. Of a Married Pair, who 
care particularly for the spiritual wel- 
fare of the married people. — 4. Of a 
Single Clergyman, to whose care the 
)-oung men are more particularly com- 
mitted. — And, 5. Of those IVomen who 
assist in caring for the spiritual and 
temporal welfare of their own sex, and 
who in this conference '- ave equal votes 
with the men. As the Elders Confer- 
ence of each Congregation is answerable 
for its proceedings to the Elders' Confer- 
ence of the Unity, visitations from the 
latter to the former are held from time 
to time, that the affairs of each congre- 
gation, and the conduct of its imme- 
diate governors, may be intimately 
known to the supreme executive go- 
vernment of the whole church. 

In their opinion, episcopal consecra- 
tion does not confer any power to pre- 
side over one or more congregations ; 
and a bishop can discharge no office but 
by the appointment of a synod, or of the 
Elders' Conference of the Unity. Pres- 
byters among them can perform every 
function of the bishop, except ordination. 
Deacons are assistants to the Pi'esby- 
ters, much in the same way as in the 
Church of England; and in the Breth- 
ren's churches, deaconesses are retain- 
ed for the purpose of privately admon- 
ishing their own sex, and visiting them 
in tlieir sickness ; but though they are 
solemnly blessed to this office, they are 
not permitted to teach in public, and far 
less to administer the sacraments. They 
have likewise se?iiores civiles, or lay el- 
ders, in contradistinction to spiritual 
elders, or bishops, who are appointed to 
watch over the constitution and disci- 
pline of the Unity of the Brethren, over 
the observance of the laws of the coun- 
ti*y in which congregations or missions 
are established, and over the privileges 
granted to the Brethren by the govern- 
ments under which they live. They 
have economies, or choir houses, where 
they live together in community : the 
single men and single women, widows 
and widowers, apart, each under the 
superintendence of elderly persons of 
their own class. In these houses every 
person who is able, and has not an in- 
dependent support, labours in their own 
occupation, and contributes a stipulated 
sum for their maintenance. Their chil- 
dren are educated vrith peculiar care ; 



their subjection to their superiors and 
elders is singular, and appears parti- 
cularly striking in their missions and 
marriages. In the former, those who 
have offered themselves on the service, 
and are approved as candidates, wait 
their several calls, referring themselves 
entirely to the decision of the lot ; and, 
it is said, never hesitate when that hath 
decided the place of their destination. 
(See above.) In marriage, they may 
only form a connexion with those of 
tlieir own communion. The brother 
who marries out of the congregations is 
immediately cut off from church fellow- 
ship. Sometimes a sister, by express 
licence from the Elders' Conference, is 
permitted to marry a person of approved 
piety in another communion, yet still to 
join in their church ordinances as be- 
fore. A brother may make his own choice 
of a partner in the society ; but as all in- 
tercourse between the different sexes is 
carefully avoided, very few opportuni- 
ties of forming particular attachments 
are found, and they usually rather refer 
their choice to the church than decide 
for themselves. And as the lot must be 
cast to sanction their union, each re- 
ceives his partner as a divine appoint- 
ment ; and, however strange this me- 
thod may appear to those who consult 
only their passions or their interest, it 
is observable, that no where fewer un- 
happy marriages are found than among 
the Brethren. But what characterises 
the Moravians most, and holds them up 
to the attention of others, is their mis- 
sionary zeal. In this they are superior 
to any other body of people in the world. 
" Their missionaries," as one observes, 
" are all of them volunteers ; for it is 
an inviolable maxim with them to per- 
suade no man to engage in missions. 
They are all of one mind as to the doc- 
trines they teach, and seldom make an 
attempt where there are not half a 
dozen of them in the mission. Their 
zeal is calm, steady, persevering. They 
would reform the world, but are care- 
ful how they quaiTel with it. They car- 
ry their point by address, and the in- 
sinuations of modesty and mildness, 
which commisnd them to all men, and 
give offence to none. The habits of si- 
lence, quietness, and decent resen'e, 
mark their character. If any of their 
missionaries are can'ied off by sickness 
or casualty, men of the same stamp are 
ready to supply their place." 

As they stand first on the list of those 
who have engaged in missionary ex- 
ertions, we shall here insert a fartlier 
account of them and their missions, with 
which I have been favoured by a most

MOR

MOR 



respectable clergyman of their dtiiomi- ] 
nation : " When brethren or sisters find | 
themselves disposed to serve God among 
the heathen, they communicate their 
wishes and views to the committee ap- 
pointed by the synods of the brethren to 
superintend the missions, in a confiden- 
tial letter. If on particular inquiry into 
their circumstances and connexions no 
objection is found, they are considered 
as candidates. As to mental qualifica- 
tions, much erudition is not requited by 
the brethren. To be well versed in the 
sacred Scriptures, and to have an ex- 
perimental knowledge of the truths they 
contain, is judged indispensably ne- 
cessary. And it has been found by ex- 
f&gt;erience, that a good understanding 
joined to a friendly disposition, and, 
above all, a heart filled with the love of 
God, are the best and the only essential 
qualifications of a missionaiy. Nor are 
in general the habits of a student so well 
calculated to form his body for a labo- 
rious life as those of a mechanic. Yet 
men of learning are not excluded, and 
their gifts have been made useful in va- 
rious ways. When vacancies occur, or 
new missions are to be begun, the list 
of candidates is examined ; and those 
who appear suitable are called upon, 
and accept or decline the call as they 
find themselves disposed." 

" The following are the names of the 
settlements of the United Brethren in 
heathen countries. 

" Begun in 1732, in the Danish West 
India Islands. In St. Thomas; New 
Herrnhut, Nisky. In St. Croix; Fried- 
ensberg, Friedensthal. In St. Jan; 
Bethany, Em maus. — Tn 173.": In Green- 
land ; ' New Herrnhut, Litchenfels 
l^ichtenau. — 1734 : In .Xorth America ; 
Faiiifield, in Upper Canada, Goshen on 
the river Muskingum. — In 1736: At the 
Cafie of Good Hope; Bavians Kloof 
(renewed in 1792.) — In 1738 : In South 
America; among the, negro slaves at 
Paramaribo and Sommelsdyk ; among 
the free negroes at Bambey, on the Sa- 
rameca; among the native Indians at 
Hope, on the river Corentyn. — In 1754: 
In Jamaica ; two settlements in St. 
Elizabeth's parish. — In 1756 : In An- 
tigua; at St. John'.s, Grace Hill, Grace 
Bay. — In 1760: Near Tranguebar, in 
the East Indies ; Brethren's Garden. 
— In 1764 : On the Coast of Labrador; 
Naui, Okkak, Hopedale. — In 1765 : In 
Barbadoes; Sharon, near Bridgetown. 
— In 1765 : Irt the Russian fiart of Asia ; 
Sarepta. — In 1775 : In St. Kitt's ; at 
Basseterre.— In 1789 : In Tobago ; Sig- 
nal Hill (renewed in 1798.) 
" The Brethren had three flourishing 



settlements on the river Muskingum, 
Salem, Gnadenhuetten, and Schoen- 
bruna, before the late American war, 
during which these places were destroy- 
ed, and the inhabitants partly murder- 
ed, partly dispersed. The settlement 
Fairfield, in Canada, was made by those 
of the Indian converts, who were again 
collected by the missionaries. In 1798, 
a colony of Christian Indians went fi-om 
thence to take possession of their for- 
mer settlements on the Muskingum, 
which have been given to tliem by an 
act of congress, and built a new town, 
called Goshen. Part of the Indian con- 
gregation will fo(emain at Fairfield, in 
Canada, as a good seed ; our missiona- 
ries entertaining hopes that the Gospel 
may yet find entrance among the wild 
Chippeway tribe inhabiting those parts. 
" The Mission among the Hottentots 
at the Cape of Good Hope was begun in 
1736, by George Schmidt, a man of re- 
markable zeal and courage, who la- 
boured successfully among these peo- 
ple, till he had formed a small congre- 
gation of believers, whom he left to the 
care of a pious man, and went to Eu- 
rope with a view to represent the pro- 
mising state of the mission, and to re- 
turn with assistants. But, to his inex- 
pressible grief and disappointment, he 
was not permitted by the Dutch East 
India Company to resume his laboui's; 
some ignorant people having insinuated 
that the propagation of Christianity 
among the Hottentots would injure the 
interests of the colony. — Since that time 
to the year 1792 the brethren did nqt 
cease to make application to the Dutch 
government for leave to send missiona- 
ries to the Cape, especially as they 
heard that the small Hottentot congre- 
gation had kept together for some time, 
in earnest expectation of the return of 
their beloved teacher. He had taught 
some of them to read, and had left a 
Dutch Bible with them, which they used 
to read together for their edification. 
At length, in 1792, by the mercv of God, 
and the kind interference of friends in 
the Dutch government, the opposition 
of evil-minded people was over-ruled, 
and leave granted to send out three mis- 
sionaries, who, on their arrival, were 
willing, at the desire of the governor, to 
go first to Bavians Kloof, about one hun- 
dred and sixty English miles east from 
Capetown, and there to commence their 
labours on the spot where George 
Schmidt had resided. Their instruc- 
tions from the government in Holland 
granted them leave to choose the place 
of their residence, wherever they might 
find it most convenient; but the circum- 



MOR 



395 



MOR 



stances of the colony at that time would 
not admit of it. Since the English 
have made themselves masters of that 
country, they have built a new chapel ; 
and from the fa\'our and protection 
which the British government has uni- 
formly granted to the brethren's mis- 
sions, we have the best hopes that they 
will remain undisturbed and protected 
in their civil and religious liberty. The 
late Dutch government at the Cape de- 
serve also our warmest thanks tor the 
kind manner in which they received 
and protected the missionaries, pro- 
moting the views of the mission to the 
utmost of their power. 

" When the rtiissionaries fii-st arrived 
at Bavians Kloof, in 1792, it was a bar- 
ren, uninhabited place. There are at 
present [1811] twelve missionaries re- 
siding there and in the neighbourhood, 
and about 1000 Hottentots. 

"The settlement near Tranquebar, 
on the coast of Coromandel, was made 
in the year 1760, at the desire of the 
Danish government, chiefly with a view 
to bring the Gospel to the nihabitants of 
the Nicobar islands. After a perse- 
vering but fruitless attempt to form an 
establishment at Nancawery, one of the 
Nicobar islands, for that purpose, the 
whole plan was defeated by the follow- 
ing circumstances: The Danish go- 
vernment, finding the advantage gained 
by their settlements on these islands not 
to answer the great expense attending 
it, withdrew the people, who had al- 
ready suffered, greatly by the unwhole- 
someness of the climate ; and the Bre- 
thren residing there being left alone, and 
all communication cut off between!, ran- 
quebar and the Nicobar islands, it be- 
came necessary to purchase a vessel to 
convey provisions and other necessaries 
to the missionaries. This was done with 
great expense and hazard for some 
years, when, in the Amei-ican war, the 
vessel was taken by a French cniiser, 
though belonging to a neutral state. No 
redress could be obtained from the 
French, and the Brethren at Tranque- 
bar were obliged immediately to pro- 
cure another vessel, lest the missiona- 
ries at Nancawery should be left desti- 
tute. The enormous expense and loss 
incurred by these evc-.s, and the sickly 
State of the missionaries, made it ne- 
cessary to recall them : and thus not 
only the mission in these islands, but the 
first aim of the Brethren's settling in the 
East Indies, was frustrated. Since that 
time, no success has attended the mis- 
sion near Tranquebar. Some brethren, 
indeed, went to Serampore and Patna, 
where they resided for a time, watching 



an opportunity to serve the cause of 
God in those places ; but various cir- 
cumstances occasioned both these set- 
tlements to be relinquished. By a late 
resolution, the East India mission will 
be suspended for the present, the fex- 
penses attending it havmg of late years 
far exceeded our ability. 

" Serepta, near Czarizin, on the Wol- 
ga, in Russian Asia, was built chiefly 
with a viev/ to bring the Gospel to the 
Calmuck Tartars, and other Heathen 
tribes in those vast regions, among 
whom an opening might be found. 
Hitherto but little success has attended 
the Brethren's labours, though their ex- 
ertions have been gi-eat and persevering, 
and equal to those of any of our mis- 
sionaries in other countries. Some 
Brethren even resided for a considerable 
time among the Calmucks, conforming 
to their manner of living in tents, and 
accompanying them wherever they 
moved their camp in the Stefipe (im- 
mense plains covered with long grass.) 
They omitted no opportunity of preach- 
ing to them Jesus, and directing them, 
from their numberless idols and wretch- 
ed superstitions, to the only tnie God, 
and the only way of life and happiness ; 
but though they were heard and treated 
with civility, little impression could be 
made upon the hearts of these Heathen. 
Four Kirgess Tartar gii'ls, who hud 
been ransomed and educated by the 
Brethren, have been baptized. These, 
and one Calmuck woman, have as yet 
been all the fruits of this mission. The 
greatest part of the Calmucks have 
quitted those jjarts. The Brethren, 
however, have been visited by the Ger- 
man colonists living on the Wolga ; and, 
through God's blessing, societies have 
been formed, and ministers of the Gos- 
pel provided for most of the colonies by 
their instrumentality. Thus the mis- 
sion has answered a very beneficial 
purpose. 

"The most flourishing missions at 
present are those in Greenland, Anti- 
gua, St. Kitt's, the Danish West India 
islands, and the Cape of Good Hope. A 
new awakening has appeared of late 
among the Arawacks and free negroes 
in South America, the Esquimaux on 
the coast of Labrador, and in Bar- 
badoes ; and the latest accounts give 
us the most pleasing hopes of success 
in those parts. In Jamaica the pro- 
gress of the missions has been slow. 
However, of late, some of the most con- 
siderable planters in that island, being 
convinced of the utility of the mission, 
generously undertook to provide for the 
support of more missionaries, and mea- 



MOR

MOR 



sures have been adopted accordingly, 
to which we humbly trust, the Lord will 
give success in due time. Several at- 
tempts to carry the Gospel into other 
parts of the earth made by the Bre- 
thren ha\"e not succeeded. In 1735, mis- 
sionaries were sent to the Laplanders 
and Samojedes ; in 1737, and again in 
1768, to the coast of Guinea ; in 1738, 
to the negroes in Georgia ; in 1739, to 
the slaves in Algiers ; in 1740, to Cey- 
lon ; in 1747, to Persia ; m 1752, to 
Egypt ; of which we omit any particu- 
lar account, for brevity's sake. In upper 
Egypt there was a prospect of their be- 
ing useful among the Copts, who were 
visited for many years. 

" A society for the furtherance of the 
Gospel among the Heathen was insti- 
tuted by tlie Brethren in London as early 
as the year 1751, for the more effectual 
co-operation with and assistance of the 
said missions' department, in caring for 
those missionaries who might pass 
through London to their several posts. 
The society was, after some interruption 
in their meetings, renewed in 1766, and 
took the whole charge of the mission on 
the coast of Labrador upon themselves ; 
besides continuing to assist the other 
missions as much as lay in their power, 
especially those in the British dominions. 
As no regular communication was kept 
up with the coast of Labrador by go- 
vernment, a small vessel was employed 
to convey the necessaries of life to the 
missionaries once a year ; and here we 
cannot help observing, with thanks to 
God, that upwards of twenty years have 
now elapsed, during which, by his gra- 
cious preservation, no disaster has be- 
fallen the vessel, so as to interrupt a 
regular annual communication, though 
the coast is very rocky and full of ice, 
and the whole navigation of the most 
dangerous kind. 

" in Amsterdam a similar society was 
established bv the Brethren in 1746, and 
renewed in 1793, at Zeistnear Utrecht. 
This society took particular chai'ge of 
the mission at the Cape of Good Hope ; 
but the late troubles in Holland have 
rendered them unable to lend much as- 
sistance for the present. The Brethren 
in North America established a socie- 
ty for propagating the Gospel among 
the Heathen in the year 1787, which 
was incorporated by the State of Penn- 
sylvania, and has been very active in as- 
sisting the missions among the Indians. 
These three societies do all in their 
power to help to support the great and 
accumulated burdens of the above- 
mentioned missions' department, and 
God has laid a blessing upon their ex- 



ertions. But they have no power to be* 
gin new missions, or to send out mis- 
sionaries, which, by the synods of the 
Brethren's church, is vested solely in the 
Elders' Conference of the Unity." 

The number of converts and persons 
under instruction in the different mis- 
sions amount to about 55,150, and the 
numbei' of missionaries about 163. 

As to the tenets of the Moravians, 
though they acknowledge no other 
standard of truth than the sacred Scrip- 
tures, they adhei'e to the Augsburg con- 
fession [see that article.] They pro- 
fess to believe that the kingdom of 
Christ is not confined t,o any particular 
party, community, or church ; and they 
consider themselves, though united in 
one body, or visible church, as spiritually 
joined in the bond of Christian love to 
all who are taught of God, and belong 
to the universal church of Christ, how- 
ever much they may differ in forms, 
which they deem non-essentials. 

The Moravians are called Herrn- 
huters, from Herrnhuth, the name of 
the village where they were first settled. 
They also go by the name of Unitas 
Fratrum, or United Brethren. If the 
reader wish to have a fuller account of 
this society, he may consult Crantz's

MORTALITY, subjection to death. 
It is a term also used to signify a con- 
tagious disease which destroys great 
numbers of either men or beasts. Bills 
of Mortality are accounts or registers 
specifying the numbers born, married, 
and buried, in any parish, town, or dis- 
trict. In general, they contain only these 
numbers, and even when thus limited 
are of great use, by showing the degrees 
of healthiness and prolifickness, and the 
progress of population in the place 
where they are kept. 

MORTIFICATION, any severe 
penance observed on a religious ac- 
count. The mortification of sin in be- 
lievers is a duty enjoined in the sacred 
Scriptures, Rom. viii. 13. Col. iii. 5. It 
consists in breaking the league with sin ; 
declaration of open hostility agamst it ;

and strong resistance of it, Eph. vi. 10, 
&amp;c. Gal. V. 24. Rom. viii. 1.3. Tht means 
to be used in this work are, not mace- 
rating the body, seclusion from society, 
our own resolutions : but the Holy Spi- 
rit is the chief agent, Rom. viii. 13. 
Avhile faith, prayer, and dependence are 
subordinate means to this end. The 
Evidences of mortification are, not the 
cessation from one sin, for that may be 
only exchanged for another ; or it may 
be renounced because it is a gi'oss sin ; 
or there may not be an occasion to prac- 
tise it ; but if sin be mortified, we shall 
not yield to temptation ; our minds will 
be more spiritual ; we shall find more 
happiness in spiritual services, and bring 
forth the fruits of the Spirit. Dr. Oiven

MOSAIC DISPENSATION, infe- 
riority of the, to the Gospel dispensa- i 
tion. See Dispensation. 

MOSAIC LAW, or the law of Mo- 
ses, is the most ancient that we know of 
in the world, and is of three kinds ; the 
moral law, the ceremonial law, and the 
judicial law. See Law. Some observe, 
that the diiferent manner in which each 
of these laws was delivered may suggest 
to us a right idea of their different na- 
tures. The moral law, or ten command- 
ments, for instance, was delivered on 
the top of the mountain, in the face of 
the whole world, as being of universal 
influence, and obligatory on all mankind. 
The ceremonial was I'eceived by Moses 
in private in the tabernacle, as being of 
peculiar concern, belonging to the Jews 
only, and destined to cease when the 
tabernacle was down, and the veil of the 
temple rent. As to the judicial law, it 
was neither so publicly nor so audibly 
given as the moral law, nor yet so pri- 
vately as the ceremonial ; this kind of 
law being of an indifferent nature, to be 
observed or not observed, as its rites suit 
with the place and government under 
■which we live. The five books of Mo- 
ses called the Pentateuch, are frequent- 
Iv styled, by way of emphasis, the law. 
This was held by the Jews in such ve- 
neration, that they would not allow it to 
be laid upon the bed of any sick person, 
lest it should be polluted by touching 
the dead. See Law. 

MOSQUE, a temple or place of reli- 
gious worship among the Mahometans. 
AH mosques are square buildings, ge- 
nerally constructed of stone. Before 
the chief gate there is a square court 

{)aved with white marble, and low gal- 
eries round it, whose roof is supported 



by marble pillars. In these galleries 
the Turks wash themselves before they 
go into mosque. In each mosque there 
is a great number of lamps : and be- 
tween these hang many crystal rings, 
ostrich's eggs, and other curiosities, 
which, when the lamps are lighted, 
make a fine show. As it is not lawful 
to enter the mosque with stockings or 
shoes on, the pavements are covered 
with pieces of stuff sewed together, each 
being wide enough to hold a row of men 
kneeling, sitting, or prostrate. 'I'he 
women are not allowed to enter the 
mosque, but stay in the porches with- 
out. About every mosque there are six 
high towers, called minarets, each of 
which has three little open galleries, 
one above another: these towers as 
well as the mosques are covered with 
lead, and adorned with gilding and other 
ornaments; and from thence, instead of 
a bell, the people are called to prayers 
by certain officers appointed for that 
purpose. Most of the mosques have a 
kind of hospital, in which travellers of 
what religion soever are entertained 
three days. Each mosque has also a place 
called tarbe, which is the burying-placc' 
of its founders ; Avithin which is a tomh 
pix or seven feet long, covered with 
green velvet or satin ; at the ends of 
which are two tapers, and round il: 
several seats for those who read the 
Koran, and pray for the souls of the de- 
ceased. 

MOTIVE, that which moves, excites, 
or invites the mind to volition. It may 
be one thing singly, or many things con- 
junctly. Some call it a faculty of the 
mind, by which we pursue good and 
avoid evil. See Will : Edwards on 
the Will, p. 7, 8, 124, 259, 384; Topla- 
dy's Works, vol. ii. p. 41, 42. 

MOURNING, sorrow, grief. See 
Sorrow. 

MOURNING, a particular dress or 
habit worn to signify grief on some me- 
lancholy occasion, particularly the death 
of friends, or of great public characters. 
The modes of mourning are various in 
various countries : as also are the co- 
lours that obtain for that end. In Eu- 
rope the ordinary colour for mourning 
is olack ; in China, it is white ; in Tur- 
key, blue or violet ; in Egypt, yellow ; 
in Ethiopia, brown. Each people pre- 
tend to have their reasons for the par- 
ticular colour of their mourning. W^hite 
is supposed to denote purity ; yellow, 
that death is the end of human hopes, 
as leaves when they fall, and flowers 
when they fade, become yellow ; brown 
denotes the earth, whither the dead re- 
turn ; black, the privation of life, as be-

iiigthe privation of light ; blue expi'esses 
the happiness which it is hoped the de- 
ceased enjoys; and purple or violet, sor- 
row on the one side, and hope on the 
other, as being a mixture of black and 
blue. For an account of the mourning 
of the Hebrews, see Lev. xix. and xxi. 
•Ter. xvi. 6. Numbers, xx. Deuteronomy,

MOVER'S LECTURES, a course of 
eight sermons preached annually, set on 
foot by the beneficence of Lady Moyer, 
about 1720, who left by will a rich le- 
gacy, as a foundation for the same. A 
great number of English writers having 
endeavoured, in a variety of ways, to in- 
validate the doctrine of the Trinity, this 
opulent and orthodox lady was influ- 
enced to think of an institution which 
should produce to posterity an ample col- 
lection of productions in defence of this 
branch of the Christian faith. — The first 
course of these lectures was preached 
by Dr. VV'aterland, on the Divinity of 
Clirist, and are well worthy of perusal. 

MUFTI, the chief of the ecclesiasti- 
cal order, or primate of the Mussulman 
religion. The'authority of the Mufti is 
very great in the Ottoman empire ; for 
even the sultan himself, if he will pre- 
serve any appearance of i-eligion, can- 
not, without first hearing his opinion, 
put any person to death, or so much as 
inflict any coqioral punishment. In all 
actions, and especially criminal ones, 
his opinion is required by giving him a 
writing in which the case is stated un- 
&lt;ler feigned names, which he subscribes 
with the words Olur, or Olinaz, i. e. he 
shall or shall not be punished. 

Such outward honour is paid to the 
Mufti, that the grand seignior himself 
rises up to him, and advances seven 
steps towards him when he comes into 
his pi-esence. He alone has the honour 
.of kissing the sultan's left shoulder, 
whilst the prime vizier kisses only the 
hem of his garment. 

Wlien the grand sei^ior addresses 
any writing to the Mufti, he gives him 
the following titles ; " To the esad, the 
" wisest of the wise : instructed in all 
" knowledge ; the most excellent of ex- 
" cellents ; abstaining from things un- 
" lawful ; the spring of virtue and tme 
" science ; heir of the jiroplietic doc-

The election of the Mufti Is solely in 
the grand seignior, who presents him 



with a vest of rich sables, and allows 
him a salary of a thousand aspers a day, 
which is about five pounds sterling. Be-' 
sides this, he has the disposal of certain 
benefices belonging to the royal mosques, 
which he makes no scruple of selling to 
the best advantage ; and, on his admis- 
sion to his office, he is complimented by 
the agents of the bashaws, who make 
him the usual presents, which general- 
ly amount to a very considerable sum. 

Whatever regard was formerly paid 
to the Mufti, it is now become very lit- 
tle more than form. If he inteiprets the 
law, or gives sentence contrary to the 
sultan's pleasure, he is immediately dis- 
placed, and a more pliant person put in 
his room. If he is convicted of treason, 
or any very great crime, he is put into a 
mctar kept for that pui-pose in the se- 
ven towers of Constantinople, and pound- 
ed to death. 

MUGGLETONIANS, the followers 
of Ludovic Muggleton, a journeyman 
tailor, who, with hiS companion Reeves 
(a person of equal obscurity,) set up for 
great prophets, in the time of Crom- 
well. They pretended to absolve or 
condemn whom they pleased ; and gave 
out that they were the two last witnesses 
spoken of in the Revelation, who were 
to appear previous to the final destruc- 
tion of the world. They affirmed that 
there was no devil at all without the 
body of man or woman ; that the devil 
is man's spirit of unclean I'eason and, 
cursed imagination ; that the ministry 
in this world, whether pi-ophetical or 
ministerial, is all a lie and abomination 
to the Lord ; with a variety of other 
vain and inconsistent tenets. 

MURDER, the act of wilfully and 
feloniously killing a person upon malice 
or forethought. Heart murder is the 
secret wishing or designing the death 
of any man ; yea, the Scripture saith, 
" Whosoever hateth his brother is a 
murderer," 1 John, iii. 15. We have 
instances of this kind of murder in Ahab, 
1 Kings, xxii. 9. Jezebel, 2 Kings, xix. 
2. the Jews, Mark, xi. 18. David, 1 
Samuel, xxv. 21, 22. Jonah, ch. iv. 1, 4. 
Murder is contrary to the authority of 
God, the sovereign disposer of life, 
Deut. xxxii. 39 ; to the goodness of 
God, who gives it. Job, x. 12 ; to the 
law of nature, Acts, xvi. 28 ; to the love 
a man owes to himself, his neighbour, 
and society at large. Not but that life 
may be taken away, as in lawful war, 
1 Chron. v. 22 ; by the hands of the 
civil magistrate for capital crimes, Deut. 
xvii. 8, 10; and in self-defence. See 
Self-defence. 

According to the divine law, murder

is to be punished with death, Deut. xix. 
11, 12. 1 Kings, ii. 28, 29. It is re- 
markable that God often gives up mur- 
derers to the terrors of a guilty con- 
science. Gen. iv. 13, 15, 23, 24. Such 
are followed with many instances of 
divine vengeance, 2 Sam. xii. 9, 10; 
their lives are often shortened. Psalm, 
Iv. 23 ; and judgments of their sin are 
oftentimes transmitted to posterity, Gen. 
xlix. 7. 2 Sam. xxi. 1. 

MUSSELMAN, or Musylman, a 
title by which the Mahometans distin- 

¥iish themselves ; signifying in the 
urkish language "tnae believer, or 
orthodox." There are two kinds of 
Musselmen veiy averse to each other ; 
the one called Sonnites, and the other 
Skates. The Sonnites follow the inter- 
pretation of the Alcoran given by Omar; 
the Shiites are the followers of Ali. 
The subjects of the king of Persia are 
Shiites, and those of the grand seignior 
Sonnites. See Mahometans. 

MYSTERY, nujTTifiov, secret (from 
/iuEiv TO (TTona, to shut the mouth.) It is 
taken, 1. for a truth revealed by God 
which is above the power of our natu- 
ral reason, or which we could not have 
discovered without revelation ; such as 
the call of the Gentiles, Eph. i. 9 ; the 
transforming of some without dying, 
&amp;c. 1 Cor. XV. 51. — 2. The word is also 
used in reference to things which re- 
main in part incomprehensible after they 
are revealed ; such as the incarnation of 
Christ, the resurrection of the dead, &amp;c. 
Some critics, however, observe that the 
word in Scripture does not impoit what 
is incapable m its own nature of being 
understood, but barely a secret, any thing 
not disclosed or published to the world. 

In respect to the mysteries of i-eligion, 
divines have run into two extremes. 
" Some," as one observes, " have given 
up all that was mysterious, thinking 
that they were not called to believe any 
thing but what they could comprehend. 
But if it can be proved that mysteries 
make a part of a religion coming from 
God, it can be no part of piety to discard 
them, as if we were wiser than he." 
And i)esides, upon this principle, a man 
must believe nothing: the various works 
of nature, the growth of plants, instincts 
of brutes, union of body and soul, pro- 
perties of matter, the nature of spirit, 
and a thousand other things, are all re- 
plete with mysteries. If so in the com- 
mon works of nature, we can hardly 
suppose that those things which more 
immediately relate to the Divine Being 
himself, can be without mystery. " The 
other extreme lies in an attempt to ex- 
plain the mysteries of i-evelation, so as to 



free them from all obscurity. To defend 
religion in this manner, is to expose it to 
contempt. The following maxim points 
out the proper way of detence, by which 
both extremes are avoided. Where 
the truth of a doctrine depends not on 
the evidence of the things themselves, 
but on the authority of him who reveals 
it, there the only way to prove the doc- 
trine to be true is to prove the testimony 
of him that revealed it to be infallible." 
Dr. South observes, that the mysterious- 
ness of those paits^of the Gospel called 
the credenda, or matters ofourfaith,\s 
most subservient to the great and im- 
portant ends of religion, and that upon 
these accounts : First, because religion, 
in the prime institution of it, was de- 
signed to make impressions of awe and 
reverential fear upon men's minds. — 2. 
To humble the pride and haughtiness 
of man's reason. — 3. To engage us in a 
closer and more diligent search into 
them. — 4. That the full and entire 
knowledge of divine things may be one 
principal pait of our felicity hereafter.

MYSTERIES, a term used to de- 
note the secret rites of the Pagan su- 
perstition, which were carefully con- 
cealed from the knowledge of the 
vulgar. 

The leanied bishop Warburton sup- 
posed that the mysteries of the Pagan 
religion were the invention of legislators 
and other great personages, whom for- 
tune or their own merit had placed at 
the head of those civil societies which 
were formed in the earliest ages in dif- 
ferent parts of the world. 

Mosheim was of opinion that the mys- 
teries were entirely commemorative ; 
that they were instituted with a view to 
preserve the remembrance of heroes 
and great men who had been deified in 
consideration of their mai'tial exploits, 
useful inventions, public virtues, and es- 
pecially in consequence of the benefits 
by them conferred on their contempo- 
raries. 

Others, however, suppose that the 
mysteries were the offspring of bigotn' 
and priestcraft, and that they originated 
in Egypt, the native land of idolati-}-. 
In that country the priesthood ruled 
predominant. The kings were engraft- 
ed into their body before they could as- 
cend the throne. They were possessed 
of a third part of all the land of Egvp^

The sacerdotal function was confined to 
one tribe, and was transmitted unalien- 
able from father to son. All the orien- 
tals, but more especially the Eg\';ptians, 
delighted in mysterious and allegorical 
doctrines. Every maxim of morality, 
eveiy tenet of theology, every dogma of 
philosophy, was wrapt up in a veil of 
allegory and mysticism. This propen- 
sity, no doubt, conspired with avarice 
and ambition to dispose them to a dark 
and mysterious system of religion. Be- 
sides the Egyptians were a gloomy race 
of men ; they delighted in darkness and 
solitude. Their sacred rites were ge- 
nerally celebrated with melancholy airs, 
weeping, and lamentation. This gloomy 
and unsocial bias of mind must have 
stimulated them to a congenial mode of 
worship. 

MYSTICS, a sect distinguished by 
their professing piire, sublime, and per- 
fect devotion, with an entire disinterest- 
ed love of God, free from all selfish con- 
siderations. — The authors of this mystic 
science, which sprung up towards the 
close of the third century, are not 
known ; but the principles from which 
it was formed are manifest. Its first 
promoters proceeded from the known 
doctrine of the Pl'atonic school, which 
was also adopted by Origen and his 
disciples, that the divine nature was 
diffused through all human souls ; or 
that the faculty of reason, from which 
proceed the health and vigour of the 
mind, was an emanation from God into 
the human soul, and comprehended in 
it the principles and elements of all 
truth, human and divine. They denied 
that men could, by labour or study, ex- 
cite this celestial flame in their breasts ; 
and therefore they disapprove highly 
of the attempts of those who, by defini- 
tions, abstract theorems, and profound 
speculations, endeavoured to form dis- 
tmct notions of truth, and to discover its 
hidden nature. On the contrary, they 
maintained that silence, tranquillity, re- 
pose, and solitude, accompanied with 
such acts as might tend to extenuate 
and exhaust the body, were the means 
by which the hidden and internal word 
was excited to produce its latent vir- 
tues, and to instruct men in the know- 
ledge of divine things. For thus they 
reasoned : — Those who behold with a 
noble contempt all human affairs ; who 
turn away their eyes from terrestrial 
vanities, and shut all the avenues of the 
outward senses against the contagious 
influence of a material world, must ne- 
cessarily return to God when the spirit 
is thus disengaged from the impedi- 
ments that prevented that happy union ; 



and in this ble3sed ft'ame they not only 
enjoy inexpressible raptui-es from their 
communion with the Supreme Bein^, 
but are also invested with the inesti- 
mable privilege of contemplating truth 
undisguised and uncorrupted in its na- 
tive purity, while others behold it in a 
vitiated and delusive form. 

The number of the Mystics increased 
in the fourth century, under the influ- 
ence of the Grecian fanatic, who gave 
himself out for Dionysius the Areopa- 
gite, disciple of St. Paul, and probably 
lived about this period ; and by pre- 
tending to higher degrees of perfection 
than other Christians, and practising 
greater au.sterity, their cause gained 
ground, especially in the eastern pro- 
vinces, in the fifth century. A copy of 
the prietended works of Dionysius was 
sent by Balbus to Lewis the Meek, in 
the year 824, which kindled the only 
flame of mysticism in the western pro- 
vinces, and filled the Latins with the 
most enthusiastic admiration of this new 
religion. In the twelfth century these 
Mystics took the lead in their method 
of expounding the Scriptures. In the 
thirteenth century they were the most 
form idable antagonists of the schoolmen ; 
and towards the close of the fourteenth, 
many of them resided and propagated 
their tenets almost in every part of 
Europe. They had, in the fifteenth cen- 
tury, many persons of distinguished 
merit in their number; and in the six- 
teenth century, previous to the reforma- 
tion, if any sparks of real piety subsisted 
under the despotic empire of supersti- 
tion, they were only to be found among 
the Mystics. The celebrated Madame 
Bourignon, and the amiable Fenelon, 
archbishop of Cambi-ay, were of this 
sect. Dr. Haweis, in speaking of the 
Mystics' Church History, vol. iii. p. 47, 
thus observes : " Among those called 
Mystics, I am persuaded some were 
found who loved God out of a pure 
heart fervently ; and though they were 
ridiculed and reviled for proposing a 
disinterestedness of love without other 
motives, and as professing to feel in the 
enjoyment of the temper itself an abun- 
dant reward, their holy and heavenly 
conversation will carry a stamp of real 
religion upon it." 

As the late Reverend ^^'illiam Law, 
who was born in 1687, makes a dis- 
tinguished figure among the modem 
Mystics, a brief account of the outlines 
of his system may, perhaps be entei'- 
taining to some readers. — He supposed 
that the material world was the very 
region which orignally belonged to the 
fallen angels. At length the light and

NAT 



Spirit of God entered into the chaos, 
and turned the angels' ruined kingdom 
into a paradise on earth. God then 
created man, and placed him there. 
He was made in the image of the Tri- 
une God, a living mirror of the divine 
nature, formed to enjoy communion 
with Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and 
live on earth as the angels do in heaven. 
He was endowed with immortality, so 
that the elements of this outward world 
could not have any power of acting on 
his body ; but by his fall he changed 
the light, life, and Spirit of God for the 
light, life, and spii-it of the woi-ld. He 1 
died the very day of his transgression to | 
all the influences and operations of the 
Spirit of God upon him, as we die to the 
influences of this world when tlie soul 
leaves the body ; and all the influences 
and operations of the elements of this 
life were open in him, as they were in 
any animal, at his birth into this world : 
he became an earthly creature, subject 
to the dominion of this outward world, 
and stood only in the highest rank of 
animals. But the goodness of God would 
not leave man in this condition: re- 
demption from it was im mediately grant- 
ed, and the bruiser of the serpent brought 
the light, life, and spirit of heaven, once 
more into the human nature. All men, 
in consequence of the redemption of 
Christ, have in them the first spark, or 
seed, of the divine life, as a treasure hid 
in the centre of our souls, to bring forth. 



by degrees, a new birth of that life which 
was lost in paradise. No son of Adam 
can be lost, only by turning away fnim 
the Saviour within him. The only re- 
ligion which can save us, must be that 
which can raise the light, life, and Spi- 
rit of God in our souls. Nothing can 
enter into the vegetable kingdom" till it 
have the vegetable life in it, or be a 
member of the animal kingdom till it 
liave the animal life. Thus all nature 
joins with the (iospel hi affirming that 
no man can enter into the kingdom of 
heaven till the heavenly life is born hi 
him. Nothing can be our righteousness 
or recovery but the divine nature of Je- 
sus Christ derived to our souls. Law's

MYTHOLOGY, in its original im- 
port, signifies any kind of fabulous doc- 
trine. In its more appropriated sense, 
it means those fabulous details concern- 
ing the objects of worship, which were 
invented and propagated by men who 
lived in the early ages of the world, and 
by them transmitted to succeeding ge- 
nerations, eitiier by written records or 
by oral tradition. See articles Hea- 
then, Paganism, and Gale's Court of 
the Geiitiles, a work calculated to show 
that the pagan philosophers derived 
their most sublime sentiments from the 
Scriptures. Bryant's System of Aiicienr

NATIVITY OF CHRIST. The 
birth of our Saviour was exactly as pre- 
dicted by the prophecies of the Old 
Testament, Isa. vii. 14. Jer. xxxi. 22. 
He was bom of a vii'gin of the House of 
David, and of the tribe of Judah, Mat- 



thew, 1. Luke, i. 27. His coming into 
the world was after the manner of other 
men, though his generation and concep- 
tion were extraordinary. The place of 
his birth was Bethlehem, Mic. v. 2. Matt, 
ii. 4, 6, where his parents were won- 
derfully conducted by providence, Luke 
ii. 1, 7. The time of his birth was fore- 
told by the prophets to be before the 
sceptre or civil government departed 
from Judah, Gen. xlix. 10. Mai. iii. 1. 
Hag. ii. 6, 7, 9. Dan. ix. 24; but the 
exact year of his birth is not agreed on 
by clironologers, but it was aljout the 
four thousandth year of the world ; nor 
can the season of the vear, the month, 
and day in which he was born, be as- 
certained. The Egyptians placed it in 
1 JanuaiT ; Wagenseil, in February ; Bo- 
chart, m March, some, mentioned by 
Clement of Alexandria, in April; others, 
in Mav ; Epiphanius speaks of some who

placed it hi June, and of others who sup- 
posed it to have been in July ; Wagen- 
seil, who Avas not sure of February fixed 
it probably in August; Lightfoot, on the 
fifteenth of September ; Scaliger, Casau- 
bon, and Calvisius, in October; others, 
in November ; and the Latin church in 
December. It does not, however, ap- 
pear probable that the vulgar account is 
right; the circumstance of the shep- 
lierds watching their flocks by night, 
agrees not with the winter season. Dr. 
Gill thinks it was more likely in autumn, 
h\ the month of Septemlier, at the feast 
of tabernacles, to which there seems 
some reference in John, i. 14. The 
Scripture, however, assures us that it 
was in the "fulness of time," Gal. iv. 
4 ; and, indeed the Avisdom of God is 
evidently displayed as to the time when, 
as well as the end for which Christ 
came. 

It was in a time when the world stood 
in need of such a Saviour, and was best 
prepared for receiving him. " About 
the time of Christ's appearance," says 
Dr. Robertson, " there prevailed a ge- 
neral opinion that the Almighty would 
send forth some eminent messenger to 
communicate a more perfect discovery 
of his will to mankind. The dignity o'f 
Christ, the virtues of his character, the 
glory of his kingdom, and the signs of his 
coming, were described by the ancient 
l)rophets with the utmost perspicuity. — 
Guided by the sure word of prophecy, 
the Jews of that age concluded the period 
predetermined by (iod to be then com- 
pleted, and that the promised Messiah 
would suddenly appear, Luke, ii. 25 to 
38. Nor were these expectations pe- 
culiar to the Jews. By their dispersions 
among so many nations, by their con- 
versation with t'lie learned men among 
the heathens and the translation of their 
inspired writings into a language almost 
universal, the principles of their reli- 
gion were spread all over the East ; 
and it became the common belief that a 
Prince would arise at that time in Judea, 
Avho should change the face of the world, 
and extend his empire from one end of 
the earth to the other. Now, had Christ 
been manifest at a more early pe- 
riod, the world would not have been 
prepared to meet him with the same 
fondness and zeal ; had his appearance 
been put off for any considerable time, 
men's expectations would have be^n 
to lang-uish, and the warmth of desire, 
from a delay of gi'atification, might have 
cooled and died away. 

" The birth of Christ was also in the 
fulness of time, if we consider the then 
political state of the world. The world, 



in the most early ages, was divided into 
small independent states, differing from 
each other in language, manners, laws, 
and religion. The shock of so many op- 
posite interests, the interfering of so 
many contrary views, occasioned the 
most violent convulsions and disorders; 
perpetual discord subsisted between 
these rival states, and hostility and 
bloodshed never ceased. Commerce 
had not hitherto united, mankind, and 
opened the conmiunication of one nation 
with another : voyages into remote coun- 
tries were very rare ; men moved in a 
narrow circle, little acquainted with any 
thing beyond the limits of their own 
small territory. At last the Roman am- 
bition undertook the arduous enter- 
prise of conquering the world: They 
trod down the kingdoms, according to 
Daniel's prophetic description, by their 
ejccreding strength ; they de~vourcd the 
whole earth, Dan. vii. 7, 23. HoAvever, 
by enslaving the world, they civilized 
it, and Avhile they oppressed mankind, 
they united them together : the same 
laAvs Avere every where established, and 
the same languages understood ; men 
approached nearer to one another in 
sentiments and manners, and the inter- 
course betAveen the most distant corners 
of the earth was rendered secure and 
agreeable. Satiated Avith victory, the 
first emperors abandoned all thoughts 
of ncAv conquests ; peace, an unknown 
blessing, was eujoj^ed through all that 
vast empire; or if a slight Avar was 
Avaged on an outlying and barbarous 
frontier, far from disturbing the tran- 
quillity, it scarcely drew the attention of 
mankind. The disciples of Christ, thus 
favoured by the union and peace of the 
Roman empire, executed their com- 
mission Avith great advantage. Tlie suc- 
cess and rapidity with which they dif- 
fused the knowledge of his name over 
the Avorld are astonishing. Nations 
Avere uoav accessible Avhich formerly had 
been unknoAvn. Lender this situation, 
into Avhich the providence of God had 
brought the Avorld, the joyfitl sound in 
a feAV vears I'eached those remote cor- 
ners 01 the earth into Avhich it could not 
otherwise have penetrated for many 
ages. Thus the Roman ambition and 
bravery paA'ed the way, and prepared 
the Avorld for the reception of the 
Christian doctrine." 

If Ave consider the state of the world 
Avith regard to morals, it evidently ap- 
pears that the coming of Christ was at 
the most appropriate time. " The Ro- 
mans," continues our author, " by sub- 
duing the world, lost their own liberty. 
Many vices, engendered or nourished

by prosperity, delivered them over to 
the vilest race of tyrants that ever af- 
flicted or disgraced human nature. The 
colours ai-e not too strong which the 
apostle employs in drawing the charac- 
ter of that age. See Eph. iv. 17, 19. In 
this time of universal corruption did the 
wisdom of God manifest the Cliristian 
revelation to the world. What the wis- 
dom of men could do for the encourage- 
ment of virtue in a corrupt world had 
been tried during several ages, and all 
human devices were found by expe- 
rience to be of very small avail ; so tliat 
no juncture could be more proper for 
publishing a religion, which, mdependent 
of human laws and institutions, explains 
the principles of morals with admirable 
perspicuity, and enforces the practice of 
them by niost pei'suasive arguments." 

Tlie wisdom of God will still farther 
jippear in the time of Christ's coming, 
if we consider the world with regai'd to 
its religions state. " The Jews seem to 
have been deeply tinctured with super- 
stition. Delighted with the ceremonial 
prescriptions of the law, they utterly 
neglected the moral. While the Pha- 
risees undermined religion, on the one 
hand, by their \'ain traditions and wretch- 
ed interpretations of the law, the Sad- 
ducees denied the immortality of the 
soul, and overturned the doctrine of fu- 
ture rewards and punishments ; so that 
between tliem the knowledge and power 
of true religion were entirely destroyed. 
But the deplorable situation of the hea- 
then world called still more loudly for 
an immediate interposal of the divine 
hand. The characters of their heathen 
deities were infamous, and their reli- 
gious worsliip consisted fi-equently in 
the vilest and most shameful rites. Ac- 
cording to the apostle's observation, they 
ivere in all things too superstitious. 
Stately temples, expensi\'e sacrifices, 
pompous ceremonies, magnificent festi- 
vals, with all tlie other circumstances of 
show and splendour, were the objects 
which false religion presented to its vo- 
taries ; but just notions of God, obe- 
dience to his moi-al laws, purity of 
heart, and sanctity of life, were not 
once mentioned as ingi'edients in reli- 
gious service. Rome adopted the gods 
of almost every nation whom she had 
conquered, and opened her temples to 
the grossest superstitions of tlie most 
barbarous people. Her foolish heart 
being darkened, she changed the glory 
of the incorruptible God into an image 
made like to corruptible man, and to 
birds, and four-footed beasts, and creep- 
ing things, Rom. i. 21, 23. No period, 
therefoi'c, can be mentioned when in- 



structions would have been more sea- 
sonal)lc and necessary ;" and no won- 
der that those who were looking for sal- 
vation should joyfully exclaim, " Bless- 
ed be the Lord God of Israel, for he 
hath visited and redeemed his people." 

The nativity of Christ is celebrated 
among us on the t\yenty-fifth day of De- 
cember, and divine service is performed 
in tlie church, and in many places of 
worship among dissenters; but, alas! 
the da}', we fear, is more generally pro- 
faned tl\an improved. Instead of being 
a season of real devotion, it is a season 
oi great diversion. The luxury, extra- 
vagance, intemperance, obscene plea- 
sures, and drunkenness that abound, are

NATURE, the essential properties 
of a thing, or that by which it is dis- 
tinguished from all others. It is used 
also, for the S3'stem of the world, and 
the Creator of it; the aggregate powers 
of the human body, and common sense, 
Rom. i. 26, 27. 1 Cor. xi. 14. The 
word is also used in reference to a va- 
riety of other objects which \?&amp; shall 
here enumerate. 1. The divine nature is 
not any external form or shape, but his 
glory, excellency, and perfections, pe- 
culiar to himself. — 2. Human nature 
signifies the state, properties, and pecu- 
liarities of man. — 3. Good nature is a 
disposition to please, and is compound- 
ed of kinchiess, forbearance, forgiveness, 
and self-denial. — 4. Tlie lanu of&gt;iutureis 
the will of God relating to human ac- 
tions, grounded in the moral differences 
of things. Some understand it in a more 
comprehensive sense, as signifying those 
stated orders by whicli aU the parts of 
the material world are governed in 
tlieir several motions and operations. — 
5. The light of nature does not consist 
merely in those ideas which heathens 
have actually attained, but those which

are presented to men bj' the works of 
creation, and whicli, by the exertion of 
reason, they may obtain, if they be de- 
sirous of retamiiig God in their mind. 
See Religion. — 6. By the dictates of 
nature, with regard to right and wrong, 
we understand those things which ap- 
pear to the mind to • be natural, lit, or 
J'easonable. — 7. The state of nature is 
that in which men have not by nmtual 
engagements, imphcit or express, enter- 
ed communities. — 8. Depraved nature 
is that corrupt state in which all man- 
kind are born, and which inclines them 
to evil. 

NAZARENES, Christians convert- 
ed from Judaism, whose chief error con- 
sisted in defending the necessity or ex- 
pediency of the works of the law, and 
Avho obstinately adhered to the practice 
of the Jewish ceremonies. The name 
of Nazarenes, at first, had nothing 
odious in it, and it was often given to 
the first Christians. The fathers fre- 
quently mention the Gospel of the Na- 
zarenes, which differs nothing from that 
of St. Ma.tthew, whicli was either in 
Hebrew or Syriac, for the use of the 
first conceits, but was afterwards cor- 
rupted by tlie Ebionites. These Naza- 
i^enes preserved their first Gospel in its 
primitive puiity. Some of them were 
still in being in the time of St. Jerome, 
%vho does not reproach them with any 
errors. They were very zealous ob- 
servers of the law of Moses, but held 
the traditions of the Pharisees m very 
great contempt. 

The word Nazarene was given to Je- 
sus Christ and his disciples ; and is com- 
monly taken in a sense of derision and 
contempt in such authors as ha\ e writ- 
ten against Christianity. 

NAZARITES, those under the an- 
\:ient la^v who made a vow of observing 
a more than ordinary degree of purity, 
as Samson and John the Baptist. The 
Nazarites engaged by a vow to abstain 
from wine and all intoxicating liquors; 
to let their hair grow without cutting or 
shaving ; not to enter into any house 
that was polluted by having a dead 
corpse in it ; nor to be present at any 
funeral. And if by chance any one 
should have died in their presence, they 
began again the whole ceremony of 
their consecration and Nazariteship. — 
This ceremony generally lasted eight 
days, sometimes a month, and some- 
times their whole lives. When the time 
of their Nazariteship was accomplished, 
the priest brought the person to the 
door of the temple, who there offered to 
the Lord a he-lamb for a burnt-offei-ing, 
a she-lamb for an expiatory sacrifice. 



and a ram for a peace offering. They 
offered likewise loaves and cakes, with 
wine necessary for the libations. After 
all this was sacrificed and offered to the 
I..ord, the priest or some other person, 
shaved the head of the Nazarite at the 
door of the tabernacle, and burnt his 
hair, throwing it upon the fire of the al- 
tar. Then the priest put into the hand 
of the Nazarite the shoulder of the 
ram, roasted, with a loaf and a cake, 
which the Nazarite returning into the 
hands of the priest, he offered them to 
the Lord, lifting them up hi the pre- 
sence of the Nazarite. And from this 
time he might again drink wuie, his 
Nazariteship being now accompUshed. 
Numb. vi. Amos ii. 11, 12. 

Those that made a vow of Nazarite- 
ship out of Palestine, and could not 
come to the temple when their vow was 
expired, contented themselves with ob- 
serving the abstinence required by the 
law, and after that, cutting their hair in 
tlie place where they were : as to the 
offerings and sacrifices presciibed by 
Moses, which were to be offered at the 
temple by themselves, or by others for 
them, they deferred this till they could 
have a convenient opportunity. Hence 
it Avas that St. Paul, being at Corinth, 
and having made a vow of a Nazarite, 
had his hair cut off at Cenchrea, and 
put off fulfilling the rest of his vow till 
he should arrive at Jerusalem, Acts 
xviii. 18. \^'^llen a person found that he 
was not in a condition to make a vow of 
Nazariteship, or had not leisure to per- 
form the ceremonies belonging to it, he 
contented himself by contributing to ihe 
expense of the sacrifice and offerings of 
those that had made and fulfilled this 
vow ; and by this means he became a 
])aitaker in the merit of such Nazarite- 
ship. When St. Paul came to Jerusa- 
lem, in the year of Christ 53, the apos- 
tle St. James the Less, with the othei- 
brethren, said to him (Acts xxi. 23, 
24,) that to quiet the minds of the con- 
verted Jews, who had been informed 
that he e\ ery where preached up the 
entire abolition of the law of Moses, he 
ought to join himself to four of the 
faithful who had a vow of Nazariteship 
upon them, and contribute to the charge 
of the ceremony at the sha\ ing of their 
heads; by which the new converts 
would perceive that he continued to 
keep the law, and that what they had 
heard of him was not true. 

NECESSx\RIANS, an appellation 
which may be gi\'en to all who maintain 
that moral agents act from necessity. 
See next article, and Materialists. 

NECESSITY, whatever is done by a 



NEC 



405 



NEO 



cause or power that is irresistible, iii 
wli ch sense it is opposed to tVcedom. 
Man is a necessaiy agent, if all his ac- 
tions be so determined by the causes 
preceding each action, that not one past 
action could possilDly not have come to 
pass, or have been otherwise than it 
hath been, nor one future action can 
possibly not come to pass, or be other- 
wise than it shall be. On the other 
liand, it is asserted, that he is a free 
agent, if he be able at any time, under 
the causes and circumstances he then 
is, to do diflferent things ; or, in other 
words, if he be not unavoidably deter- 
mined in every point of time by the cir- 
cumstances he is in, and the causes he 
is vuider, to do aii)^ one thing he does, 
and not possibly to do any other thing. 
Whether man is a necessary or a free 
agent, is a question which has been de- 
bated by writers of the first eminence. 
Hobbes, Collins, Hume, Leibnitz, Kaims, 
Hartley, Priestley, Edwards, Cronibie, 
Toplady.and Belsham, ha\e v&gt;rittcn on 
the side of necessity ; while Clarke, 
King, Law, Reid, Butler, Price, Bryant, 
Wollaston, Horsley, Beattie, Gregory, 
and Butterwoith, ha\'e written against 
it. To state all their argimients in this 
place, would take up too much room ; 
suffice it to say, that the Anti-necessa- 
rians suppose that the doctrine of ne- 
cessity charges God as the author of 
sin ; that it takes away the freedom of 
the will, renders man unaccountable, 
makes sin to be no evil, or morality or 
virtue to be no good ; precludes the use 
of means, and is of the most gloomy ten- 
dency. The Necessarians deny these 
to be legitimate consequences, and ob- 
serve that the Deity acts no more im- 
morally in decreeing vicious actions, 
than in permitting all those in'egulari- 
ties which he could so easily have pre- 
A'ented. The difficulty is the same on 
each hypothesis. All necessity, say 
they, doth not take away freedom. 
The actions of a man may be at one 
and the same time free and necessary 
too. It was infallibly certain that Judas 
would betray Christ, yet he did it vo- 
luntaril)'. Jesus Christ necessarily be- 
came man, and died, yet he acted freely. 
A ^ood man doth naturally and neces- 
sarily love his children, yet voluntaril^^ 
It is part of the happiness of the blessed 
to lo\ e God unchangeably, yet freely, 
for it would not be their' happiness if 
done by compulsion. Nor does it, says 
the Necessarian, render man unac- 
countable, since the Divine Being does 
no injuries to his rational faculties ; and 
man, as his creature, is answerable to 
him; besides he has a right to do what 



he will with his own. That necessity 
doth not render actions less morally 
good, is e\ident ; for if necessary ^'irtue 
be neither moral nor praise-worthy, it 
will follow that God himself is not a 
moral being, because he is a necessaiy 
one ; and the obedience of Christ can- 
not be good because it was necessary. 
Farther, say they, necessity does not 
preclude the use of means ; for means 
are no less appointed than the end. It 
was ordained that Christ should be de- 
li% ered up to death ; but he could not 
ha\'e been betra}'ed without a betrayer, 
nor crucified without cnicifiers. That 
it is not a gloomy doctrine, they allege, 
because nothing can be more consola- 
tory than to believe that all things arc 
under the direction of an all- wise Being ; 
that his kingdom ruleth over all, and 
that he doth all things well. So far 
from its being inimical to happiness, 
they suppose tnere can be no solid true 
happiness without the belief of it; that 
it inspires gratitude, excites confidence, 
teaches resignation, produces humility, 
and draws the soul to God. It is also 
observed, that to deny necessity is to 
deny the foreknowledge of God, and to 
wrest the sceptre from the hand of the 
Creator, and to place that capricious 
and undefinable principle — The self-de- 
termining power of man, upon the 
throne of the uni\'erse. Beside, say 
they, the Script-ire places the doctrine 
beyond all doubt, Job xxiii. 13, 14. Job 
xxxiv. 29. Prov. xvi. 4. Is. xlv. 7. Acts 
xiii. 48. Eph. i. 11. 1 Thess. iii. 3. Matt. 
X. 29, 30. Matt, xviii. 7. Luke xxiv. 26. 
John vi. 37. See the works of the 
above-mentioned writers on the subject ;

NECROLOGY, fomiedof v£»jo,, dead,

book anciently kept in churches and 
monasteries, wherein were registered 
the benefactors of the same, the time of 
their deaths, and the days of their com- 
memoration; as also the deaths of the 
pi'iors, abbots, religious canons, &amp;c. 
This was otherwise called calendar and

NEONOMIANS, so called from the 
Greek vtos, new, and vojios, laiv ; signi- 
fying a new law, the condition w hereof 
is imperfect, though sincere and perse- 
vering obedience. 

Neonomianism seems to be an essen- 
tial part of the Arminian system. " The 
new covenant of grace which, through 
the medium of Christ's death, the Fa-

ther made with men, consists accordin,^ 
to this sj'stem, not in oui' being justified 
by faith", as it apprehends the righte- 
ousness of Christ, but in this, that God, 
abrogating the exaction of perfect legal 
obedience, reputes or accepts of faith 
itself, and the imperfect obedience of 
faith, instead of the perfect obedience 
of the law, and graciously accounts them 
AV'orthy of the reward of eternal life." — 
This opinion was examined at the synod 
of Dort, and has been can\'assed be- 
tween the Calvmists and Arminians on 
\-arious occasions. 

Towards the close of the seventeenth 
centuiy a contro\'ersy was agitated 
amongst the English dissenters, in which 
the one side, who were partial to the 
writings of Dr. Crisp, were charged 
with Anlhtomiaim^n, and the other, who 
favoured Mr. Baxter, were accused of 
Neoncmianism. Dr. Daniel Williams, 
who was a principle writer on what was 
called the Neonomian side, after many 
things had been said, gives the follow- 
ing as a summary of his' -faith in refer- 
ence to those subjects. — " 1. (iod has 
eternally elected a certain definite num- 
ber of men whom he will infallibly save 
by Christ in that way prescribed by the 
Gospel. — 2. These very elect are not 
personally justified until they receive 
Christ, and yield up themselves to him, 
but they remain condemned whilst un- 
converted to Christ. — 3. By the ministry 
of the Gospel there is a serious offer of 
pardon and glory, upon the terms of the 
Gospel, to all that hear it ; and God 
thereby requires them to comply with 
the said terms. — 4. Miirsters ought to use 
these and other Gospel benefits as mo- 
tives, assui'ing men tliat if they believe 
they shall be justified ; if they turn to 
God, they shall live ; if they repent, 
their sins shall be blotted out ; and 
whilst they neglect these duties, they 
cannot have a personal interest in these 
respective benefits. — 5. It is by the 
power of the Spirit of Christ freely ex- 
erted, and not by the power of free- 
will, that the Gospel becomes effectual 
for the conversion -of any soul to the 
obedience of faith. — 6. When a man be- 
lieves, yet is not that very faith, and 
much less any other work, the matter 
of that righteousness for which a sinner 
is justified, i. e. entitled to pardon, ac- 
ceptance and eternal glory, as righteous 
betore God ; and it is the imputed righ- 
teousness of Christ alone, for which the 
Gospel gives the believer a right to 
these and all saving blessings, who in 
this respect is justified by Christ's righ- 
teousness alone. By both this and the 
fifth head it appeal's that all boasting is 



excluded, and we are saved by ffee 
grace. — 7. Faith alone receives the 
Lord Jesus and his righteousness, and 
the subject of this faith is a convinced 
penitent soul ; hence we are justified by 
faith alone, and yet the im/ienitent are 
not forgiven. — 8. God has freely pro- 
mised that all whom he predestinated 
to salvation shall not only savingly be- 
lieve, but that he by his power shall 
preserve them from a total or a _final 
afiostacy. — 9. Yet the believer, whilst 
he lives in this world, is to pass the 
time of his sojoui'ning here with fear, 
because his warfare is not accomplish- 
ed, and that it is true, that if he draw 
back, God will have no pleasure in him. 
Which with the like cautions Godbless- 
eth as means to the saints perseve- 
rance, and these by ministers should be 
so urged. — 10. The law of innocence, or 
moral law, is so in force still, as that 
every precept thereof constitutes duty, 
even to the believer; every breach 
tliereof is a sin deserving of death : this 
law binds death by its curse on eveiy 
unbeliever, and the righteousness for or 
by which we are justified before God, is 
a righteousness (at least) adequate to 
that law which is Christ's alone righ- 
teousness: and this so imputed to the 
believer as that God deals judicially 
with him according thereto. — 11. Yet 
such is the grace of the Gospel, that it 
promiseth in and by Christ a freedom 
Irom the curse, forgiveness of sin, and 
eternal life, to every sincere believer ; 
which promise God will certainly per- 
form, notwithstanding the threatening 
of the law." 

Dr. Williams maintains the condi- 
tionality of the covenant of grace ; but 
admits, with Dr. Owen, who also uses 
the tei-m condition, that " Christ under- 
took that those who were to be taken 
into this covenant should receix'e grace 
enabling them to comply with the terms 
of it, fulfil its conditions, and yield the 
obedience which God required therein." 

On this subject Dr. Williams further 
says, " The question is hot whether the 
first (viz. regenerating) grace, by which 
we are enabled to perform the condition, 
be absolutely given. This I affirm, 
though that be dispensed ordinarily in a 
due use of means, and in a way discoun- 
tenancing idleness, and fit encourage- 
ment given to the use of means." 

The following objection, among others, 
was made by several ministers in 1692 
against Dr. Williams's Goafiel Truth 
Stated, isfc. " To supply the room of 
the moral law, vacatedby him, he turi« 
the Gospel into a new Law, in keeping 
of which we shall be justified for the

NES 



sake of Christ's righteousness, making 
quahfications and acts of ours a disposing 
subordinate righteousness, whereby we 
become capable of being justified by 
Christ's righteousness." 

To this among other things he an- 
swers, " The difference is not, 1. 
Whether the Gospel be a new law in 
the Socinian, Popish, or Arminian sense. 
This I deny. Nor, 2. Is faitli, or any 
other grace or act of ours, any atone- 
ment for sin, satisfaction to justice, merit- 
ing qualification, or any part of that 
righteousness for which we are justified 
at God our Creator's bar. This I deny 
in places innumerable. Nor, 3. Whether 
the Gospel be a law more new than is 
implied in the first promise to fallen 
Adam, proposed to Cain, and obey- 
ed by Abel, to the differencing him 
from his unbelieving brother. This I 
deny. 4. Nor whether the Gospel be a 
law that allows sin, when it accepts such 
graces as true, though short of per- 
fection, to be the conditions of our per- 
sonal interest in the benefits purchased 
by Christ. This I deny. 5. Nor whether 
the Gospel be a law, the promises 
whereof entitle the performers of its 
conditions to the benefits as of debt. 
This I deny. 

" The difference is, 1. Is the Gospel 
a law in this sense ; viz. God in Christ 
thereby commandeth sinners to repent 
of sin, and receive Christ by a true 
operative faith, promising that there- 
upon they shall be united to him, justi- 
fied by his righteousness, pardoned, and 
adopted ; and that, persevering in faith 
and true holiness, they shall be finally 
saved ; also threatening that if any 
shall die impenitent, unbelieving, un- 
godly, rejecters of his grace, they shall 
perish without relief, and endure sorer 

Eunishments than if these offers had not 
een made to them i* — 2. Hath the Gos- 
pel a sanction, i. e. doth Christ therein 
enforce his commands of faith, repent- 
ance and perseverance, by the afore- 
said promises and threatenings, as mo- 
tives of our obedience ? Both of these I 
affirm, and they deny ; saying the Gos- 
pel in the largest sense is an absolute 
promise without precepts and conditions, 
and the Gospel threat is a bull. — 3. Do 
the Gospel promises of benefits to cer- 
tain graces, and its threats that those 
benefits shall be withheld and the con- 
trary evils inflicted for the neglect of 
such graces, render those graces the 
condition of our personal title to those 
benefits? — This they deny, and I af- 
firm," 8cc. 

It does not appear to have been a 
question m this controversy, whether 



God in ' his word commands sinners to 
repent and believe in Christ, nor whether 
he promises life to believers, and threat- 
ens death to unbelievers ; but whether 
it be the Gospel under the form of a 
new law that thus commands or threat- 
ens, or the moral law on its behalf, and 
whether its promises to believing ren- 
der such believing a condition of the 
things promised. In another contro- 
versy, however, which arose about forty 
years afterwards among the same de- 
scription of people, it became a question 
whether God did by his luord (call it 
law or Gospel) command iinre generate 
sinners to rejient and believe in Christ, 
or to do any thing which is sfiiritually 
good. Of those who took the affirma- 
tive side of this question, one party at- 
tempted to maintain it on the ground of 
the Gospel being a new law, consisting 
of commands, promises, and threat- 
enings, the terms or conditions of which 
were repentance, faith, and sincere obe- 
dience. But those who first engaged in 
the controversy, though they allowed 
the encouragement to repent and be- 
lieve to arise merely from the grace of 
the Gospel, yet considered the formal 
oljligation to do so as arising merely from 
the moral law, which, requiring su- 
preme lo\'e to God, requires acquies- 
cence in any revelation which he shall 
at any time make known. JVitsius's

NESTORIANS, the follower^ of 
Nestorius, the bishop of Constantino- 
ple, who lived in the fifth century. 
They believed that in Chiist there were 
not only two natures, but two persons, or 
uirotrrao-f IS ; of which the one was divine, 
even the eternal word; and the other, 
which was hu7nan,vfa.s the man Jesus; 
that these two persons had only one 
aspect : that the union between the Son 
of God and the son of man was formed 
in the moment of the virgin's conception, 
and was never to be dissolved : that it 
was not, howevei*, an union of nature oi- 
of person, but only of will and affection. 
(Nestorius, howe\er, it is said, denied 
the last position .) th^t Christ was there- 
fore to be carefully distinguished from 
God, who dwelt in him as in his temple ; 
and that Mary was to be called the mo- 
ther of Christ, and not the mother of 
God. 

One of the chief promoters of the 
Nestorian cause was Barsumas, created 
bishop of Nisibis, A. D. 435. Such was 
his zeal and success, that the Nesto- 



NES 



408 



NEW 



rians who still remain in Chaldea, Per- 
sia, Assyria, and the adjacent countries, 
consider him alone as their parent and 
founder. By him Pherozes, the Per- 
sian monarch, was persuaded to expel 
those Christians who adopted the opi- 
nions of the Greeks, and to admit the 
Nestorians in their place, putting them in 
possession of tlie principal seat of ec- 
clesiastical authority in Persia, the see 
of Seleucia, which the patriarch of the 
Nestorians had always filled even down 
to our time. Barsumas also erected a 
school at Nisibis, from which pi-oceeded 
those Nestorian doctors who in the fifth 
and sixth centuries spread abroad their 
tenets through Egypt, Syria, Arabia, 
India, Tartary, and China. 

In the tenth century, the Nestorians 
in Chaldea, whence they are sometimes 
called Chaldeans, extended their spi- 
ritual conquests bevond Mount Imaus, 
and introduced the Christian religion in- 
to Tartary properly so called, and espe- 
cially into that country called Kuril, 
bordering on the northern part of China. 
The prince of that country, whom the 
Nestorians converted to the Christian 
faith, assumed, according to the vulgar 
tradition, the name of John after his 
baptism, to which he added the sur- 
name of Presbyter, from a principle of 
modesty; whence, it is said, his suc- 
cessors were each of them called Pres- 
ter John until the time of Gengis Khan. 
But Mosheim observes, that the famous 
Prester Jolm did not begin to reign in 
that part of Asia before the conclusion 
of the eleventh century. The Nesto- 
rians formed so considerable a body of 
Chi-istians, that the missionaries of 
Rome were industrious in their endea- 
vours to reduce them under the papal 
yoke. Innocent IV. in 1246, and Ni- 
cholas IV. in 1278, used their utmost ef- 
forts for this purpose, but without suc- 
cess. Till the time of pope JuHus III. 
the Nestorians acknowlectged but one 
pati'iarch, who resided first at Bagdad, 
and afterwards at Mousul ; but a divi- 
sion arising among them, in 155 1 the pa- 
triarchate became divided, at least for 
a time, and a new patriarch was conse- 
crated by that pope, whose successors 
fixed their residence in the city of Or- 
mus, in the mountainous parts of Per- 
sia, where they still continue, distin- 
guished by the name of Siineoii ; and so 
far down as the seventeenth century, 
these 'patriarchs perse vei-ed in their 
communion with the church of Rome, 
but seem at present to have withdrawn 
themselves from it. The great Nesto- 
rian pontiffs, who form the opposite 
party, and look with a hostile eye on 



this little patriarch, liave, since the 
year 1559, been distinguished by the ge- 
ner;d denomination of Elias, and reside 
constantly in the city of Mousul. Their 
spiritual dominion is very extensive, 
takes in a great part of Asia, and com- 
prehends also within its circuit the Ara- 
bian Nestorians, and also the Christians 
of St. Thomas, who dwell along the 
coast of Malabar. It is observed, to the 
lasting honour of the Nestorians, that of 
all the Christian societies established in 
the East, they have been the most care- 
ful and successful in avoiding a multi- 
tude of superstitious opinions awd prac- 
tices that have infected the Greek and 
Latin churches. About the middle of 
the seventeenth centurj-, the Romish 
missionaries gained over to their com- 
munion a small number of Nestorians, 
whom they formed into a congregation 
or church ; the patriarchs or bishops of 
Avhich reside in the city of Amida, or 
Diarbeker, and all assume the deno- 
mination of Joseph. Nevertheless, the

NEW PLATONICS, or Ammoni- 
ANS, SO called from Ammonius Saccas, 
who taught with the highest applause 
in the Alexandrian school, about the 
conclusion of the second centuiy. This 
learned man attempted a general re- 
conciliation of all sects, whetlier philo- 
sophical or religious. He maintained 
that the great principles of all philoso- 
phical and religious truth were to be 
found equally m all sects, and that they 
differed from each other only in their 
method of expressing them, in some 
opinions of little or no importance ; and 
that by a proper interpretation of their 
respective '„rntiments they might easily 
be united in one body. 

Ammonius supposed that true philo- 
sophy derived its origm and its con- 
sistence from the eastern nations, that 
it was taught to the Egyptians by Her- 
mes, that it was brought from them_ to 
the Greeks, and preserved in its origi- 
nal purity by Plato, who was the best in- 
tei-preter of Hermes and tlie other ori- 
ental sages. He maintained that all the 
different religions which prevailed in 
the world were in their original integri- 
tv, conformable to this ancient philoso- 
phy : but it unfortunately happened that 
the svmbols and fictions under which.

according to the ancient manner, the 
ancients delivered their pi-ecepts and 
doctrines, were in process of time er- 
roneously understood, both by priests 
and people, in a literal sense ; that in 
consequence of this, the invisible beings 
and demons whom the Supreme Deity 
had placed in the different parts of the 
universe as the ministers of his provi- 
dence, were by the suggestions of super- 
stition converted into gods, and wor- 
shipped with a multiplicity of vain ce- 
remonies. He therefore msisted that 
all the religions of all nations shoidd be 
restored to their primitive standard : 
viz. The ancient Jihiloso^ilnj of the east : 
and he asserted that his project was 
agreeable to the kitentions of Jesus 
Christ, whom he acknowledged to be a 
most excellent man, the friend of God ; 
and affirmed that his sole view in de- 
scending on earth, was to set bounds to 
the reigning superstition, to remove the 
en-ors which had crept into the religion 
of all nations, but not to abolish the an- 
cient theology from which they were 
derived. 

Taking these principles for granted, 
Ammonius associated the sentiments of 
the' Egyptians with the doctrines of 
Plato; and to finish this conciliatory 
scheme, he so interpreted the doctrines 
of the other philosophical and religious 
sects, by ait, invention, and allegory, 
that they seemed to bear some sem- 
blance to the Egyptian and Platonic 
systems. 

With regard to moral discipline, 
Ammonius permitted the people to live 
according to the law of their country, 
and the dictates of nature ; but a more 
sublime rule was laid down for the wise. 
They were to raise above all teiTestrial 
things, by the towering efforts of holy 
contemplation, those souls whose origin 
Avas celestial and divine. They wei-e 
ordered to extenuate by hvmger, tliirst, 
and other mortifications, the sluggish 
body, which restrains the liberty of the 
imrnortal spirit, that in this life they 
might enjoy communion with the Su- 
preme Being, and ascend after death, 
active and unencumbered, to the uni- 
versal Parent, to live in his presence for 
ever. 

NEW TESTAMENT. See Inspi- 
ration, and Scripture. 
NICENE CREED. See Creed. 
NICOLAITANS, heretics who as- 
sumed this name from Nicholas of An- 
tioch ; who, being a Gentile by birth, 
first embraced Judaism and then Chris- 
tianity ; when his zeal and devotion re- 
commended him to the church of Jeini- 
salem, by whom he was '-hoseaoneof 



the first deacons. Many of the primi- 
tive wi-iters believed that Nicholas was 
rather the occasion than the author of 
the infamous practices of those who as- 
sumed his name, who were expi'essly 
condemned by the Spirit of God him- 
self, Rev. ii. 6. And, mdeed, their 
opinions and actions were highly extra- 
vagant and criminal. They allowed a 
community of wives, and made no dis- 
tinction between ordinary meats and 
those offered to idols. According to 
Eusebius, they subsisted but a short time j 
but TeituUian saj's, that they only 
changed their name, and that their 
heresies passed into the sect of the 
Cainites. 

NOETIANS, Christian heretics in 
the third century, followers of Noetius, 
a philosopher of Ephesus, who pretend- 
ed that he was another Moses sent by 
God, and that his brother was a new 
Aaron. His heresy consisted in affirm- 
ing that there was but one person in the 
Ciodhead ; and that the Woixl and the 
Holy Spirit were but external denomi- 
nations given to God in consequence of 
different operations ; that, as Creator, 
he is called Father; as incarnate, Soti ^ 
and as desceiuluig on the apostles, Hijlif 
Ghost. 

NONCONFORMISTS, those who 
refuse to join the established church. 
Nonconformists in England may be con- 
sidered of three sorts. 1. Such as ab- 
sent themselves from divine worship in 
the established church through total ir- 
religion, and attend the service of no 
other persuasion. — 2. Such as absent 
themselves on the plea of conscience; 
as Presbyterians, Independents, Bap- 
tists, &amp;c. — 3. Internal Nonconformists, 
or unprincipled clergymen, who ap- 
plaud and propagate doctrines quite in- 
consistent with several of those articles 
they promised on oath to defend. The 
word is ' generally used in reference to 
those ministers who were ejected from 
their livings by the act of Unifoi-mity, 
in 1662. The number of these was 
about two thousand. Howei'er some 
affect to treat these men with indiffer- 
ence, and silppose that their consciences 
were more tender than they need be, it 
must be remembered, that they were 
men of as extensive learning, great abili- 
ties, ajid pious conduct as ever appear- 
ed. Mv. Locke, if his opinion have any 
weight, calls them " worthy, learned, 
pious, orthodox divines, who did not 
throw themselves out of service, but 
were forcibly ejected." Mr. Bogue 
thus draws their character: "^s to 
their public ministration" he says, " tl\ey 
were orthodox, experimental, serious.,

affectionate, regular, faithful, able, and 
popular preachers. Jls to their moral 
qualities, thejr were de\-out and holy; 
faithful to Christ and the souls of men ; 
wise and pi-udent; of great liberahty 
and kindness ; and strenuous advocates 
for liberty, civil and religious. M to 
their i?itellectual qualities, they were 
learned, eminent, and laborious." These 
men were driven from their houses, 
from the society of their friends, and 
exposed to the greatest difficulties. 
Their burdens were greatly increased by 
the Conventical act, whereby they were 
prohibited from meeting foi- any exer- 
cise of religion (above five in number) 
in any other manner than allowed b}- 
the liturgy or practice of the Church of 
England. For the first offence the pen- 
alty was three months imprisonment, or 
pay five pounds ; for the second offence, 
six months imprisonment, or ten pounds ; 
and for the third offence, to be banish- 
ed to some of the American plantations 
for seven years, or pay one hundred 
pounds; and in case they returned, to 
suffer death without benefit of clergy. 
By virtue of this act, the gaols were 
quickly filled with dissenting Protes- 
tants, and the trade of an informer was 
very gainful. So great Avas the severity 
of these times, says Neale, that they 
were afraid to pray in their families, if 
above four of their acquaintance, who 
came only to visit them, were present : 
some families scrupled askhig a bless- 
ing on their meat if five strangers wei-e 
at table. 

But this was not all (to say nothing of 
the Test act:) in 1665, an act was 
brought into the House to banish them 
from their friends, commonly called the 
Oxford Five Mile Act, by which all 
dissenting ministers, on the penalty of 
forty pounds, who would not take an 
oath (that it was not lawful, upon any 
firetence ivliatever, to take arms against 
the king, &amp;c.) were prohibited from 
coming within five miles of any city, 
town corporate, oi- borough, or any place 
where they had exercised their ministry, 
and fi'om "teaching any school. Some 
few took the oath ; others could not, 
consequently suffered the penalty. 

In 1673, "the mouths of the high 
church pulpiteers, were encouraged to 
open as loud as possible. One, in his 
sermon before the House of Commons, 
told them, that the Nonconformists 
ought not to be tolerated, but to be cur- 
ed by vengeance. He urged them to 
set fire to the faggot, and to teach them 
by scourges or scorpions, and open then- 
eyes with gall." 
Such were the dreadful consequences 



of this intolerant spirit, that it is sup- 
posed near eight thousand died in prison 
in the reign of Charles 11. It is said, 
that Mr. Jeremiah White had carefully 
collected a list of those who had suffer- 
ed between Charles 11. and the revolu- 
tion, which amounted to sixty thousand. 
The same persecutions were carried on 
in Scotland ; and there, as well as in 
England, many, to avoid persecution, 
fled from their countr\-. 

But, notwithstanding all these dread- 
ful and furious attacks upon the Dis- 
senters, they were not extirpated. 
Their very persecution was in their fa- 
vour. The infamous characters of their 
informers and persecutors; their piety, 
zeal, and fortitude, no doubt, had mfiu- 
ence on considerate minds; and, indeed, 
they had additions from the established 
church, which " several clergymen in 
tliis reign deserted as a persecutine 
church, and took their lot among them. ' 
In addition to this, king James suddenly 
altered his measures, granted a univer- 
sal toleration, and preferred Dissenters 
to places of trust and profit, though it 
was evidently with a view to restore 
popery. 

King William coming to the throne, 
the famous Toleration Act passed, by 
which they were exempted from suffer- 
ing the penalties above-mentioned, and 
permission given them to worship God, 
according to the dictates of their own 
consciences. In the latter end of Queen 
Anne's reign they began to be a little 
alarmed. An act of parliament passed, 
called the Occasional Conformity Bill, 
which prevented any person in office 
under the government entering into a 
meeting-house. Another, called the 
Schism Bill, had actually obtained the 
royal assent, which suffered no Dis- 
senters to educate their own children, 
but required them to be put into the 
hands of Conformists; and which for- 
bade all tutors and schoolmasters being 
present at any conventicle, or dissent- 
ing place of worship ; but the very day 
this iniquitous act was to have taken 
place, the Queen died (August 1, 1714.) 

But his majesty king George I. being 
fully satisfied that these hardships were 
brought upon the Dissenters for their 
steady adherence to the Protestant suc- 
cession in his illustrious house against 
a tory and jacobite ministry, who were 
paving the way for a popish pretender, 
procured the repeal of them m the fifth 
year of his reign ; though a clause was 
left that forbade the mayor or other 
magistrate to go into any meeting for 
religious worship with the ensigns of his 
office. See Bogue's Charge at Mr.

NONJURORS, tTiose who refused to 
take the oaths to government, and who 
were in consequence under certain in- 
capacities, and liable to certain severe 
penalties. It can scarcely be said that 
there are any Nonjurors now in the 
kingdom ; and it is well known that 
all penalties have been removed both 
from Papists and Protestants, formerly 
of that denomination, as well in Scot- 
land as in England. — The members of 
the Episcopal church of Scotland have 
long been denominated Nonjurors; but 
perhajjs they are now called so im- 

i properly, as the ground of their dif- 
"erence from the establishment is more 
on account of ecclesiastical than politi- 
cal princi]jles. 

NON-RESIDENCE, the act of not 
residing on an ecclesiastical benefice. 
Nothing can reflect greater disgrace on 
a clergyman of a parish, than to receive 
the emolument without ever visiting his 
parishioners, and being unconcerned for 
the welfare of their souls ; yet this has 
been a reigning evil in our land, and 
proves that there are too many who 
care little about the flock, so that they 
may but live at ease. Let such remem- 
ber what an awful account they will 
have to give of talents misapplied, time 
wasted, souls neglected, and a sacred 
office abused. 

NOVATIANS, J\rovatiani, a sect of 
ancient heretics that arose towards the 
close of the third century ; so called 
from Novatian, a priest of Rome. They 
were also called Cathari, from xoOayos, 
pure, q. d. Puritans. 

Novatian first sepai*ated from the 
communion of pope Cornelius, on pi-e- 
tence of his being too easy in admitting 
to repentance those who had fallen off 
in times 'of persecution. He indulged 
his inclination to severity so far, as to 
deny that such as had fallen into gross 
sins, especially those who had ajiosta- 
thcd from the faith under the persecu- 
tion set on foot by Decius, were to be 
again received into the bosom of the 
church; grounding his opinion on that 
of St. Paul : " It is impossible for those 
" who were once enlightened, and have 
" tasted of the heavenly gift, &amp;c. if they 
"shall fall away, to renew them again 
" unto repentance," Heb. vj, 4 to 6. 



Tlie Novatians did not deny but a 
person falling into any sin, how grievous 
soever, might obtain pardon by repent- 
ance ; for they themselves recommended 
repentance in the strongest terms; but 
their doctrine was, that the church had 
it not in its power to receive sinners 
ijito its communion, as having no way 
of remitting sins but by baptism : whicn 
once received could not be repeated. 

In process of time the JVovatia?is 
softened and moderated the rigour of 
their master's doctrine, and only refused 
absolution to very great sinnei's. 

The two leaders, Novatian and No- 
vatus, were proscribed, and declared 
heretics, not for excluding penitents 
from communion, but for denying that 
the church had the power of remitting 
sins. 

NOVITIATE, a year of* probation 
appointed for the trial of religious, 
whether or no they have a vocation, 
and the necessary qualities for living up 
to the nile, the observation whei'eoi 
they are to bind themselves to by vow. 
The novitiate lasts a year at least; 
in some houses more. It is esteemed 
the bed of the civil death of a no- 
vice, who expires to the world by pro- 
fession. 

NUN, a woman, in several Christian 
countries, who devotes herself, in a clois- 
ter or nunnery, to a religious life. See 
article Monk. 

There wei'e women in the ancient 
Christian church, who made pubHc pro- 
fession of virginity before the monastic 
life was known in' the world, as appears 
from the v\'ritings of Cyprian and Ter- 
tuUian. These, for distinction's sake, 
are sometimes called ecclesiastical vir- 
gins, and were commonly eni'olled in 
the canon or matricula of the church. 
They differed from the monastic vir- 
gins chiefly in this, that they lived pri- 
vately in their father's houses, where- 
as the others lived in communities .- 
but. their profession of virguiity was 
not so strict as to make it criminal 
for them to marry afterwards, if they 
thoughtfit. As to the consecration of 
virgins, it had some things peculiar in it : 
it was usually performed publicly in tlie 
chui-ch by the bishop. The virgin made 
a. public profession of her i-esokition, 
and then the bishop put upon her tiie ac- 
customed habit of sacred virgins. One 
part of this habit was a veil, called the 
sacriim valamen; another was a kind 
of mitre or coronet worn upon the head. 
At present, when a woman is to be 
made a nun, the habit, veil, and ring of 
the candidate are carried to the altar ; 
and she herself, accompanied by her

nearest relations, is conducted to the 
bishop, who, after mass and an anthem 
(the subject of which is " that slie ought 
to have her lamp lighted, because the 
bridegroom is coming to meet her") 
pronounces the benediction : then she 
rises up, and the bishop consecrates the 
new habit, sprinkling it with holy water. 
Wlien the candidate has put on her re- 
ligious habit, she presents herself before 
the bishop, and sings on her knees 
Ancilla Chris'ti sian, &amp;c. then she re- 
ceives the veil, and afterwards the ring, 
by which she is married to Christ ; and, 
lastly, the crown of virginity. When 
she is crowned, an anathema is de- 



nounced against all who shall attempt to 
make her break her vows. In some 
few mstances, perhaps, it may have 
happened tl\at nunneries, monasteries, 
&amp;c. may have been useful as well to 
morality and i-eligion as to literature ; 
in the gi-oss, however, they have been 
highly prejudicial; and however well 
they might be supposed to do when 
.viewed in theory, m fact they are un- 
natural and impious. It was surely far 
from the intention of Providence to se- 
clude youth and beauty in a cloister, or 
to deny them the innocent enjoyment 
of tlieir years and sex. See Monas- 
tery.

OATH, a solemn affirmation, where- 
in 'ive appeal to God as a witness of the 
tmth of what we say, and with an im- 
pi-ecation of his vengeance, or a renun- 
ciation of his favour, if v/hat we affinn 
be 'false, or what we promise be not 
performed. 

" The forms of oaths," says Dr. Paley, 
"like other religious ceremonies, have 
in all ages been various; consisting, 
however, for the most part, of some bo- 
dily action, and of a prescribed form of 
words. Amongst tl:e Jews, the juror 
held up his right hand towards heaven, 
Psal. cxliv. 8. Rev. x. 5. (The same 
form is retained in Scotland still.) 
Amongst the Jews, also, an oath of fi- 
delity was taken by the servant's put- 
ting his hand under the thigh of his lord. 
Gen. xxiv. 2. Amongst the Greeks and 
Romans, the form varied with the sub- 
ject and occasion of the oath: in pri- 
vate contracts, the parties took hold of 
each other's hand, whilst they swore to 
the performance ; or they touched the 
altar of the god by whose divinity they 
awore. Upon more solemn occasions it 
•was the custom. to slay a victim, and the 
beast being struck down, with . cer- 
tain ^ceremonies and invocations, gave 
birth to tlie expressions, rmnw opHsv,ferire 
fiactum; anti to our English phrase 
translated from these, of 'striking a 
bargain.' Tlie forms of oaths in Chris- 
tia,n» countries are also very different; 
but in no country in tl»e world worse 
conti'ived, either to convey the meaning, 
or impress the obligation of an oath 
than in our own. The juror with us 
after repeating the promise or affimna- 
tioM which the oath is intended to con- 
firm, adds, ' So help me God;' or more 



frequently the substance of the oath is 
repeated to the juror by the magisti-ate, 
who adds in the conclusion, 'bo help 
you God.' The energy of the sentence 
resides in the particle so; so, that is, 
hac lege, upon condition of my speak- 
ing the tiTith, or performing this pro- 
mise, and not otherwise, may God help 
me. The juror, whilst he liears or re- 
peats the words of the oath, holds his 
right hand upon the Bible, or other book 
containing the four Gospels, and at the 
conclusion kisses the book. This ob- 
scure and eliptical form, together with 
the levity and frequency with which it 
is administered, has brought about a 
general ihad\'ertencv to the obligation 
of oaths, which both in a religious and 
political view is much to be lamented : 
and it merits public consitleration," 
continues, Mr. Paley, " whether the re- 
quiring of oaths on so many frivolous 
occasions, especially in the customs, and 
in the qualification for petty offices, has 
any other effect than to make them 
cheap in the minds of the people. A 

fiound of tea cannot travel regularly 
rom the ship to the consumer without 
costing half a dozen oaths at least ; and 
the same security foi" the due discharge 
of their office, namely, that of an oath, 
is required from a churchwarden and 
an archbishop, from a petty constable, 
and the chief justice of England. Oaths, 
however, are lawful; and, whatever be 
the form, the signification, is the same." 
It is evident that so far as atheism pre- 
vails, oaths can be of no use. ' " Remove 
God once out of heaven, and there will 
never be any gods upon earth. If man's 
nature had hot something of subjection 
in it to a Supreme Being, aiid inhe-

vent principles, obligint^ him how to 
behave himself toward God and toward 
the rest of the world, government could 
never have been introduced, nor thought 
of. Nor can there be the least mutual 
security between governors and govern- 
ed, where no God is admitted. For it 
is acknowledging of God in his .supreme 
judgment over the world, that is the 
ground of an oath, and upon which the 
validity .of all human engagements de- 
pend." Historians have justly remark- 
ed, that when the reverence for an oath 
began to be diminished among the Ro- 
mans, and the loose Epicurian system, 
which discarded the belief of Provi- 
dence, was introduced, the Roman ho- 
nour and prosperity from that period 
began to declme. "The Quakers re- 
fuse to swear upon an)' occasion, found- 
ing their sci-uples concerning the law- 
fulness of oaths, upon our Saviour's 
prohibition, 'Swear not at all.' Matt. 
V. 34. But it seems our Lord there re- 
ferred to the vicious, wanton, and un- 
authorized swearing in common dis- 
course, and not to judicial oaths ; for he 
himself answered when interrogated 
upon oath. Matt. xxvi. 63, 64. Mark 
XIV. 61. The apostle Paul also makes 
use of expressions which contain the 
nature of oaths, Rom. i. 9. 1 Cor. xv. 31. 
2 Ccr. i. 18. Gal. i. 20. Heb. vi. 13, 17. 
Oaths are nugatory, that is, carry with 
them no proper force or obligation, 
unless we believe that God will punish 
false swearing with more severity than 
a simple lie or breach of promise ; for 
which belief there are tne following 
reasons: 1. Perjury is a sin of greater 
deliberation. — 2. It violates a superior 
confidence. — 3. God directed the Israel- 
ites to swear by his name, Deut. yi. 13. 
X. 20. and was pleased to confirm his 
covenant with that people by an oath ; 
neither of which it is probable he would 
have done, had he not intended to re- 
present oaths as having some meaning 
and effect beyond the obligation of a 
bare promise. 

" Promissory oaths are not binding 
where the promise itself would not be so. 
See Promises. As oaths are designed 
for the security of the imposer, it is 
manifest that they must be interpreted 
and performed in the sense in which the 
Imposer intends them." Oaths, also, 
must never be taken but in matters of 
importance, nor irreverently, and with- 
out godly fear. Paley's Mor. Phil. ch. 
16. vol. 1. Grot, de Jure, 1. 11. c. 13. ^

Oath of allegiance is as follows ; " I, 
A. B. do sincerely promise and swear, 
that I will be faithful, and bear tme al- 
legiance to his Majesty, King George. 
So help me God." 1 his is taken by 
Protestant dissenting ministers, when 
licensed by the ci^'il magistrate ; as is 
also the following : 

Oath of sufiremacy ; "I, A. B. do 
swear, that I do from my heart abhor, 
detest, and abjui'e, as impious and he- 
retical, that damnable doctrine and po- 
sition, that princes excommunicated or 
deprived by the Pope, or any authority 
of the see of Rome, may be deposed or 
murdered by their subjects, or any other 
whatsoever. And I do declare, that n© 
foreign prince, person, prelate, state, or 
potentate, hath, or ought to have, any 
jurisdiction, power, pre-eminence, or 
authority, ecclesiastical or spiritual, 
within this realm. So help me God." 

OBEDIENCE, the performance of 
the commands of a superior. Obedi- 
ence to God may be considered, 1. As 
■virtual, which consists in a belief of the 
Gospel, of the holiness and equity of its 
precepts, of the truth of its promises, 
and a true repentance of all our sins. 
— 2. Actual obedience, which is the prac- 
tice and exercise of the several gi'aces 
and duties of Christianity. — 3. Perfect 
obedience, which is the exact confor- 
mity of our hearts and lives to the law 
of God, without the least imperfection. 
This last is only peculiar to a glorified 
state. The obligation we are under to 
obedience arises, 1. From the relation we 
stand in to God as creatures. Psalm 
xcv. 6. — 2. From the law he hath re- 
vealed to us in his word, Psalm cxix. 3. 
2 Peter, i. 5, 7. — 3. From the blessings 
of his providence we are constantly re- 
ceiving. Acts xiv. 17. Psalm cxlv. — 
4. From the love and goodness of God 
in the grand work of redemption, 1 Cor. 
vi. 20. As to the nature of this obedi- 
ence, it must be, 1. Active, not only 
avoiding what is prohibited, but per- 
forming what is commanded. Col. iii. S, 
10. — 2. Personal ; for though Christ has 
obeyed the law for us as a covenant of 
works, yet he hath not abrogated it as 
a rule of life, Rom. vii. 22. Rom. iii. 31. 
—3. Sincere, Psalm li. 6. 1 Tim. i. 5. —

OBEDIENCE OF CHRIST is ge- 
nerally divided into active and passive. 
His active obedience implies wlvtt he 
did ; hxa/iassive what he suffered. Some 
divines distinguish these. Tliey refer 
our pardon to his passi\e, and our title 
to glory to his active ol)edience : though. 
Dr. Owen observes, that it cannot be 
clearly e\'inced that there is any such 
thing in propriety of speech as passive 
obedience : obeying is doing, to which 
passion or suffering doth not belong. 
Of the active obedience of Christ the 
Scriptui'cs assure us that he took upon 
him the forn\ of a ser\' ant, and really be- 
came one, Is. xlix. 3. Phil. ii. 5. Heb. 
viii. He was sutjject to the,law of God. 
'•' He was made under the law ;" the 
judicial or civil law of the Jews: the 
ceremonial law, and the moral law, 
Matt. xvii. 24, 27. Luke ii. 22. Psalm 
xl. 7, 8. He was obedient to the law of 
nature ; he was in a state of subjection 
to his parents ; and he fulfilled the com- 
mands of his heavenly Father as it re- 
spected the first and second talile. His 
obedience, 1. Was voluntary. Psalm xl. 
6. — 2. Complete, 1 Peter ii. 22. — 3. 
Wrought out in the room and stead of 
iiis people, Rom. x. 4. Rom. v. 19. — 
4. Well pleasing and acceptal)le in the 
sight of God. See Atonement ; Death

OBLATI, secular persons who de- 
voted themselves and their estates to 
some monastery, into which they were 
admitted as a kind of lay-brothers. The 
form of their admission was putting the 
bell-ropes of the chui-ch round tljeir 
necks, as a mark of servitude. They 
wore a religious habit, but different from 
that of the monks. 



OBLIGATION is that by which we 
are bound to the performance of any ac- 
tion, 1. Rational obligation is that which 
arises from reason, abstractly taken, to 
do or forbear certain actions. — 2. Jlu- 
thoritative obligation is that which arises 
from the commands of a superior, or one 
who has a right or authority to prescribe 
rules to others. — 3. Moral obligation is 
that by which we ai-e bound to peiform 
that which is right, and to a\oid that 
which is wrong. It is a moral necessity 
of doing actions or forbearing them ; 
that is, such a necessity as whoever 
breaks through it, is, ijiso facto, worthy 
of blame for so doing. Various, howe\'er, 
have been the opinions concerning the 
ground of moral obligation, or what it 
arises from. One says, from the moral 
fitness of things; another, because it is 
conformable to i-eason and nature ; ano- 
ther, because it is conformable to tnith ; 
and another, because it is expedient, and 
promotes the public good. A late writer 
has defined obligation to be " a state of 
mind perceiving the reasons for acting, 
or forbearing- to act." But I confess 
this has a difficulty in it to me ; because 
it carries with it an idea that if a man 
should by his hal:)itual practice of iniqui- 
ty be so hardened as to lose a sense of 
duty, and not perceive the reasons why 
he should act morall)', then he is under 
no obligation. And thus a depraved 
man might say he is under no obligation 
to obey the laws of the land, because, 
through his desire of living a licentious 
life, he is led to suppose that there 
should be none. In my opinion, a dif- 
ference should be made between obliga- 
tion and a se)ise of it. Moral obligation, 
I think, arises from the will of God, as 
revealed in the light and law of nature, 
and in his word. This is binding upon 
all men, because there is no situation in 
which mankind have not either one or 
tlie other of these. \^'^e find, however, 
tluit the generality, of men are so far 
sunk in depravity, that a sense of obli- 
gation is nearly or quite lost. Still, how- 
ever, their losing the Sense does not ren- 
der the obligation less strong. " Obli- 
gation to virtue is eternal and immuta- 
i)le, but the sense of it is lost by sin."

noise in Europe, and are generally sup- 
posed to have been unfriendly to reli- 
gion. The founder of this sect was Dr. 
Duquesnoi, who had so well insinuated 
himself .into the favour of Louis XV. 
that the king used to call him his Think- 
er. The sect was called JEcoJio mists, 
because the economy and order to be 
introduced into the finances, and other 
means of alleviating the distresses of 
the people, were perpetually in their 
mouths. The abbe Bariiiel admits that 
there may have been some few of them 
who directed their speculations to no 
other object ; but he brings very suffi- 
cient proof that the aim of the majority 
of the sect was to distribute the wri- 
tings of Voltaire, Diderot, and others, 
and thus to eradicate from the minds 
of the people all re^'erence for divme 
revelation. See Philosophists.

OMEN is a word which, in its pro- 
per sense, signifies a sign or indication 
of some future event, especially of an 
alarming nature. Against the behef 
of omens it is observed, that it is con- 
trary to every principle of sound phi- 
losophy ; and whoever has studied the 
writings of St. Paul must be convinced 
that it is inconsistent with the spirit of 
genuine Christianity. We cannot pre- 
tend to discuss the subject here, but 
will present the reader with a quota- 
tion on the other side of the question. 
"Though it be true," says Mr. Toplady, 
" that all omens are not worthy of ob- 
servation, and though they should never 
be so regarded as to shocli. our fortitude, 
or diminish our confidence in God, still 
they ai-e not to be constantly despised. 
Small incidents have sometimes been 
prelusive to great events ; nor is there 
any superstition in noticing these appa- 
rent prognostications, though there may 
be much superstition in being either too 
indiscriminately or too deeply swayed 
by \hQm.''—Tofilady^i Worlds, vol. iv.

OMNIPOTENCE OF GOD is his 

almighty pwwer. This is essential to 
his nature as an infinite, independent, 
and perfect being. The power of God 
is divided into absolute, and 07'dinate or 
actual. Absolute, is that whereby God 
is able to do that Avhich he will not do, 
but is possible to be done. Ordinate is 
that whereby he doeth that wliich he 
hath decreed to do. The power of God 
may be more especially seen, 1. In cre- 
ation, Rom. i. 20. Genesis i. — 2. In the 
preser\ ation of his creatures, Heb. i. 3. 
Col. i. 16, 17. Job XX vi. — 3. In the re-

success of the Gospel in the world.

se \erance of the saints, 1 Pet. i. 5. — 7.

OxMNIPRESENCE OF GOD, is 
his ubiquity, or his being present in 
every place. This may be argued from 
his infinity, Ps. cxxxix. his power, 
wliich is every where, Heb. i. 3; his 
providence. Acts xvii. 27, 28. which 
supplies all. As he is a spirit, he is so 
omnipresent as not to be mixed with 
the creature, or divided, part in one 
place, and part in another ; nor is he mul- 
tiplied or extended, but is essentially 
present every where. From the conside- 
ration of this attribute we should Team to 
fear and reverence God, Psal. 1-xxxix. 
7. To derive consolation in the hour of 
distress, Is. xliii. 2.Ps. xlvi. 1. To be ac- 
tive and diligent in holy services, Psal. "

OPINION is that judgment which 
the mind forms of any proposition, for 
the truth or falsehood of which there is 
not sufficient evidence to produce abso- 
lute belief. 

ORACLE, among the Heathens, was 
the answer wliich the gods were sup- 
posed to give to those who consulted 
them upon any affair of importance. 
It is. also used for the god who was 
thought to give the answer, and for 
the space where it was given. Learn- 
ed men are much divided as to the source 
of these oracles. Some suppose that 
tliey were only the invention of priests ; 
while others conceive that there was a 
diabolical agency employed in the busi- 
ness. There are, as one observes, se- 
veral circumstances leading to the for- 
mer hypothesis : such as the gloomy so- 
lemnity with which many of them were 
delivered in caves and subterraneous 
caverns : the numerous and disagi-eea- 
ble ceremonies enjoined, as sometimes 
sleeping in the skins of beasts, bathing, 
and expensive sacrifices ; the ambigu- 
ous and unsatisfactory answers fre- 
quently returned : these look very much 
like the contrivances of artful priests to 
. disguise their villany ; the medium of 
priests, speaking images, vocal groves, 
&amp;c. seem much to confirm it. On the 
other hand, if we may credit the rela- 
tion of ancient writers, either among 
Heathens or Christians, this hypothesis 
will hardly account for many of the in- 
stances they mention. And since it can- 
not be proved either impossible or un- 
scriptural, is it not pi-obable that God 
sometimes pei*mits an intercourse with 
infernal spirits, with a design, in the 
end, to turn this and every other cir- 
cumstance to his own glory ? 

Respecting the cessation of these ora- 
cles, there have been a variety of opi- 
nions. It has been generally held, in- 
deed, that oracles ceased at the birth of 
Jesus Christ : yet some have endeavour- 
ed to maintain the contrary, bv show- 



ing that they were in being in the days 
of Julian, commonly called (he a/iosiate, 
and that this emperor himself consulted 
them; nay, farther, say they, histoiy 
makes mention of several laws publish- 
ed by the Christian emperors, Theodo- 
sius, Gratian, and Valentinian, to punish 
persons who interrogated them, even in 
their days; and that the Epicureans 
were the first who made a jest of this 
superstition, and exposed the rogueiy 
of its priests to the people. 

But on the other side it is observed, 
1. That the question, properly stated, is 
not. Whether oracles became extinct 
immediately ujion the birth of Christ, or 
from the very moment he was born ; 
but, Whether they fell gradually into 
disesteein, and ceased as Christ and his 
Gospel became known to mankind? 
And that they did so is most certain 
from the concurrent testimonies of the 
fathers, which whoever would endea- 
vour to invalidate, may equally give up 
the most respectable traditions and re- 
lations of every kind. 

2dly, But did not Julian the apostate 
consult these oracles ? We answer in 
the negative : he had, indeed, recourse 
to magical operations, but it was because 
oracles had already ceased ; for he be- 
wailed the loss of them, and assigned 
pitiful reasons for it ; which St. Cyril 
has vigorously refuted, saying, that he 
never could have offered such, but from 
an unwillingness to acknowledge, that, 
when the world had received the light of 
Christ, the dominion of the devil was at 
an end. 

3dly, The Christian emperors do, in- 
deed, seem to condemn the superstition 
and idolatry of those who were still for 
consulting oracles ; but the edicts of 
those princes do not prove that oracles 
actually existed in their times, any 
more than that they ceased in conse- 
quence of their laws. It is certain that 
they were for the most part extinct be- 
fore the conversion of Constantine. 

4thly, Some Epicureans might make 
a jest of this sujierstition ; however, the 
Epicurean philosopher Celsus, in the 
second century of the church, was for 
crying up the excellency of sevei-al ora- 
cles, as appears at large irom Origen's 
seventh book against him. 

Among the Jews there were several 
sorts of real oracles. They had, first, 
oracles that were delivered viva voce ; 
as when God spake to Moses face to 
face, and as one friend speaks to ano- 
ther. Numb. xii. 8. Secondly, Prophe- 
tical dreams sent by God ; as the dreams 
which God sent to Joseph,*and whicli 
foretold his future greatness. Gen. xxviis

S, 6. Thirdly, Visions ; as when a pro- 
phet in an ecstacj', being neither proper- 
ly asleep nor awake, had supernatural 
revelations, Gen. xv. 1. Gen. xlvi. 2. 
Fourthly, The oracle of the Urim and 
Thummim,. which was accompanied 
with the ephod, or the pectoral worn by 
the high priest, and which God had en- 
dued with the gift of foretelling things 
to come^Numb. xii. 6. Joel. ii. 28. This 
manner of inquiring of the Lord was of- 
ten made use of, from Joshua's time to 
the erection of the temple at Jerusa- 
lem. Fifthly, After the building of the 
temple, thev generally consulted the 

Erophets, who were frequent in the 
ingdoms of Judah and Israel. Fi-om 
Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, who 
are the last of the prophets that have 
anv of their writings remaining, the 
Jews pretend that God gave them what 
they call Bath/col, the Daughter of 
the Voice, which was a supernatural 
manifestation of the will of God, which 
■was performed either by a sti-ong in- 
spiration or internal voice, or else by a 
sensible and external voice, which was 
heard by a number of persons sufficient 
to bear testimony of it. For example, 
such was the voice that was heard at the 
baptism of Jesus Christ, saying. This is 
my beloved Son, &amp;c. Matt. iii. 17. 

The scripture affords us examples 
likewise of profane oracles. Balaam, at 
the instigation of his own spirit, ajid 
urged on by his avai-ice, fearing to lose 
the recompence that he was promised 
by Balak, king of the Moabites, suggests 
a diabolical expedient to this prince of 
making the Israelites fall into idolatry 
and fornication, (Numb. xxiv. 14. Numb, 
xxxi. 16.) by which he assures him of a 
certain victory, or at least of considera- 
ble advantage against the people of 
God. 

Micaiah, the son of Imlah, a propliet 
of the Lord, says (1 Kings xxii. 20, 
&amp;c.) that he saw the Almighty, sitting 
upon his throne, and all the host of hea- 
ven round about him ; and the Lord said, 
|Who shall tempt Ahab, king of Israel, 
that he may go to war with Ramoth 
Gilead, and fall in the battle ? One an- 
swered after one manner, and another 
in another. At the same time an evU 
spirit presented himself before the Lord, 
and said, I will seduce him. And the 
Lork asked him, How f To which Sa- 
tan answered, I will go and be a lying 
spirit in the moutli of his prophets. And 
the Lord said, Go, and thou shalt pre- 
vail. This dialogue clearly proves these 
two thuigs ; jfint, that the devil could do 
nothing by his own power ; and, second- 
/v, that, with the permission of God, he 



could inspire the false prophets, sorcer* 
ers, and magicians, and make them de 
liver false oracles. See Vandale and

ORATORY, a name given by Chris- 
tians to certain places ot religious wor- 
ship. 

In ecclesiastical antiquity, the term 
omci fuxTnyioi, houses of pi'aver, or ora- 
tories, is frequently given to churches 
in general, of which there are innumera- 
ble instances in ancient Christian writers. 
But in some canons the name oratory 
seems confined to private chapels or 
places of worship set up for the conve- 
nience of private families, yet still de- 
pending on the parochial churches, and 
differing from them in this, that they 
were only places of prayer, but not for 
celebratuig the comnmnion ; for if that 
were at any time allowed to private fa- 
niilics, yet, at least, upon the great and 
solemn festivals, they were to resort for 
communion to the parish churches. 

Orafoi-y is used among the Romanists 
for a closet, or little apartment near a 
bed-chamber, furnished with a little al- 
tar, cinicifix, &amp;c. for private devotion. 

Oratory, Priests of the. There were 
two congregations of i-eligious, one m 
Italy, the other in France, which were 
called by his name. 

The Priests of the Oratory in Italy 
had for their founder, St. Philip de Ner'i, 
a native of Florence, who, in the year 
1548, founded at Rome the Confrater- 
nity of the Holy Trinity. This Society 
originally consisted of but fifteen poor 
persons, who assembled in the church 
of St. Saviour, in camfio, every first 
Sunday in the month, to practise the ex- 
ercises of piety described by the holy 
foundei'. Afterwards their number hi- . 
ci'easing by the addition of several per- 
sons of distinction to tlie society, St. 
Philip proceeded to establish a hospital 
for the reception of poor pilgrims, who, 
coming to Rome to visit the tombs of 
St. Peter and St. Paul, were obliged, for 
want of a lodging, to lie in the stieets, 
and at the doors of churches. For this 
charitable purpose, pope Paul I\ . gave 
to the society the parochial church of 
St. Benedict, close by which was built 
a hospital, so large, that in the Jubilee 
year 1600, it received 444,500 men, and 
25,500 women, who came in pilgrimage 
to Rome.

were established o» the model of those 
in Italy, and owe theh' rise to cardinal 
Berulle, a native of Champagne, who 
resolved upon this foundation in order to 
revive the splendour of the ecclesiastical 
state, whicn was greatly sunk, through 
the miseries of the civil wars, the in- 
crease of heresies, and a general cor- 
ruption of manners. To this end he as- 
sembled a community of ecclesiastics, 
in 1611, in the suburb of St. James. 
They obtained the king's letter patent 
for their establishment; and, in 1613, 
pope Paul V. approved this congrega- 
tion, under the title of the Oratory of 
Jesus. 

This congregation consisted of two 
sorts of persons ; the one, as it were, in- 
corporated ; the other only associates : 
the former governed the houses of this 
institute ; the latter were only employed 
in forming themselves to the life and 
manners of ecclesiastics. And this was 
the tnie spirit of this congregation, in 
which they taught neither human learn- 
ing nor theology, but only the virtues of 
the ecclesiastical life. 

ORDER, method; the established 
manner of performing a thing. Nothing 
c;m be more beautiful in religion and 
morals than order. The neglect of it 
exposes us to the inroads of vice, and 
often brings upon us the most peiplex- 
ing events. Whether we consider it in 
reference to ourselves, our familks, or 
the church, it is of the greatest impor- 
tance. As to the first, order should be 
attended to as it respects our principles, 
Heb. xiii. 9. James i. 8 : our tempers, 
Prov. xvii. 14. Eph. iv. 31 ; our con- 
versation. Col. iv. 6 ; our business, Prov. 
xxii. 29; our time, Ps. xc. 12. Eccl. iii. 
1 ; our recreations ; and our general 
conduct, Phil. i. 27. 2 Pet. i. 5, &amp;c.— 
2. As it regards our families, there 
should be order ; as to the economy or 
management of its concerns. Matt. xii. 
25 ; as to devotion, and the time of it, 
Jos. xxiv. 15 ; as to the instruction 
thei'eof, Eph. vi. 1. Gen. xviii. 19. 2 
Tim. i. 5. — 3. In resfiect to the church, 
order should be observed as to the ad- 
mission of members, 2 Cor. vi. 15 ; as 
to the administration of its ordinances, 
1 Cor. xiv. 33, 40 ; as to the attendance 
on its worship, Ps. xxvii. 4 ; as to our 
behaviour therein. Col. i. 10. Matt. v. 
16. To excite us to the practice of this 
duty, we should consider that God is a 
God of order, 1 Cor. xiv. 33 ; his works 
are all in the exactest order, Eph. i. 11. 
Psalm, civ. 25. Eccl. iii. 11 ; heaven is a 
place of order, Rev. vii. 9. Jesus Christ 
was a most beautiful example of regu- 
larity. The advantages of order are 



nuniprous. " Tlie observance of it," says 
Dr. Blair, " serves to correct that negli- 
gence which makes us omit some duties, 
and that hurry and precipitancy which 
makes us pei-form others imperfectly. 
Our attention is thereby directed to its

path which Providence has pointed out 
to us ; in the couree of which all the dif- 
ferent business of life presents itself re- 
gularly to us on every side. Ser. vol. ii.

ORDERS, by way of eminency, or 
holy orders, denote a character peculiar 
to ecclesiastics, whereby they are set 
apart for the ministry. This the Ro- 
manists make their sixth sacrament. In 
no reformed church are there more than 
three orders, ^ iz. bishops, priests, and 
deacons. In the Romish church there 
are seven, exclusive of the episcopate ; 
all which the council of Trent enjoins 
to be received and believed on pain of 
anathema. They are distinguished into 
petty or secular orders, and major or 
sacred orders. Orders, the petty or mi- 
nor, are four, viz. those of door-keep- 
ers, exorcist, reader, and acolyth. Sa- 
cred, or major, are deacon, priest, and 
bishop. 

ORDERS, RELIGIOUS, are con- 
gregations or societies of monasteries 
living under the same superior, in the 
same mannei', and wearing the same 
habit. Religious orders may be reduced 
to five kinds, viz. monks, canons, knights, 
mendicants, and regular clerks. White 
order denotes the order of I'egular 
canons, of St. Augixstine. Black order 
denotes the order of St. Benedict. Or- 
ders religious militarnf are those insti- 
tuted m defence of the faith, and pri- 
vileged to say. mass, and who are pi'o- 
hibited marriage, &amp;c. Of this kind are 
the knights of Malta, or of St. John of 
Jerusalem. Such also were the knights 
templars, the knights of Calatrave, of 
St. Lazanis, Teutonic knights, 8cc. 

ORDINANCES OF THE GOS- 
PEL, are institutions of divine authority 
relating to the worship of God; such 
as baptism. Matt, xxviii. 19. — 2. The 
Lord's supper, 1 Cor. xi. 24, &amp;c. — 
3. Public ministry, or preaching and 
reading the word, Rom. x. 15. Eph. iv. 
13. Mark, xvi. 15. — i. Hearing the Gos- 
pel, Mark, iv. 24. Rom. x. 17.— 5. Pub- 
lic prayer, 1 Cor. xvi. 15, 19. Matt. vi. 
6. Psal. V. 1, 7. — 6. Singing of psalms. 
Col. iii. 16. Eph. v. 19. — 7. Fasting, James 
iv. 9. Matt. ix. 15. Joel ii. 12.— 8. So-

ORDINATION, the act of confer-

ORD 



Tsng holy orders, or of initiating a person 
into the priesthood by prayer and the 
laying on of hands. Among the Dissen- 
ters, ordination is the pubhc setting apart 
of a minister to his work, or over the 
people whose call he has accepted. In 
the church of England, ordination has 
always been esteemed the principal 
prerogati^ e of bishops, and they still re- 
tain the function as a mark of tlieir spi- 
ritual sovereignty in their diocess. With- 
out ordination no person can receive any 
benefice, parsonage, vicarage, &amp;c. A 
person must be twenty-three years of 
age, or near it, before he can be ordain- 
ed deacon, or have anj' share in the mi- 
mstry; and full twenty-four before he 
can be ordained priest, and by that 
means be permitted to administer the 
holy communion. A bishop, on the or- 
dination of clergymen, is to examine 
them in the presence of the ministers, 
who in the ordination of priests, but not 
of deacons, assist him at the imposition 
of hands ; but this is only done as a mark 
of assent, not because it is thought ne- 
cessary. In case anj- crime, as dninken- 
ness, perjury, forger)^, &amp;c. is alleged 
against any one that is to be ordained 
either priest or deacon, the bishop ought 
to desist from ordaining him. The per- 
son to be ordamed is to bring a testmio- 
nial of his life and doctrine to the bi- 
shop, and to give account of his faith in 
Latm ; and both priests and deacons ai-e 
obliged to subscribe to the thirty-nine 
articles. In tlie ancient discipline there 
was no such thing as a vague and abso- 
lute ordination; but every one was to 
have a church, whereof he was to be 
ordained clerk or priest. In tlie twelftli 
century they grew more remiss, and or- 
dained' without any title or benefice. 
The council of Trent, however, re- 
stored the ancient discipline, and ap- 
pointed that none should be ordained 
but those who were provided with a be- 
nefice; which practice still obtains m 
England. The times of ordination are 
the fo\u- Sundays immediately following 
the Ember weeks; being the second 
Sunday in Lent, Trinity Simday, and the 
Simdavs following the first Wednesday 
after September 14 and December 13. 
These are the stated tin)es ; but ordi- 
nation may take place at any other time, 
according to tlie discretion of the bi- 
shop, or circumstances of the case. 
Among Seceders or Dissenters, ordina- 
tions vary. In the establishment of 
Scotland, where there are no bishops, 
the power of ordination is lodged in the 
presbytery. Among the Calvinistic Me- 
thodists, ordination is perfonned by the 
sanction and assistance of their own mi- 



nisters. Among the Independents an4 
Baptists, the power of ordination lies in 
the suffrage of the people. Tlie quali- 
fications of the candidates are first 
known, tried, and approved by the 
church. After which trial, the church 
proceeds to give him a call to be their 
minister; which he accepting, the pub- 
lic acknowledgment thereof is signified 
by ordination, the mode of wliich is so 
well known, as not to need recital here. 

Though the Dissenters practice ordi- 
nation, we find they are not agreed I'e- 
sjiecting it. Some contend for the power 
of ordination as belonging to the people ; 
the exercise of which right by them con 
stitutes a minister, and confers validity 
on his public ministrations. Others sup- 
pose it belongs to those who are already 
in office. \Vlthout pretending to deter- 
mine the question, we shall here give an 
outline of the arguments on both sides. 

Accorduig to tlie former opinion, it is 
argued that the word ordain was ori- 
ginally equal to choose or appoint; so 
that if twenty Christians nominated a 
man to instruct them once, the man was 
appointed or ordained a preacher for 
the time. The essence of ordbiation 
lies in the voluntary choice and call of 
the people, and in the voluntary accep- 
tance of that call by the person chosen 
and called; for this affair must be by- 
mutual consent and agi-eement, whicn 
joins them together as pastor and peo- 
ple. And this is to be done among them- 
selves; and public ordination, so called, 
is no other than a declaration of that. 
Election and ordination are spoken of as 
the same; the latter is expressed and 
explained by the former. It is said of 
Christ, that he ordained twelve, Mark 
iii. 14. that is, he chose them to the of- 
fice' of apostleship, as he himself ex- 
plains it, John vi. 70. Paul and Barna- 
bas are said to ordain elders in every 
church (Acts xiv. 23.) or to choose 
them ; that is, they gave orders and di- 
rections to every church as to the choice 
of elders over them : for sometimes per- 
sons are said to do that which they give 
orders and directions for doing ; as Mo- 
ses and Solomon, with respect to build- 
ing the tabernacle and temple, though 
done by others; and Moses pjirlicularly 
is said to choose the judges, Exod. xviii. 
25. the choice being made under his di- 
rection and guidance. Tlie word that 
is used in Acts xiv. 23. is translated 
chosen in Cor. ii. 8, 19. where the apos- 
tie speaks of a brother, xfijoTovn^Eis. who 
was chosen of the churches to travel 
with us, and is so rendered when ascribed 
to God, Acts X. 41. This choice and 
ordination, in primitive times, was made

two ways; by casting lots and giving 
votes, signified by stretching out of 
hands. Matthias was chosen and or- 
dained to be an apostle in the room of 
Judas by casting lots : that being an ex- 
traordinary office, required an imme- 
diate interposition of the Divine Being, 
a lot being nothing more nor less than an 
appeal to God for the decision of an af- 
fair. But ordinaiy officers, as elders 
and pastors of churches, were chosen 
and ordamed by the votes of the peo- 

Ele, expi'cssed by stretching out their 
ands ; thus it is said of the apostles. Acts 
xiv. 23. When they had ordained them 
elders in every- church, x^f^TovxtravTEs, 
by taking the siaffrages and votes of the 
members of the churches, shown by the 
stretching out of their hands, as the 
word signifies; and which they direct- 
ed them to, and upon it declared the 
elders duly elected and ordained. 

Some, however, on this side of the 
question, do not go so far as to say, that 
the essence of ordination lies m the 
choice of the people, but in the solemn 
r-ind }i ublic separation to office h\ prayer : 
still, how'ever, they think that ordina- 
tion by either bishops, presbyters, or any 
superior character, cannot be necessary 
to make a mmister or ordain a pastor in 
any particular church ; for Jesus Chi'ist, 
say they, would never leave the sub- 
aistence of his churches, or the efficacy 
of his word and sacraments, to depend 
on the uninterrupted succession oi any 
office or oflicer: for then it would be 
impossible for any church to know 
whether they ever have had any au- 
thentic minister ; for we could never be 
assui'ed that such ordinations had been 
i'ightly transmitted through 1700 years. 
A whole nation might be corrupted, and 
every bishop and elder therein might 
have' apostatized from the faith, as it 
was in England in the days of popeiy. 
To say, therefore, tliat the right of or- 
daining lies in men who are already in 
office, would drive us to hold the above- 
mentioned imtenable position of uninter- 
rupted succession. 

On the other side it is obsei'ved, that, 
although Christians have the liberty of 
choosing their own pastor, yet they have 
iio power or riglit to confer the office it- 
raclt. Scripture represents ordination to 
be the setting apart of a person to the 
iioly ministry, by the authority of Jesus 
himself acting by the medium^ of men in 
office ; and this solemn investing act is 
necessary to his being lawfully account- 
''?d a minister of Christ. The original 
word. Acts vi. 3. is jiarao-TticrcoiJitv, which 
according to Scapula, and the best 
ATiters on the sacred language, signifies 



to put one in rule, or to give hLra au- 
thority. Now did this power lodge in 
the people, how happens it that in all 
the epistles, not a single word is to be 
found giving them any directions about 
constituting minister's ? On the other 
hand, in the epistles to Timothy and 
Titus, who were persons in office, we 
find particular instnictions given th'em 
to lay hands suddenly on no man, to ex- 
amine his qualifications before they or- 
dain him, and to take care that they 
commit the office only to faithful men, 
who shall be able to teach others also, 
Titus i. 5. 2 Tim. iv. 14. Acts xiv. 23. 

Besides, it is said, the primitive Chris- 
tians evidently viewed this matter in the 
same light. There is scarcely a smgle 
ecclesiastical writer that does not ex- 
pressly mention ordination as the work 
of the elders, and as being regarded as a 
distinct thing from the choice of the 
people, and subsequent to it. 

Most of the foregoing remarks apply 
chieily to the supposition, that a person 
cannot be oi"dained in any other way 
than as a pastor over a church. But 
here, also, we find a difference of 
opinion. On the one side it is said, that 
there is no Scripture authority what- 
ever for a person being ordained with- 
out being chosen or nominated to the 
office of a minister by a church. Elders 
and bishops were ordained in every 
church, not without any church. To 
ordain a man originally, says Dr. 
Campbell, was nothing else but in a 
solemn manner to assign him a pastoral 
charge. To give him no charge, and 
not to ordain him, were perfectly iden- 
tical. On the other side it is con- 
tended, that from these words, " Go ye 
into all the world, and preach the Gosr 
pel to every creature; and, lo, I am 
with you always, even unto the end of 
the world," it is evident that missiona- 
ries and itinerants must be employed in 
the important work of the ministry; 
that, as such cannot be ordained over 
any particular church, there cannot be 
the least impropriety in ordaining them 
for the church universal. Allowing 
that they have all those talents, gifts, 
and grace, that constitute a minister in 
the sight of God, who will dare say 
they should not 1)e designated by their 
brethren for the administration of those 
ordinances Christ has appointed in the 
church? — W'ithout allowing this, how 
many thousands would be destitute of 
these ordinances ? Besides, these are the 
very men whom God in general honours 
as the first instruments in raising 
cliurches, over which stated pastors are 
afterwards fixed. The separation of

Saul and Barnabas, say they, was an or- 
dination to missionary work, including 
the administration of sacraments to the 
converted Heathen, as well as public 
insti-uction, Acts xiii. 1, 3. So Timotliy 
was oi-dained, 1 Tim. iv. 14. Acts xvi. 
!?, and there is equal reason, by analogy, 
to suppose, that Titus and other com- 
panions of Paul wei-e similaily ordain- 
ed, without any of them having a par- 
ticular church to take under his pasto- 
ral care. . So that they appear to have 
been ordained to the work of the Chris- 
tian mmistry at large. 

On reviewing the whole of this con- 
troversy, I would say with Dr. Watts, 
♦' that since there are some texts in the 
New Testament, wherein single per- 
sons, either apostles, as Paul and Bar- 
nabas, oixlained ministei"s in the church- 
es; or evangelists, as Timothy and 
Titus ; and since other missions or or- 
dinations arc intimated to be perfomi- 
cd by several persons, viz. prophets, 
teachers, elders, or a presbyteiy, as ui 
Acts xiii. 1. and 1 Tim. iv. 14; since 
there is sometimes mention made of the 
imposition of hands in the mission of a 
minister, and sometimes no mention of 
it ; and since it is evident that in some 
cases popular ordinations are and must 
be valid without any bishop or elder; 
I think none of these difterences should 
be made a matter of violent contest 
among Christians; nor ought any words 
to be pixjuounced against each other by 
those of the episcopal, presbyterian, or 
independent way. Surely, all may 
agree thus far, that various forms or 
modes, seeming to be used in the mis- 
sion or ordination of ministers hi primi- 
tive times, may give a reasonable occa- 
sion or colour for sincere and honest 
searchers after truth to follow different 
opmions on this head, and do thei-efoi'e 
demand our candid and charitable sen- 
timents concerning those who differ 
from us." See articles Episcopacy,

ORIGENISTS. a denomination which 



appeared in the third centun,-, who de- 
ri\ed their opinions from the writings 
of Origen, a presbyter of Alexandria, 
and a man of vast and uncommon abili- 
ties, who intei-preted the divine ti-uths 
of religion according to the tenor of the 
Platonic philosophy. He alleged, that 
the source of man}- evils lies in adhering 
to the literal and external part of Scrip- 
ture: and that the trae meaning of the 
sacred writere was to be sought in a 
mysterious and hidden sense, ai'ising 
from the nature of things themselves. 

I'he pi'incipal tenets ascribed to Ori- 
gen, together with a few of the rea- 
sons in^de use of in their defence, are 
comprehended m the following sum- 
mary : — 

1.' That there is a pre-exist ent state 
of human souls. For the nature of the 
soul is such as to make her capable of 
existing eternally, backward as well 
as forwaixl, because her spii'itual es- 
sence, as such, makes it impossible that 
she should, either through age or vio- 
lence, be dissolved: so that nothing is 
Avanting to her existence but the good 
pleasure of him from whom all things 
proceed. And \i, according to the Pla- 
tonic scheme, we assign the production 
of all things to the exuberant fulness of 
life in the Deity, which, throu.^h the 
blessed necessity of his communicative 
nature, empties itself into all possibili- 
ties of being, as into so many capable 
receptacles, we must suppose her exis- 
tence in a sense necessary, and in a de- 
gree co-cternal with God'. 

2. That souls were condemned to ani- 
mate mortal bodies, in order to expiate 
faults they had committed in a pre- 
existent state : for we may be assured, 
from the infinite'goodness of their Crea- 
tor, that they were at first joined to the 
purest mattei', and placed m those re- 
gions of the universe which were most 
suitable to the purity of essence they 
then possessed. For that the souls oj 
men are an order of essentially incorpo- 
rate spirits, their deep immersion into 
terrestrial matter, the modification of 
all their opei-ations by it, and the hea- 
venly body promised in the Gospel, as 
the highest perfection of our renewed 
nature, clearly evince. Therefore if 
our souls existed before they appeared 
inhabitants of the earth, they were 
placed in a purer ekment, and enjoyed 
far gi-eater degrees of happiness. And 
certainly he, whose overnowing good- 
ness brought them into existence, would 
not deprive them of their felicity, till by 
their mutability they rendered them- 
selves less pure in the whole extent of 
their powers, and "became disposed for

tlie susception of such a degree of cor- 
poreal life as was exactly answerable to 
their present disposition of spii'it. Hence 
it was necessary that they should be- 
come terrestrial men. 

3. Tliat the soul of Christ was united 
to the Word before the incarnation. For 
the Scriptures teach us that the soul of 
the Messiah was created before the 
beginning of the world, Phil. ii. 5, 7. 
This text must be understood of 
Christ's human soul, because it is 
unusual to propound the Deity as an ex- 
ample of humility in Scripture. Though 
the humanity of Christ was so God-like, 
he emptied himself of this fuhiess of 
life and glory, to take upon fiim the 
form of a seri'ant. It was this Messiah 
who cbn\ ersed with the patriarchs un- 
der a human form: it was he who ap- 
peared to Moses upon the Holy Movuit : 
It was he who spoke to the prophets 
vuider a ^ isible appearance ; and it is he 
who will at last come in triumph upon 
the clouds to restore the universe to its 
primitive splendour and felicity. 

4. That at the resuri-ection of the 
dead we sliall be clothed with ethereal 
bodies.. For the elements of our ter- 
restrial compositions ai'e such as almost 
fatally entangle us in vice, passion, and 
misery. The purer the vehicle the soul 
is united with, the more perfect is her 
life and operations. Besides, the Su- 
preme Goodness who made all things, 
assures us he made all things best at 
first, and therefore his recovery of us 
to our lost happiness (which is the de- 
sign of the Gospel,) must restore us to 
our better bodies and happier habita- 
tions, which is evident fi-om 1 Cor. xv. 
49. 2 Cor. V. 1. and other texts of 
Scripture. 

5. That, after long periods of time, 
the damned shall be released from their 
torments, and restored to a new state of 
probation. For the Deity has such re- 
serves in his graciotis providence, as 
Avill vindicate his sovereign goodness 
and wisdom from all disparagement. 
Expiatory pains are a part of his ado- 
rable plan ; for this sharper kind of fa- 
vour has a righteous place in such crea- 
tui'es as are by nature mutable. Though 
sin has extinguished or silenced the di- 
vine life, yet it has not destroyed the 
faculties of reason and understanding, 
consideration and memory, which will 
serve the life which is most powerful. 
If, therefore, the vigorous attraction of 
the sensual nature be abated by a cease- 
less pain, these powers may resume the 
seeds of a better life and nature. As in 
the material system there is a gravita- 
tion of the less bodies towards the great- 



er, there must of necessity be something 
analogous to this in the intellectual sys- 
tem ; and since the spirits created by 
God ai-e emanations and streams from 
his own abyss of being, and as self-ex- 
istent power must needs subject all be- 
ings to itself, the Deity could not but 
impress upon her intimate natures and 
substances a central tendency towards 
himself; an essential principle of re- 
union to their great original. 

6. That the earth after its conflagra- 
tion shall become habitable again, and 
be the mansion of men and animals, and 
that in eternal vicissitudes. For it is 
thus expressed in Isaiah: Behold I 
make 7iew heavens, and a new earth; 
&amp;c. and in Heb. i. 10, 12. Thou, Lord, 
in the beginning hast laid the founda- 
tions of the earth; as a vesture shalt 
thou change them, and they shall be 
changed, &amp;.c. Where there is only a 
change the substance is not destroyed, 
this change being only as that of a gar- 
ment worn out and decaying. The 
fashion of the world passes away like 
a turning scene, to exhibit a fresh and 
new representation of things; and if 
only the present dress and appearance 
of things go off, the substance is sup- 
posed to remain entire. 

ORIGINAL SIN. See Fall, Sin. 

ORIGIN OF EVIL. See Sin. 

ORTHODOXY, soundness of doc- 
trine or opuiion in matters of religion. 
The doctrines which are generally con- 
sidered as orthodox among us, are such 
as were generally professed at the time 
of the reformation, viz. the fall of man, 
regeneration, atonement, repentance, 
justification by free grace, &amp;c. 

Some have thought, that, in order to 
keep error out of the church, there 
should be some human fonn as a stan- 
dard of orthodoxy, wherein certain 
chsputed doctrines shall be expressed in 
such determinate phrases as may be di- 
rectly levelled against such errors as 
shall prevail from time to time, requii'ing 
those especially who are to be public 
teachers in the church to subscribe or 
virtually to declare their assent to such 
formularies. But as Dr. Doddridge ob- 
serves, 1. Had this been requisite, it is 
probable that the Scriptures would have 
gi\'en us some such formularies as these, 
or some directions as to the manner in 
which they should be drawn up, pro- 
posed, and received. — 2. It is impossi- 
ble that weak and passionate men, who 
have perhaps been heated in the very 
controversy thus decided, should ex- 
press themselves with greater propriety 
than the apostles did. — 3. It is plain, in 
fact, that this practice has been the 



PAC 



423 



PAC 



ca^ise of great contention in the Cliris- 
tian church, and such formularies have 
been tlie grand engine of dividing it, in 
proportion to the degree in whicli they 
nave been multiphed and urged. — 4. 
This is laying a great temptation in the 
way of such as desire to undeitake the 
office of teachers in the church, and 
will be most likely to deter and af- 
flict those who have the greatest ten- 
derness of conscience, and therefore 
{c£t fiar.) best deserve encourage- 
ment. — 5. It is not likely to answer the 
end proposed, viz. the preserving an 
uniformity of oi)inion, since persons of 
little integrity may satisfy their con- 
sciences, in subscribing what they do 
not at all believe as articles of fieace, or 
in putting the most unnatural sense on 
the words. And whereas, in answer to 
all these inconveniences, it is pleaded, 
that such forms are necessary to keep 
the church from heresy, and it is better 
thei'e should be some hypocrites under 
such forms of orthodoxy, than that a 
freedom of debate and opinion should 
be allowed to all teachers ; the answer 
is plain, that, when any one begins to 
preach docti'ines which appear to those 
who attend upon him dangerous and 
subversive of Christianity, it will be 
time enough to proceed to such animad- 
version as the nature of his error in 
their apprehension will require, and his 
relation to them will admit. See arti-

tion ; Doddridge's Lectures, lee.

OSIANDRIANS, a denomination 
among the Lutherans, which was 
founded in the vear 1550, by Andrew 
Osiander, a celebrated GeiTnan divine, 
whose doctrine amounted to the follow- 
ing propositions : — 

1. That Christ, considered in his hu- 
man nature only, could not, by his obe- 
dience to the divine law, obtain justifi- 
cation and pardon for sinners ; neither 
can we be justified before Ciod, by em- 
bracing and applying to ourselves, 
through faith, tlie righteousness and 
obedience of the man Christ. It is only 
through that eternal and essential righ- 
teousness wliich dwells in Christ, con- 
sidered as God, and which resides in his 
divine nature, that is united to the hu- 
man, that mankind can obtam complete 
justification. 

2. That a man becomes a partaker of 
this divine righteousness by faith, since 
it is in consequence of this uniting 
principle that Christ dwells in the heart 
of man with his divine righteousness. 
Now, wherever this divine righteous- 
ness dwells, there God can behold no 
sin ; therefore, when it is present with 
Chi-ist in the hearts of the regenerate, 
they are on its account considered by 
the Deity as righteous, although they 
be sinners. Moreover, this divine and 
justifying righteousness of Christ excites 
the faithfvd to the pursuit of holiness, 
and to the practice of virtue. 

OSSENIANS, a denomination of the 
first century, which taught that faith 
may and ought to be dissembled.

ti'oubles occasioned by their persecution. 
The first Edict of Pacification was 
granted by Charles IX. in January 
1562,' permitting the free exercise of 
the refoi-med religion near all the cities 
and towns of the realm. March 19, 
1563, the same king gi-anted a second 
Edict of Pacification, at Amboise, per- 
mitting the free exercise of the reform- 
ed religion in the houses of gentlemen 
and lords high justiciaries (or those who 
had the power of life and death,) to 
their families and dependents only ; 
and allowing other Protestants to have 
their sermons in such towns as they had 
them in before the seventh of March ; 



obliging them withal to quit the churches 
they had possessed themselves of during 
the troubles. Another, called the Jidict 
of Lonjunieaii, ordering the execution 
of that of Amboise, was published 
March 27, 1558, after a treaty of peace. 
This pacification was but of short con- 
tinuance ; for Charles perceiving a ge- 
neral insurrection of the Huguenots, re- 
voked the said edicts in September, 1568, 
forbidding the exercise of the Protestant 
religion, and commanding all_ the mi- 
nisters to depart the kingdom in fifteen 
days. But on the eighth of August, 1570, 
he' made peace with them again, and 
published an edict on the eleventh, 
allowing the lords high justiciaries to 
have sermons in their houses for all 
comers, and granting; other Protestantb

two public exercises in each govern- 
ment. He likewise gave tht-m four 
cautionary towns, vh. Rochelle, Alon- 
taubon, Cognal, and La Charite, to be 
places of security for them during the 
space of two years. 

Nevertheless, in August, 1572, he au- 
thorised the Bartholomew massacre, 
and at the same time issued a declara- 
tion, forbidding the exercise of the Pro- 
testant religion. 

Henry HI. in April, 1576, made peace 
with the Protestants; and the Edict of 
Pacification was published in parlia- 
ment, May 14, permitting them to build 
churches and have sermons where they 
pleased. The Guisian faction, enraged 
at this general libeity, began the famous 
league for defence of the Catholic re- 
ligion, which became so formidable, 
that it obhged the king to assemble the 
states of the kingdom at Blois, in De- 
cember, 1576, whei'e it was enacted 
that there should be but one religion m 
Fi-ance, and that the Protestant mi- 
nisters should be all banished. In 1577, 
the king, to pacify the troubles, publish- 
ed an edict in parliament, Octooer 8th, 
granting tlie same liberty to the reform- 
ed which they had before. However, 
in July 1585, the league obliged hirn to 
publish another edict, revoking all for- 
mer edicts granted to the Protestants, 
and ordering them to depart the king- 
dom in six months, or turn Papists. 
This edict was followed by more to the 
same purpose. 

Henry IV.. coming to the crown, pub- 
lished a declaration, July 4, 1591, abo- 
lishing the edicts against the Protestants. 
This edict was verified in the parlia- 
ment of Chalons ; but the troubles pre- 
vented the verification of it in the par- 
liaments of the other provinces ; so that 
the Protestants had not the free exer- 
cise of their religion in any place but 
\vhere they were masters, and had ba- 
nished the Romish religion. In April 
1598,1:he king published a new Edict of 
Pacification at Nantz, granting the Pro- 
testants the free exercise of their reli- 
gion in all places where they had the 
same in 1596 and 1597, and one exer- 
cise in each bailiwick. 

This Edict of JVantz was confirmed 
by Lewis XIII. in 1610, and by Lewis 
XIV. 1652. But the latter abolished it 
entirely in 1685. See IlLfGUENOTS, and 
Persecution. 

PiEDOBAPTISTS, those who bap- 
tise their children. The word comes 
from roatt, infant, and paffncxiics, baptism. 
See Baptism. 

PAGANISM, the religious worship 
suid discipline of Pagans, pr tiie adora- 



tion of idols and false gods. The 
theology of the Pagans according to 
themselves, as Scacvola and Vana, was 
of three sorts. The first of these may 
well be called fabulous, as treating of 
the theology and genealogy of their 
deities, in which they say such things 
as are unworthy of deiiy ; ascribing to 
them thefts, murders, adulteries, and 
all manner of crimes ; and therefore 
this kind of theology is condemned by 
the wiser sort of heathens as nugatory 
and scandalous : the writers of this soi't 
of theologj- were Sancho-niatho, the 
Phoenician ; and of the Grecians, Or- 
pheus, Hesiod, Pherecyde, &amp;c. The 
second sort, called physic, or natural, 
was studied and taught by the philoso* 
phers, who, rejecting the multiplicity of 
gods introduced by the poets, brought 
their theology to a more natural and ra- 
tional form, and supposed that there 
was but one Supreme God, which they 
commonly make to be the sun ; at least, 
an emblem of him, but at too great a 
distance to mind the alFairs of the world, 
and therefore de\'ised certain demons, 
which they considered as mediators be- 
tween the Supreme God and man ; and 
the docti'uies of these demons, to which 
the apostle is thought to allude in 1 
Tim. iv. 1. were what the philosophers 
had a concern with, and Avho treat of 
their nature, office, and regard to men ; 
as did Thales, Pythagoras, Plato, and 
the Stoics. The third part called fioli- 
tic, or civil, was instituted by legislators, 
statesmen, and politicians: the first 
among the Romans was Numa Pompi- 
lius ; this chiefly respected their gods, 
temples, altars, sacrifices, and rites of 
worship, and was properly their idola- 
try, the care of which belonged to the 
priests ; and this was enjoined the com- 
mon people, to keep them in obedience 
to the civil state. Thus things continued 
in the GentUe world, until the light of 
the Gospel was sent among them : the 
times before were times of ignorance, as 
the apostle calls them : they were igno- 
rant of the true God, and of the wor- 
ship of him ; and of the Messiah, and 
salvation by him. Their state is tinily 
described, Epli. ii. 12. that they were 
then ivithoiit Christ ; aliens from the 
commonwealth of Israel; strangers 
from the covenants of/iromise ; having 
no hofie, and without God in the world ; 
and, consequently, their theology was 
insufficient for their salvation. The 
reader will find some admirable reflec- 
tions on the growth of heathenism amon^ 
modern Christians, in the 3d volume ot 
the Rev. W. Jones's Works, See Hea- 
thens, Idolatry, Polytheism.

PANTHEISM, a philosophical spe- 
cies of idolatry, leadmg to atheism, in 
which the universe was considered as 
the Supreme God. Who was the in- 
ventor of this absurd system, is, per- 
haps, not known, but it was of early ori- 
gin, and differently modified by different 
philosophers. Some held the universe 
to be one immense animal, of which the 
incoi-poreal soul was properly their 
god, and the heavens and tlie earth the 
body of that god ; whilst others held 
but one substance, partly active and 
partly passive, and therefore looked 
upon the visible universe as the only 
Kumeyi. The earliest Grecian pan- 
theist of whom we read was Orpheus, 
who called the world the body of God, 
and its several parts his members, 
making the whole universe one divine 
animal. According to Cudworth, Or- 
pheus and his followers believed in the 
immaterial soul of the world: therein 
agreeing with Aristotle, who certainly 
held that God and matter are co-eter- 
nal ; and that there is some such union 
between them, as subsists between the 
souls and bodies of men. A^n institution, 
imbibing sentiments nearly of this kind, 
was set on foot about eighty or ninety 
years ago, in this kingdom, by a society 
of philosophical idolaters, who called 
themselves Pantheists, because they 
professed the worship of All Nature as 
their deity. They had Mr. John Toland 
for their secretary and chaplain. Their 
liturgy was in Latin : an English trans- 
lation was published in 1751, from which 
the foUowmg sentiments are extracted : 
— " The ethereal fire environs all 
things, and is therefore supreme. The 
aether is a reviving fire : it miles all 
things, it disposes all things. In it is 
soul, mind, pnidence. This fire is Ho- 
race's particle of divine breath, and 
Virgil's inwardly nourishing spirit. All 
things are comprised in an intelligent 
nature." This force they call the soul 
of the world ; as also, a mind of perfect 
wisdom, and, consequently, God. Vanini 
the Italian philosopher, was nearly of this 
opinion : his god was nature. Some very 
learned and excellent remarks are made 
on this error by Mr. Boyle, in his dis- 
course on the vulgarly received notion of 
nature. See Jones of JVayland^s Works, 
vol. ix. p. 50. and article Spixosism. 



PANTHEOLOGY, the whole sum 
or bodv of divinity. 

PAPIST, one who adheres to the 
communion of the pope and chui'ch of 
Rome. See Pope, and Popery. 

PARABLE, a fable or allegorical in- 
struction, founded on something real oi- 
apparent in nature or history, from 
which a moi'al is drawn, by comparing 
it with something in whicn the people 
are more immediately concerned : such 
are the parables of Dives and La- 
zarus, or the prodigal son, of the ten 
vir.^ins, &amp;c. Dr. Blair observes, that 
" oi parables, which form a part of al- 
legory", the prophetical writings are full ; 
and if to us they sometimes appear 
obscure, we must remember, that, in 
those early times, it was universally the 
mode throughout all the eastern na- 
tion.s, to convey saci*ed truths under 
some mysterious figures and represen- 
tations." 

PARACLETE, an advocate or com- 
forter ; generally applied to the third 
person in the Trinity, John xv. 26. 

PARADISE, the garden of Eden, in 
which Adam and Eve wei'e placed. It 
is also used to denote heaven, Luke 
xxiii. 44. As to the terrestrial para- 
dise, there have been many inquiries 
about its situation. It has been placed 
in the third heaven, in the orb of the 
moon, in the moon itself, in the middle 
region of the air, above the earth, under 
the eardi, in the place possessed by the 
Caspian sea, and under the arctic pole. 
The learned Huetius places it upon the 
river that is produced by the conjunction 
of the Tigris and Euphrates, now call- 
ed the river of the Arabs, between this 
conjunction, and the division made by 
the same river before it falls into the 
Persian sea. Other geographers have 
placed it in Armenia, between the 
sources of the Tigris, the Euphrates, 
the Araxes, and the Phasis, which they 
suppose to be the four rivers described 
by Moses. But concerning the exact 
place, we must necessarily be veiy un- 
certain, if, indeed, it can be thought at 
all to exist at present, considering the 
many changes which have taken place 
on the surface of the earth since the 
creation. See Man.

rcj.'vcscnts it b\' v;irious phrases: a 
lifting up, or taking away, Psal. xxxii. 
1; a covering of it, Psal. Ixxxv. 2; a 
non-imputation of it, Ps. xxxii. 2. a blot- 
ting it out, Ps. xliii. 25 ; a non-remem- 
brance of it, Heb.viii. 12. Is. xliii. 25. — 1. 
It is an act of free grace, Ps. li. 1. Isa. 
xliii. 25. — 2. A point of justice, God 
haA'ing received satisfaction by the blood 
of Christ, ] John i. 9. — 3. A complete 
act, a forgiveness of all the sins of his 
people, 1 John i. 7. Psal. ciii. 2, 3. — 4. 
An act that never will be repealed, 
Mic. vii. 19. The author or cause of 
pardon is not any creature, angel, or 
man; but God. Ministers are said to 
remit sin declaratively, but not autho- 
ritatively ; that is, they preach and de- 
clare that there is remission of sins in 
Christ ; but to pretend to absolve men 
is the height of blasphemy, 1 Thess. ii. 
4. Rev. xiii. 5, 6. See Absolution, 
Indulgences. There is nothing that 
man has, or can do, by which pardon 
can be procured: wealth cannot buy 
jjardon, Pro\ \ xi. 4 ; human works or 
righteousness cannot merit it, Rom. xi. 
6; nor can water baptism wash away 
sin. It is the prerogative of God alone 
to forgive, Mark ii. 7 ; the first cause 
of which is his own sovereign grace and 
mercy, Eph. i. 7. The meritorious 
cause is the blood of Christ, Heb. ix. 14. 
1 John i. 7. Pardon of sin and justifi- 
cation are considered by some as the 
same thing: and it nuist be confessed 
that there is a close connexion ; in 
n\any parts they agree, and it is without 
doubt that every sinner who shall be 
found pardoned at the great day, will 
likewise be justified ; 3'et they have 
been distingaished thus: 1. An innocent 
person, when falsely accused and ac- 
quitted, is justified, but not pardoned; 
and a criminal may be pardoned, though 
he cannot be justified or declared hino- 
cent. Pardon is of men that are sin- 
ners, and who remain such, thoiigh par- 
doned sinners ; but justification is a pro- 
nouncing persons righteous, as if they 
had nevei- sumed. — 2. Pardon frees from 
punishment, but does not entitle to 
everlasting life ; but justification does, 
Rom. V. If we -were only pai'doned, we 
should, indeed, escape the pains of hell, 
but could have no claim to the joys of 
heaven ; for these are more than the 
most perfect works of man could merit ; 
therefore they must be what the Scrip- 
tures declare — " the gift of God." 

After all, however, though these two 
may be distinguished, yet they cannot 
be separated; and, in reulity, one is not 
prior to the other ; for he that is par- 
doned by the death of Christ, is at the 



same time justified by his life, Rom. v, 
10. Acts xiii. 38, 39. See Grace, 
Mercy. Chartiock^s Works, vol. ii. p.

PARENTS, a naine appropriated to 
immediate progenitors, as father and 
mother. The duties of parents to chil- 
dren relate to their health, their main- 
tenance, their education, and morals. 
Many rules have been delivered re- 
specting the health of children, which 
cannot be inserted here ; yet we shall 
just observe, that if a parent wishes to 
see his progeny healthy, he n\ust not in- 
dulge them in every thing their little 
appetites desire; not give them too 
much sleep, nor ca er give them strong 
liquors. He nuist accustom them to in- 
dustry and moderate exercise. Their 
food and clothing should be rather light. 
They should go to rest soon, and rise 
early ; and, above all, should, if possible, 
be inspired with a love of cleanliness. 
As to their maintenance , it is the parent's 
duty to provide every thing for them 
that is necessary until they be capable 
of providing for themselves. They, 
therefore, who live in habits of idleness, 
desert their families, or by their negli- 
gent conduct reduce them to a state of 
indigence and distress, are A-iolating the 
law of nature and of revelation, 1 Tim. 
V. 8. In respect to their education and 
morals, great care should be taken. As 
it relates to the present life, habits of 
courage, application, trade, prudence, 
labour, justice, contentment, temper- 
ance, truth, benevolence, &amp;c. should 
be formed. Their capacities, age, tem- 
per, strength, inclination, should be 
consulted, and advice given suitable to 
these. As it relates to a future life, 
their minds slundd Ije informed as to the 
being of God, his perfections, glory, and 
the mode of salvation by Jesus Christ. 
They should be catechised ; allured to 
a cheerful attendance on divine wor- 
ship ; instructed in the Scriptures ; kept 
from bad company; prayed with and 
for ; and, above all, a good example set 
them, Prov. xxii. 6. Eph. vi. 1, 2. 
Nothuig can be more criminal than the 
conduct of some parents in the inferior 
classes of the community, who nevei- 
i"esti-ain the desires and passions of 
their childi'en, suffer them to live in 
idleness, dishonest)', and profanation of 
the Loi'd's day, the consequence of 
which is often an ignominious end. So, 
among the great, permitting their chil- 
dren to spend their time and their mo- 
ney as they please, indulging them in 
pei-petual public diveisions, and setting

before them awful examples of gamb- 
ling, indolence, blasphemy, drinking, 
and almost every other vice ; what is 
this but i-uining their children, and 
" bequeathing to posteritj^ a nuisance ?" 
But, while we would call upon parents 
to exercise their authority, it must 
not be understood that children are to 
be entirely at their disposal under all 
circumstances, especially when they be- 
gin to thmk for themselves. Though a 
parent has a right over his children, 
j'-et he is not to be a domestic tyrant, 
consulting his own will and passions in 
preference to their interest. In fact, 
his right OA'er them is at an end when 
he goes beyond his duty to them. " For 
parents," as Mr. Paley observes, " have 
no natural right over the lives of their 
children, as was absurdly allowed to 
Roman fathers ; nor any to exercise un- 
profitable severities ; nor to command 
the commission of crimes; for these 
rights can ne\'er be wanted for the pur- 
poses of a parent's duty. Nor have pa- 
rents any right to sell their children into 
slavery; to shut up daughters and 
younger sons in nunneries and monas- 
teries, in order to preserve' entire the 
estate and dignity of the family ; or to use 
any arts, either of kindness or unkind- 
ness, to induce them to make choice of 
this way of life themselves ; or in coun- 
tries where the clergy are prohibited 
from mari'iage, to put sons into the 
church for the same end, who are ne\'er 
likely to do or receive any good in it 
sufficient to compensate for this sacri- 
fice ; nor to urge children to marriages 
from which they are averse, with the 
view of exalting or enriching the family, 
or for the sake of connecting estates, 
parties, or interests ; nor to oppose a 
marriage in which the ckild would pro- 
bably find his happiness, from a motive 
of pride or avarice, of family hostility or 
personal jjique." Paley^s AIoraL Pki-

PARSIMONY, covetousness. See 

CovETOUSNESS. 

PARSON, {/lersona -ecclesite) one 
that hath full possession of all tlie rights 
of a parochial church. He is called 
*parson {fiersond) because by his per- 
' son the church, which is an invisible 
body, is represented, and he is in him- 
self a body corporate, in order to pro- 
tect and defend the rights of the cluircU, 
which he personates. There arc three 



ranks of clergymen below that of a dig- 
nitary, viz. parson, vicar, and curate. 
Purso)i is the first, meaning a rector, or 
he who receives the great tithes of a 
benefice. Clergymen may imply any 
person ordained to serve at the altar. 
Parsojis are always priests, whereas 
clergymen are only deacons. See Cler- 
gy, Curate.* 

PASAGINIANS, a denomination 
which arose in the twelfth century, 
known also by the name of the Circum- 
cised. Their distinguishing tenets were 
these, 1. That the observation of the 
law of Moses in every thuig except the 
offering of sacrifices was obligatory 
upon Christians. In consequence of 
which, they circumcised their followers, 
abstained from those meats the use of 
which was prohibited under the Mo- 
saic (Economy, and celebrated the Jew- 
ish sabbatli. — 2. That Christ was no 
more than the first and purest crea- 
ture of God. This denomination had 
the utmost aversion to the doctrine and 
discipline of the church of Rome. 

PASSALORYNCHITES, a branch 
of the Montanists. They held, that in 
order to be saved, it was necessary to 
observe a peipetual silence ; whei'efore 
they kept their finger constantly on 
then- mouth, and dared not open it, even 
to say theii' prayers. Their name is de- 
rived from the Greek rao-o-aXos, a nail, 
and s-iv, a ?20s/n7, because, when they put 
their finger to their mouth, they touch- 
ed their nose. 

Px\SSIVE OBEDIENCE OF

P ASSIVE PR AVER, among the m ys- 
tic divines, is a total suspensitjn or liga- 
ture of the intellectual laculties, in vir- 
tue whereof the soul remains of itself, 
and, as to its own power, impotent with 
regard to the producing of any effects. 
Tlie passive state, according to Fenelon, 
is only passive in the same sense as con- 
templation; i. e. it does not- exclude 
peaceable disinterested acts, but only 
unquiet ones, or such as tend to our own 
interest. In the passive state the soul 
has not properly any activity, any sen- 
sation of its own. It is a mere inflexi- 
bility of the soul, to which the feeblest 
impulse of grace gives motion. See 
Mystic. 

PASSION, in its general import, sig- 
nifies every feeling of the mind occa- 
sioned by an extrinsic cause. It is used 
to describe a violent commotion or agi- 
tation of the mind; emotion, zeal, ar- 
dour, or of ease wherein a man can con- 
quer his desires, or hold them in sub- 
jection. 1. As to the number of the 



PAS 



428 



PAS 



p-assions, Le Bi-un makes them about 
twenty, 1. Attention; 2. admiration; 
3. astonishment; 4. veneration; 5. 
rapture ; 6. joy, with tranquilhty ; 7. 
desire; 8. laughter; 9. acute pain; 
30. pains, simply bodily; 11. sadness; 
12. weeping; 13. compassion; 14. 
scorn; 15. hoiTor ; 16. terror or fright; 
17. anger; 18. hatred; 19. jealousy; 
20. despair. All these may be repre- 
sented on canvass by the pencil. Some 
make their number greater, adding 
aversion, love, emulation, &amp;c. &amp;c. these, 
however, may be considered as included 
in the above list. They are divided by 
some into public and private ; proper 
and improper ; social and selfish pas- 
sions. — 2. The orii^inal of the passions 
are from, impressions on the senses; 
from the operations of reason, by whicli 
good or evil are foreseen ; and form the 
recollections of memory. — 3. The objects 
&lt;jf .the passions are mostly things sen- 
sible, on account of their near alliance 
to the body : but objects of a spiritual 
nature also, though invisible, have a 
tendency to excite the passions ; such 
us the love of God, heaven, hell, eter- 
nity, 8cc. — 4. As to the innocency of the 
passions ; in themselves they are nei- 
ther good nor evil, but according to the 
p:ood or ill use that is made of them, and 
the degrees to which they rise. — 5. The 
usefulness of the passions is considerable, 
and were given us for a kind of spring 
or elasticity to correct the natural slug- 
gishness of the coiijoreal part. They 
gave birth to poetry, science, painting, 
music, and all the polite arts, which 
minister to pleasure ; nor are they less 
serviceable m the cause of religion and 
truth. — " They," says Dr. Watts, " when 
sanctified, set the powei-s of the under- 
standing at work in the search of 
di\ ine truth and leligious duty ; they 
keep the soul fixed to divine things ; 
render the duties of holiness much 
easier, and temptations to sin much 
weaker ; . and render us more like 
Christ, and fitter for his presence and 
enjo\aiient in heaven." — 6. As to the 
regulation of the passions : to know 
whether they are under due restraints, 
^and directed to proper objects, we must 
inquire whether they influence our 
opinions ; nm before the understanding ; 
engaged in trifling, and neglectful of 
iaiportaiit objects; express themselves 
in an indecent manner ; and whether 
they disorder our conduct. If this be 
iVie case, they are out of their due 
bounds, and will become sources of 
trial rather than instruments of goocL 
To have them properly re:^ul ited we 
:should possess knowledge ot our duty, 



take God's word for our rule, be much 
in prayer and dependence on the Divine 
Being. — 7. Lastly, we should study the 
passions. To examine them accurately, 
uideed, requires much skill, • patience, 
observation, and judgment ; but to form 
any proper idea of the human mind, and 
its various operations ; to detect the er- 
rors that arise from heated tempera- 
ment and intellectual excess ; to know 
how to touch their various strings, and 
to direct and employ them in the best 
of all services ; I say, to accomplish 
these ends, the study of the passions is 
of the greatest consequence. 

" Amidst the numerous branches of 
knowledge,*" says Mr. Cogan, "which 
claim the attention of the human mind, 
no one can be more important than this. 
Whatever most intimately concerns our- 
selves must be of the first moment. An 
attention, therefore, to the workings of 
our own minds ; tracing the power 
which external objects have over us; 
discovering the nature of our emotions 
and affections ; and comprehending the 
reason of our being affected in a par- 
ticular manner, must have a direct in- 
fluence upon our pursuits, our cha- 
racters, and our happiness. It may 
with justice be advanced, that the hap- 
piness of ourselves in this department is 
of much greater utility than abstruser 
speculations concerning the nature of 
the human soul, or even the most accu- 
rate knowledge of its intellectual powers ; 
for it is according as the passions and af- 
fections are excited and directed to- 
wards the objects investigated by our in- 
tellectual natures that we become use- 
ful to ourselves or others : that we rise 
into respectability, or sink into con- 
tempt ; that we diffuse or enjoy happi- 
ness, diffuse or suffer misery. An accu-, 
rate analysis of these passions and af- 
fections, therefore, is to the moralist 
what the science of anatomy is to the 
surgeon. It constitutes the first prin- 
ciples of rational practice ; it is, in a 
moral view, the anatomy of the heart ; 
it discovers w/iy it beats, and how it 
beats ; indicates appearances in a sound 
and healthy state ; detects diseases with 
their causes, and it is infinitely more 
fortunate in the power it communicates 
of applying suitable remedies."

their coming out of Egypt; because, 
the night before their departure, the 
destroying angel, who put to death the 
first-bom of the Egyptians, passed over 
the houses of the Hebrews, without en- 
tering therein ; because they were

which was killed the evening before, 
and which for fhis reason was called the

PASTOR, literally a shepherd ; 
figuratively a stated minister appointed 
to watch over and instinict a congi'ega- 
tion. Of the qualifications of ministers 
we have ah'eady made some remarks 
under that article; but the following, 
taken from the works of a spiritual and 
useful writer, we hope, will not be found 
superfluous. Jesus Christ's description 
of an evangelical pastor, Matt. xxiv. 45, 
includes two things, faithfulness and 
prudence. " If a minister be faithful, he 
deceives not others ; and if he be pru- 
dent, he is not apt to be deceived him- 
self. His prudence suffers not deceivers 
easily to impose upon him ; and his 
faithfulness wUl not suffer him know- 
ingly to impose upon his people. His 
prudence will enable him to discern, 
and his faithfulness oblige him to dis- 
tribute wholesome food to his flock. 
But more particularly, 

1. " Ministerial faithfulness includes 
pure and spiritual aims and intentions 
for God, Phil. ii. 20, 21.— -2. Personal 
sincerity, or integrity of heart, Neh. ix. 
8. 1 Cor. ii. 12. — 3. Dihgence in the 
discharge of duty. Matt. xxv. 21. 1 
Tim. iv. 2. — 4. Impartiality in the ad- 
ministrations of Christ's house, 1 Tim. 
V. 21. — 5. An unshaken constancy and 

Sersevei'ance to the end. Rev. ii. 10. 
ut the Lord's servants must not only 
be faithful, hut prudent, discreet, and 
wise. Fidelity and honesty make a 
good Christian ; but the addition of pru- 
dence to fidelity makes a good steward. 
Faithfulness will fix the eye upon the 
right end; but it is pnidence must di- 
rect to the proper means of attaining it. 
The use of prudence to a minister is 
unspeakably great : it not only gives 
clearness and perspicacity to the mind, 
by freeing it from passions and corporeal 
impressions, enabling it thereby to ap- 
prehend what is best to be done, but 
enables it in its deliberations about the 
means to make choice of the most apt 
and Droper ; and directs the application 
of tViem in the fittest season, without 

Erecipitation by too much haste, or 
azard by too tedious delay. 
•-&gt;-_ "Prudence will direct us to lav a 



good foundation of knowledge in our 
people's souls by catechising and in- 
sti-ucting them in the principles of 
Christianity, without which we labour 
in vain. — 2. Ministerial pnidence dis- 
covers itself in the choice of such sub- 
jects as the needs of our people's souls 
do most require and call for. — 3. It will 
not only direct us in the choice of our 
subjects, but of the language, too, in 
which we dress and deliver them to our 
people. — 4. It wQl show us of what 
great use our own affections are for the 
moving of others; and will therefore 
advise us, that, if ever we expect the 
truths we preach should operate upon 
the heai'ts of others, we must first have 
them impressed on our own hearts, 
Phil. iii. 18. — 5. It will direct us to be 
careful, by the strictness and gravity of 
our deportment, to maintain our esteem 
in the consciences of our people.^-6. It 
will excite us to seek a blessing from 
God upon our studies and labours, as 
knowing all our ministerial success en- 
tirely depends thereupon." 1 Cor. iii.

gelical Pastor, in the second Volumi of 
his Works, p. 763, fol. ed. and books

PATIENCE, that calm and unruflHed 
temper with which a good man bears 
the evils of life. " Patience," says an 
eminent writer, "is apt to be ranked 
by many among the more humble and 
obscure virtues, belonging chiefly to 
those who groan on a sick bed, or who 
languish in a prison ; but in every cir- 
cumstance of life no virtue is more im- 
fiortant both to duty and to happiness, 
t is not confined to a situation of con- 
tinued adversity : it prmcipally, indeed, 
regards the disagreeable cuxumstances 
which are apt to occur ; but prosperity 
cannot be enjoyed, any more than ad- 
versity supported without it. It must 
enter into the temper, and form the ha- 
bit of the soul, if we would pass through 
the world with tranquillity and honour." 
"Christian patience," says Mason, "is 
essentially different from insensibility, 
whether natural, artificial, or acquired. 
This, indeed, sometimes passes tor pa- 
tience, though it be in reality quite 
another thing; for patience signifies 
suffering. Now if you inflict ever so 
much pain on the body of another, if he 
is not sensible of it, it is no pain to him ; 
he suffers nothing ; consequently calm- 
ness under it is no patience. This in- 
sensibility is sometimes natural. Some, 
in the native temperament of their mind 
and body are much less susceptible of 
pain than others are. — There are differ- 
ent degrees of insensibilitj- in men, both

ill their animal and mental frame ; so 
that the same event may be a great ex- 
ercise of patiei\ce to one man, which is 
none at all to another, as the latter feels 
little or no pain from that wound in- 
flicted on the body or mind which gives 
the most exquisite anguish to the for- 
mer. Again ; there is an artificial in- 
sensibility : such as is procured by opi- 
ates, which blunt the edge of pain ; and 
there is an acquh-ed insensibility; or 
that which is attained by the force of 
principles strongly inculcated, 'or by 
long custom. Such was the apathy of 
the Stoic% who obstinately maintamed 
that pain was no evil, and therefore 
bore It with amazing firmness, which, 
however, was very diiferent from the 
virtue of Christian patience, as appears 
from the principles from which they 
respectively proceeded ; the one spring- 
ing from ])ride, the other from humi- 
lity." Christian patience, then, is some- 
thing different from all these. '' It is 
not a careless indolence, a stupid insen- 
sibilit}-, mechanical bravery, constitu- 
tional fortitude, a daring stoutness of 
spirit, resulting from fatalism, philoso- 
phy, or pride : — it is derived from a di- 
Aine agency, nourished by heavenly 
truth, and giiided by Scriptural rules." 

" Patience," says Mr. Jay, " must be 
dis])layed under provocations. Our 
opinioiis, reputation, connexions, offices, 
business, render us widely vulneraljle. 
The characters of men are various: 
their pursuits and their interests per- 
petually clash: some try us by their 
Ignorance; some by their folly; some 
Ijy their perverseness ; some by their 
malice. Here, then, is an opportunity 
for the triumph of patience. — We are 
very susceptive of irritation ; anger is 
eloquent; revenge is sweet: but to stand 
calm and collected ; to suspend the 
blow which passion was urgent to strike ; 
to drive the reasons of clemency as far 
as they will go ; to bring forward fairly 
in view the ciixumstances of mitigation : 
to distinguish between suiprise and de- 
liberation, infirmity and crime ; or if 
infliction be deemed necessary, to leave 
God to be both the judge and the exe- 
cutioner ; this a Christian should labour 
after: his peace recjuires it. People 
love to sing the passionate ; they who 
are easily proA'oked, commit their re- 
pose to the keeping of their enemies ; 
tliey lie down at their feet, and incite 
them to strike. The man of temper 
places himself beyond vexatious inter- 
i-uption. ' He that hath no rule over his 
own spirit, is like a city that is broken 
down, and without walls,' into which 
enter over the ruins serpents, vagrants, 



thieves, enemies; while the man who 
in patience possesses his soul, has the 
command of himself, places a defence 
all around him, and forbids the en- 
trance of such unwelcome company to 
offend or discompose. His ivisaom re- 
quires it. ' He that is slow to anger is 
of great understanding ;^ but he that is 
hasty of spirit, exalteth folly.' Wisdom 
gi\ es us large, various, comprehensive 
views of thhigs ; the very exercise ope- 
rates as a diversion, affords the mmd 
time to cool, and furnishes numberless 
circumstances tending to soften severity. 
His dignitij requires it. ' It is the glory 
of a man to pass by a transgression.' 
The man provoked to revenge is con- 
quered, and loses the glory of the strug- 
gle ; while he who forbears comes off 
victor, crowned with no common lau- 
rels. A flood assails a rock, and rolls 
off unable to make an impression ; while 
straws and boughs are borne oft" in tri- 
umph, carried down the stream, driven 
and tossed.^ Examples require it. What 
provocations had Joseph received from 
Iiis brethren ? but he scarcely mentions 
the crime : so eager is he to announce 
the pardon. David says, ' They re- 
warded me evil for good ; but as for me, 
when they were sick, my clothing was 
sackcloth. Stephen, dying vmder a 
shower of stones, prays for his enemies : 
' Lord, lav not this sin to their charge.' 
But a greater than Joseph, or David, or 
Stephen, is here. Go to the foot of the 
cross, and behold Jesus, buffering for us. 
Every thing conspired to i-ender the 
provocation hehious ; the nature of the 
offence, the meanness and obligation of 
the offenders, the righteousness of his 
cause, the grandeur of his person ; and 
all these seemed to call for vengeance. 
The creatures were eager to punish. 
Peter drew his sword ; the sun resolved 
to shine on such criminals no longer; 
the rocks asked to crush them ; the 
earth trembles under the sinful load; 
the very dead cannot remain in their 
graves. He suffers them all to testify 
their sympathy, but forbids their re- 
venge ; and, lest the Judge of all should 
pour forth his fury, he cries, ' Father, 
forgi\e them, for they know not what 
they do !' — 2. Patience is to be displayed 
in s'uffering affliction. This is another 
field in which patience gathers glory. 
Affliction comes to exercise our patience, 
and to distinguish it. ' The ti'ial of your 
faith worketh patience,' not only in 
consequence of the divine blessing, but 
by the natural operation of things ; use 
makes perfect; the yoke is rendered 
easy by being worn, and those parts of 
the' body \\ hich are most in action are 



PAT

PAT 



the most strong and solid ; and, there- 
fore, we are not to excuse improper dis- 
positions under affliction, by saying, * It 
was so trying, Avho could help it ?' This 
is to justify impatience by what God 
sends on purpose to make you patient. 
— 3. Patience is to be exercised under 
delays. We as naturally pursue a de- 
sired good as Ave shun an apprehended 
evil : the want of such a good is as griev- 
ous as the pressure of such an evil ; and 
an ability to bear the one is as needful a 
qualification as the fortitude by which 
we endure the other. It therefore, 
equally belongs to patience to wait, as to 
suffer. God does not always imme- 
diately indulge us with an answer to our 
prayers. He hears, indeed, as soon as 
we knock; but he does not open the 
door : to staiid there resolved not to go 
without a blessing, requires patience; 
and patience cries, ' Wait on the Lord ; 
be of good courage, and he shall 
strengthen thine heart : wait, I say, on 
the Lord.' 

We have, however, the most power- 
ful motives to excite us to the attain- 
ment of this grace. 1. God is a God of 
patience, Rom. xv. 5. — 2. It is enjoined 
by the Gospel, Rom. xii. 12. Luke xxi. 
19. — 3. The present state of man ren- 
ders the practice of it absolutely ne- 
cessary, Heb. X. 36. — 4. The manifold 
inconvenience of impatience is a strong 
motive, John iv. Psul. cvi. — 5. Eminent 
examples of it, Heb. xii. 2. Heb. vi. 12. 
Job i. 22. — 6. Reflect that all our trials 
will terminate in triumph, James v. 7,

PATIENCE OF GOD is his long 
suffering or forbearance. He is called 
the God of patience, not only because 
he is the author and object of the grace 
of patience, but because he is patient or 
long suffering in himself, and towards 
his creatures. It is not, indeed, to be 
considered as a quality, accident, pas- 
sion, or affection in God as in creatures, 
but belongs to the very nature and es- 
sence of God, and springs from his 
goodness and mercy,, Rom. ii. 4. It is 
said to be exercised towards his chosen 
people, 2 Pet. iir. 9. Rom. iii. 25. Isa. 
XXX. 18. 1 Tim. i. 16. and towai-ds the 
ungodly, Rom. ii. 4. Eccl. viii. 11. The 
end of his forbearance to the wicked, is, 
that they may be without excuse ; to 
make his power and goodness visible ; 
and partly for the sake of his own peo- 



ple, Gen. xviii. 32. Rev. vi. II. 2 Pet, 
iii. 9. His patience is manifested by 
giving wanmigs of judgments before he 
executes them, Hos. vi. 5. Amos i. 1. 
2 Pet. ii. 5. In long delaying his judg- 
ments, Eccl. viii. 11. In often mixing 
mercy with them. There ai'e many in- 
stances of his patience recorded in the 
Scriptures; with the old world, Gen. 
vi. 3 ; the inhabitants of Sodom, Gen. 
xviii ; in Pharaoh, Exod. v ; in the peo- 
ple of Israel in the wilderness, Acts 
xiii. 18 ; in the Amorites and Canaan- 
ites. Gen. xv. 15. Lev. xviii. 28 . in the 
Gentile world. Acts x\'ii. 30 ; in fruit- 
less professors, Luke xiii. 6,- 9 ; in An-

PATRIARCHS, heads of families; 
a name applied chiefly to those who 
lived before Moses, who Avere both 
priests and pi-inces, Avithout peculiar 
places fitted for Avorship, Acts ii. 29. 
vii. 8, 9. Heb. vii. 4. 

Patriarchs among Christians, are ec- 
clesiastical dignitaries, or bishops, so 
called from their pateraal authority in 
the church. The poAver of patriarchs 
was not the same in all, but differed ac- 
cording to the different custom.s of 
countries, or the pleasures of kings and 
councils. Thus the patriai'ch ot Con- 
stantinople greAV to be a patriarch over 
the patriarchs of Ephesus and Cxsarea, 
and Avas called the CEcumenical and 
Universal Patriarch; and the patri- 
arch of Alexandria had some preroga- 
tives Avhich no other patriarch but him- 
self enjoyed ; such as the right of con- 
secrating and approving of eveiy single 
Inshop under his jurisdiction. The pa- I 
triarchate has ever been esteemed the I 
supreme dignity in the church : the bi-l 
shop had only under him the territory' 
of the city of which he was bisliop ; the 
metropolitan siujerintended a province,! 
and had for suffragans the bishops of hi.s 
provhice ; the primate Avas the chief of 
what Avas then called a diocess, and had 
several metropolitans under him ; and 
the patriarch had under him several 
diocesses, composing one exarchate, and 
the primates themselves Avere under 
him. Usher, Pagi, De Marca, and Mo- 
rinus, attribute the establishment of tlie 
grand patriarchates to the _ apostles 
themselves, who, in their opinion, ac- 
cording to the description of the Avorjd 
then given by geographers, pitched 
on three principal cities in the thrie 
parts of the known world, viz. Rome in 
Europe, Antioch in Asia, and Alexap.-

diia in Africa: and thus foniied a tri- 
nity of patriarchs. Others maintain, 
that the name patriarcli was unknown 
at the time of the council of Nice ; and 
that for a long time afterwards patri- 
archs and jjrimates were confounded to- 
gether, as being till equally chiefs of 
diocesses, and equally superior to me- 
tropolitans, who were only chiefs of 
pi-ovinces. Hence Socrates gives the 
title patriarch to all the chiefs of dio- 
cesses, and reckons ten of them. Indeed, 
it does not appear that the dignity of 
patriarch was appropriated to the five 
grand sees of Rome, Constantinople, 
Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, 
till after the council of Chalcedon, in 
45 1 ; for when the council of Nice regu- 
lated the limits and prerogatives of the 
three patriarchs of Rome, Antioch, and 
Alexandria, it did not give them the ti- 
tle of patriarchs, though it allowed 
them the pre-eminence and privileges 
thereof: thus when the council of Con- 
stantinople adjudged the second place to 
the bishop of Constantinople, who, till 
then, was only a suffragan of Heraclea, 
it said nothing of the patriarchate. Nor 
is the term patriarch found in the de- 
cree of the council of Chalcedon, where- 
by the fifth place is assigned to the bi- 
shop of Jeioisalem ; nor did these five 
patriarchs govern all the churches. 

There were besides many independent 
chiefs of diocesses, who, .far from own- 
ing the jurisdiction of the grand patri- 
archs, called themselves patriarchs, 
such as that of Aquileia ; nor was Car- 
thage ever subject to the patriarch of 
Alexandria. Mosheim {^Eccles. Hist. 
vol. i. p. 284.) imagines that the bishops 
Avho enjoyed a certain degree of pre- 
eminence over the rest of their order, 
were distinguished by the Jewish title 
of patriarchs in the fourth century. 
The authority of the patriarchs gra- 
dually increased till about the close of 
the fifth century : all affairs of. moment 
within the compass of their patriarch- 
ates came before them, either at first 
hand, or by appeals from the metropo- 
litans. They consecrated bishops ; as- 
sembled yearly in council the clergy of 
their respective districts; pronounced 
a decisive judgment in those cases where 
accusations were brought against bi- 
shops ; and appointed vicars or de- 
puties, clothed with their authority, for 
the preservation of order and tranquil- 
lity in the remoter provinces. In short, 
nothing was done without consulting 
them, and their decrees were executed 
with the same regularity and respect as 
those of the princes. 

3t deserves to be remarked, however, 



that the authority of the patriarchs was 
not acknowledged through all the pro- 
^'inces without exception. Several dis- 
tricts, both in the eastern and western 
empires, Avei-e exempted from their ju- 
risdiction. The Latin church had ho 
patriarchs till the sixth century; and 
the churches of Gaul, Britain, &amp;c. were 
never subject to the authority of the 
patriarch of Rome, whose authority 
only extended to the suburbicary pro-: 
vinces. There was no primacy, no ex- 
archate, nor patriarchate, owned here ; 
but the bishops, Avith the metropolitans, 
governed the church in comrnon. In- 
deed, after the name patriarch became 
frequent in the West, it was attributed 
to the bishop of Bourges and Lyons ; but 
it was only in the first signification, viz. 
as heads of diocesses. Du Cange says, 
that there have been some abbots who 
have borne the title of patriarchs. 

PATRICIANS, ancient sectaries who 
disturbed the peace of the church in the 
beginning of the third century ; thus 
called from their founder Patricius, 
preceptor of a Marchionite called Sym- 
machus. His distinguishing tenet was, 
that the substance of the flesh is not the 
work of God, but that of the devil ; on 
which account his adherents bore an 
imjilacable hatred to their own flesh, 
which sometimes carried them so far 
as to kill themselves. 

PATRIPASSIANS, a sect that ap- 
peared about the latter end of the second 
century ; so called from their ascribing 
the passion or sufferings of Christ to the 
Father ; for they asserted the unity of 
God in such a manner as to destroy all 
distinctions of persons, and to make the 
Father and Son precisely the same ; in 
which they were followed by the Sa- 
bellians and others. The author and 
head of the Patrimssians was Praxeas, 
a philosopher of Pnrygia, in Asia. 

PATRONAGE, or ApvowsoN, a 
soi't of incorporeal hereditament, con- 
sisting in the right of presentation to a 
church, or ecclesiastical benefice. Ad- 
vowson signifies the taking into pro- 
tection, and therefore is synonymous with 
patronage ; and he who has the right of 
advowson is called the patron of the 
church. 

PAULIANISTS, a sect so called 
from their founder, Paulus Samosatenus, 
a native of Samo^ata, elected bishop of 
Antioch, in 262. His doctrine seems to 
have amounted to this: that the Son 
and the Holy Ghost exist in God in the 
same manner as the faculties of reason 
and activity do in man ; that Christ wa^ 
bom a mere man ; but that the reason 
or wisdom of the Father descended jntn

liim, and by him wrought miracles upon 
earth, and instructed the nations, and, 
finally, that on account of this union of 
the divine Word with the man Jesus, 
Christ might, though improperly, be 
called God. It is also said that he did 
not baptise in the name of the Father 
and the Son, &amp;c. for which reason the 
council of Nice ordered those baptised 
by him to be re-baptised. Being qon- 
demned by Dionysius Alexandrinus in a 
council, he abjured his errors to avoid 
deposition; but soon after he resumed 
them, and was actuaUv deposed by ano- 
ther council in 269. He may be consi- 
dered as the father of the modem Soci- 
nians ; and his errors are severely con- 
demned by the council of Nice, whose 
creed differs a little fi-om that now used 
under the same name in the church of 
England. The creed agreed upon bj' 
the Nicene fathers with a view to the 
errors of Paulus Sumosatenus concludes 
thus : " But those who say there was a 
time when he was not, and that he was 
not before he was born, the catholic and 
apostolic church anathematize." 

PAULICIANS, a branch of the an- 
cient Manichees; so called from their 
founder, one Paulus, an Armenian, in 
the seventh century, who, with his bro- 
ther John, both of Samosata, formed 
this sect; though others are of opinion 
that they %ere thus called from another 
Paul, an AiTnenian by birth, who lived 
under the reign of Justinian II. In the 
seventh century, a zealot, called Con- 
stantine, revived this drooping sect, 
which had suffered much from the vio- 
lence of its adversaries, and was ready 
to expire under the severity of the im- 
perial edicts, and that zeal with which 
they were carried into execution. The 
Paulicians, however, by their number, 
and the countenance of the emperor 
Nicephorus, became formidable to all 
the East. But the cruel rage of perse- 
cution, which had for some years been 
suspended, broke forth with redoubled 
violence under the reigns of Michael 
Curopalates, and Leo the Armenian, 
who mflicted capital punishment on such 
of the Paulicians as refused to return 
into the bosom of the church. The em- 
press Theodora, tutoress of the empe- 
ror Michael, in 845, would oblige them 
either to be converted, or to quit the 
empire ; upon which sevei-al of them 
were put to death, and more retired 
among the Saracens; but they were 
neither aU exterminated nor banished. 

Upon this they entered into a league 
•with the Saracens, and, choosing for 
their chief an officer of the greatest re- 
solution and valour, whose name was 



Carbeus, they declared against the 
Greeks a war, which was earned on 
for fifty years with the gi-eatest vehe- 
mence and fury. During these commo- 
tions, some Paulicians, towards the con- 
clusion of this century, spread abroad 
their doctrines among the Bulgarians; 
many of them, either from a principle 
of zeal for the propagation of tneir opi- 
nions, or from a natural desire of flvuig 
from the persecution which they suffer- 
ed under the Grecian yoke, retired 
about the close of the eleventh century 
from Bulgaria and Thrace, and formed 
settlements in other countries. Their 
first migration was into Italy; whence, 
in process of time, they sent colonies 
into almost all the other provinces of 
Europe, and formed gradually a consi- 
derable number of religious assemblies, 
who adhered to their doctrine, and who 
were afterwards persecuted with the ut- 
most vehemence by the Roman pontiffs. 
In Italy they were "called Fatarini, from 
a certain place called Pat aria, being a 
part of the city of Milan where they 
held their assemblies : and Gathari, or 
Gazari, from Gazaria, or the Lesser 
Tartary. In France they were called 
Albi^enseis, though their faith differed 
widely from that of Albigenses, whom 
Protestant writers generally vindicate 
(See Albigenses.) The first religious 
assembly the Paulicians had formed in 
Europe, is said to have been discovered 
at Orleans in 1017, under the i-eign of 
Robert, when many of them were con- 
demned to be burnt alive. The ancient 
Paulicians, according to Photius, ex- 
pressed the utmost abhorrence of Manes 
and his doctrine. The Greek writers 
comprise their errors under the six fol- 
lowing particulars : 1. They denied that 
this inferior and visible woi-ld is the pro- 
duction of the Supreme Being ; and they" 
distinguish the Creator of the world 
and of human bodies from the Most 
High God who dwells in the heavens; 
and hence some have been led to con- 
ceive that they were a branch of the 
Gnostics rather than of the Manicheans. 
-—2. They treated contemptuously the 
Virgin Mar}-, or, according to the usual 
manner of speaking among the Greeks 
thev refused to adore and worship her. — 
3. They refused to celebrate the institu- 
tion of the Lord's supper. — 4. They 
loaded the cross of Christ with con- 
tempt and reproach, by which we are 
only to understand that they refused to 
follow the absurd and superstitious prac- 
tice of the Greeks, who paid to the pre* 
tended wood of the cross a certain sort 
of religious homage. — 5. They rejected, 
after the example of the gi-eatest part

of the Gnostics, the books of the Old 
Testament; and looked upon the winters 
of tliat sacred history as inspired by the 
Creator of this world, and not by the 
Supreme God. — 6. They excluded pres- 
byters and elders from all part in the 
administration of the church. 

PEACE, that state of mind in which 
persons are exposed to no open violence 
to interi'upt their tranquillity. 1. Social 
fieace is mutual agreement one with

PELAGIANS, a sect who appeared 
about the end of the fourth century. 
They maintained the following doc- 
trines : 1. That Adam was by nature 
mortal, and, whether he had sinned or 
not, would certainly ha-ve died. — 2. That 
the consequences of Adam's sin were 
confined to his own person. — 3. That 
new-bom infants are in tlie same situa- 
tion with Adaip before the fall. — 4. That 
the law quali^ed men for the kingdom 
of heaven, and was founded upon equal 
promises with the Gospel. — 5. That the 
general resurrection of the dead does 
not follow in virtue of our Saviour's re- 
surrection. — 6. That the grace of God 
is given according to our mei-its. — 7. 
That this grace is not granted for the 

fierformance of every moral act; the 
iberty of the will and information in 
points of duty being sufficient. 

The founder of this sect was Pelagius, 
a native of Great Britain. He was edu- 
cated in the monastery of Banchor, in 
Wales, of which he became a monk, 
and afterwards an abbot. In the early 
part of his life he went over to France, 
and thence to Rome, where he and his 
friend Celestius propagated their opi- 
nions, though in a private manner. 
Upon the approach of the Goths, A. D. 
410, they retn-ed from Rome, and went 
first into Sicily, and afterwards into 
Africa, where they published their doc- 
trines with more fi-eedom. From Africa, 
Pelagius passed into Palestine, while 
Ceiestius remained at Carthage, with a 



view to preferment, desiring to be ad- 
mitted among the presbyters of that 
city. But the discovery of his opinions 
having blasted all his hopes, and his er- 
rors being condemned in a council held 
at Carthage, A. D. 412, he departed 
from that city, and went into the East. 
It was from this time, that Augustin, the 
famous bishop of Hippo, began to attack 
the tenets of Pelagms and Celestius in 
his learned and elegant writings; and 
to him, indeed, is principally due the 
glory of having suppressed this sect in 
its very birth. 

Things went more smoothly with Pe- 
lagius in the East, where he enjoyed 
the protection and favour of John, bi- 
shop of Jerusalem, whose attachment to 
the sentiments of Origen led him natu- 
rally to countenance those of Pelagius, 
on account of the conformity that there 
seemed to be between these two sys- 
tems. Under the shadow of this pow- 
erful protection, Pelagius made a pub- 
lic profession of his opinions, and form- 
ed disciples in several places. And 
though, m the year 415, he was accused 
by Orosius, a Spanish presbyter, whom 
Augustin had sent into Palestine for 
that purpose, before an assembly of bi- 
shops met at Jerusalem, yet he was dis- 
missed without the least censure ; and 
not only so, but was soon after fully ac- 

iuitted of all erroi-s by the* cbuncil of 
)iospolis. 

This controversy was brought to 
Rome, and referred by Celestius and 
Pelagius to the decision of Zosimus, who 
was raised to the pontificate, A. D. 417. 
The new pontiff, gained over by the am- 
biguous and seemingly orthodox con- 
fession of faith that Celestius, who was 
now at Rome, had artfully drawn up, 
and also by the letters and protestations 
of Pelagius, pronounced b favour of 
these monks, declared them sound in 
the faith, and unjustly persecuted by 
their adversaries. The African bishops, 
with Augustin at their head, little af- 
fected with this declaration, continued 
obstinately to maintain the judgment 
they had pronounced in this matter, and 
to strengthen it by their exhortations, 
their letters and their writings. Zosimus 
yielded to the perseverance of the Afri- 
cans, changed nis mind, and condemn- 
ed, with the utmost severity, Pelagius 
and Celestius, whom he had honoured 
with his approbation, and covered with 
his protection. This was followed by a 
train of evils, which pursued these two 
monks without interruption. They were 
condemned, says Mosneim, by that same 
Ephesian council which had launched 
its thunder at the head of Nestorius. In

short, the Gauls, Britons, and Afiicans, 
Dy their councils, and emperors, by their 
edicts and penal laws, demolished tliis 
sect in its infancy, and suppressed it en- 
tirely before it had acquired any tolera- 
ble degree of vigour or consistence. 

PENANCE, a punishment either vo- 
luntary, or imposed by authority, for 
the faults a person has committed. Pe- 
nance is one of the seven sacraments of 
the Romish Church. Besides fasting, 
alms, abstinence, and the like, which 
are the general conditions of penance, 
there are others of a more particular 
kind; as the repeating a certain num- 
ber of avemarys, paternosters, and cre- 
dos; wearing a hair shift, and giving 
oneself a certain number of stripes. In 
Italy and Spain it is usual to see Chris- 
tians, almost naked, loaded with chains, 
and lashing themselves at every step. 
See Popery. 

PENITENCE is sometimes used for 
a state of repentance, and sometimes for 
the act of repenting. It is also used for 
a discipline or punishment attending re- 

Ijentance, more usually called penance. 
X also gives title to se\'eral religious or- 
ders, consisting either of converted de- 
bauchees and reformed prostitutes, or of 
persons who devote themselves to the 
office of reclaiming them. See next ar- 
ticle. 

Order of fienitents of St. Magdalen 
was established about the year 1272, by 
one Barnard, a citi^.en of Marseilles, 
who devoted hnnself to the work of 
converting the courtesans of that city. 
Barnard was seconded by several others, 
who, forming a kind of society, were at 
length erected into a religious order by 
pope Nicholas III. under the rule of St. 
Augustin. F. Gesney says, they also 
made a religious order of the penitents, 
or women they converted, givmg them 
the same rules and observances which 
they themselves kept. 

Congregation of penitents of St. Mag- 
dalen at Paris, owed its i-ise to the 
preaching of F. Tisseran, a Franciscan, 
who converted a vast number of courte- 
sans, about the year 1492. Louis, duke of 
Orleans, gave tliem his house for a mo- 
nastery ; or rather, as appears by their 
constitution, Charles VlII. gave them 
the hotel called Bochaigne, whence they 
were removed to St. George's Chapel, 
in 1572. By virtue of a brief of pope 
Alexander, Simon, bishop of Pans, ui 
1497, drew them up a body of statutes, 
and gave them the rule of St. Augustin. 
It was necessary before a woman could 
be admitted, that she had first com- 
mitted the sin of the flesh. None were 
admitted who were above thirty-five 



years of age. Since its reformation by 
Mary Alvequin, in 1616, none have 
been admitted but nmids, who, however, 
still retain the ancient name, penitents. 
PENITENTS, an appellation given 
to certain fraternities of penitents, dis- 
tinguished by the different shape and 
colour of their habits. These are secu- 
lar societies, who have their rules, sta- 
tutes, and churches, and make public 
processions under their particular cross- 
es or banners. Of these, it is said, there 
are more than a hundred, the most con- 
siderable of which are as follow: the 
White Penitents, of which thei'e are se- 
veral different sorts at Rome, the most 
ancient of which was constituted in 
1264: the brethren of this fraternity 
every year give portions to a certain 
number of young girls, in order to their 
being married : their habit is a kind of 
white sackcloth, and on the shoulder is 
a circle, in the middle of which is a red 
and white cross. Black Penitents, the 
most considerable of which are the Bre- 
thren of Mercy, instituted in 1488 by 
some Florentines, in order to assist cri- 
minals during their imprisonment, and 
at the time of their death. On the day 
of execution they walk in procession be- 
fore them, singing the seven penitential 
psalms, and the litanies ; and after they 
are dead, they take them down from the 
gibbet, and bury them: their habit is 
black sackcloth. There aie others 
whose business is to bui-y such per- 
sons as are found dead in the streets: 
these wear a death's head on one side of 
their habit. There are also blue, gray, 
red, green, and violet penitents, all which 
are reniai-kable for little else besides the 
different colours of their habits. 

Penitents, or Converts of the name of 
Jesus, a congregation of i-eligious at Se- 
ville, in Spain, consisting of women who 
have led a licentious life, founded in 
1550. This monastery is divided into 
three quarters: one for professed reli- 
gious; another for novices; a thii'd for 
those who are under correction. When 
these last give signs of a real repen- 
tance, they are removed into the quar- 
ter of the novices, where, if they do not 
behave themselves well, they are re- 
manded to their correction. They ob- 
serve the i-ule of St. Augustin. 

Penitents of Orvieto, are an order of 
nuns instituted by Antony Simoncelli, a 
gentleman of Orvieto, in Italy. The 
monastery he built was at first' design- 
ed for the reception of poor girls aban- 
doned by their parents, and. in danger 
of losing their virtue. In 1662 it was 
ei'ected into a monastery, for the recep- 
tion of such as having abandoned them •

selves to impurity, were willing to take 
wp, and consecrate themselves to God 
by solemn vows. Their rule is that of 
the Carmelites. 

PENITENTIAL, an ecclesiastical 
book, retained among the Romanists, in 
which is prescribed what relates to the 
imposition of penance, and the recon- 
ciliation of penitents. There are vari- 
ous penitentials, as the Roman peniten- 
tial ; that of the venei'able Bede ; that 
of pope Gregorv the Third, &amp;c. 

PENITENTIARY, in the ancient 
Christian church, a name given to cer- 
tain presbyters or priests, appointed in 
every church to receive the private 
confessions of the people, in order to 
facilitate public discipline, by acquaint- 
ing them what sins were to be expiated 
by public penance, and to appoint pri- 
vate penance for such private crimes as 
were not proper to be publicly cen- 
sured. 

Penitentiary, also, in the court of 
Rome, is an office in which are ex- 
amined and delivered out the secret 
bulls, dispensations, 8cc. Penitentiary 
is also an officer in some cathedrals, 
vested with power from the bishop to 
absolve in cases referred to him. 

PENTATEUCH, from ne^h, five, 
and TEuxos, an instrument or volume, 
signifies the collection of the five instru- 
ments or books of Moses, which are 
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, 
and Deuteronomy. Some modem wri- 
ters, it seems, ha^ e asserted that Moses 
did not compose the Pentateuch, be- 
cause the author always speaks in the 
third person; abridges his narration 
like a writer who collected from an- 
cient memoirs ; sometimes interrupts 
the thread of his discourse, for exam- 
ple. Gen. iv. 23 ; and because of the ac- 
count of the death of Moses at the end, 
&amp;c. It is observed, also, in the text of 
the Pentateuch, that there are some 
places that are defective ; for example, 
m Exod. xii. 8. we see Moses speaking 
. to Pharaoh, where the author omits the 
begmning of his discourse. The Sama- 
ritan inserts in the same place what is 
wanting in the Hebrew. In other places 
the same Samaritan copy adds what is 
deficient in the Hebi'ew ; and what is 
contained more than the Hebrew seems 
so well connected with the rest of the 
discourse, that it would be difficult to 
separate them. Lastly, they think they 
observe certain strokes in the Penta- 
teuch which can hardly agree with 
Moses, who was bom and bred in Eg&gt;'pt ; 
as what he says of the earthly paradise, 
of the ri\ers that watered it and ran 
through it; of the cities of Babylon, 



Erec.h, Resen, and Calneh ; of the gold 
of Pison ; of the bdellium, of the stone 
of Sohem, or onyx stone, which was to 
be found in that country. — These parti- 
culars, observed with such cunosity, 
seem to prove th^t the author of the 
Peritateuch lived beyond the Euphrates. 
Add what he says concerning the ark of 
Noah, of its construction, of the place 
where it rested, of the wood wherewith 
it was built, of the bitumen of Babylon, 
&amp;c. But in answer to all these objections 
it is justly observed, that these books are 
by the most ancient writers ascribed to 
Moses, and it is confirmed by the au- 
thority of heathen writers themselves, 
that they are his writings ; besides this, 
we have the unanimous testimony of the 
whole Jewish nation ever since Moses's 
time. Divers texts of the Pentateuch 
imply that it was written by him ; and 
the book of Joshua and other parts of 
Scripture import as much ; and though 
some passages have been thought to 
imply the contrary, yet this is but a late 
opinion, and has been sufficiently con- 
futed by several learned men. It is pro- 
bable, however, that Ezra published a 
new edition of the books of Moses, in 
which he might add those passages that 
many sup^se Moses did not write. 
The Abbe Torne, in a sermon preached 
before the French king in Lent, 1764, 
makes the following remarks: "The 
legislator of the Jews was the author of 
the Pentateuch; an immortal work, 
wherein he paints the marvels of his 
reign with the majestic picture of the 
government and religion which he esta- 
blished ! Who before our modern infi- 
dels ever ventured to obscure this in- 
contestable fact ? Who ever sprang a 
doubt about this among the Hebrews ? — 
What greatei- reasons have there ever 
been to attribute to Mahomet his Al- 
coran, to Plato his Republic, or to Ho- 
mer his sublime poems * Rather let us 
say. What work in any age ever ap- 
peared more truly to bear the name of 
Its real author ? It is not an ordinary 
book, which, like many others, may be 
easily hazarded under a fictitious name. 
It is a sacred book, which the Jews have 
always read with a veneration, that re- 
mains after seventeen hundred years 
exile, calamities, and reproach. In this 
book the Hebrews included all their 
science ; it was their civil, political, and 
sacred code, their only treasure, their 
calendar, their annals, the only title of 
their sovereigns and pontiffs, the alone 
rule of polity and worship : by conse- 
quence it must be formed with their 
monarchy, and necessarily have the 
same epoch as their government and

PERFECTION, that state or quali- 
ty of a thing, in which it is free from de- 
tect or redundancy. According to some, 
it is divided into physical or natural, 
wheieby a thing has all its powers and 
faculties ; moral, or an eminent degree 
of goodness and piety ; and metaphysi- 
cal or transcendant is the possession of 
all the essential attributes or parts ne- 
cessary to the integrity of a substance ; 
or it IS that whereby a thing has or is 
provided of every thmg belonging to its 
nature ; such is the perfection ot God. 
— The term perfection, says the great 
Witsius, is not always used in the same 
sense in the Scriptures. 1. There is a 
perfection of sincerity, whereby a man 
serves God without hypocrisy. Job i. 1. 
Is. xxxviii. 3. — 2. There is a pei'fection 
of parts, subjective with respect to the 
whole man, 1 Thess. v. 23. and objec- 
tive with respfect to the whole law, 
when all the duties prescribed by God 
are observed, Ps. cxix. 128. Luke i. 
6. — 3. There is a comparative perfec- 
tion ascribed to those who are advanced 
in knowledge, faith, and sanctification, 
in comparison of those who are still in- 
fants and untaught, 1 John ii. 13. 1 Cor. 
ii. 6. Phil. iii. 15. — 45. There is an evan- 
gelicdl perfection. The righteousness 
of Christ being imputed to the believer, 
he is complete in him, and accepted of 
God as perfect through Christ, Col. ii. 
10. Eph. v. 27. 2 Cor. v. 21.— 5. There 
is also a perfection of degrees, by which 



a person performs all the commands of 
God with the full exertion of all his 
powers, without the least defect.* This 
is what the law of God requires, but 
what the saints cannot attain to in this 
life, though we willingly allow them all 
the other kinds above-mentioned, Rom.

PERFECTIONS OF GOD. See 
Attributes. 

PERJURY is the taking of an oath, 
in order to tell or confirm a falsehood. 
This is a very heinous crime, as it is 
treating the Almighty with irreverence; 
denying, or at least discardmg liis om- 
niscience ; profaning his name, and vio- 
lating ti'uth. It has always been es- 
teemed a very detestable thing, and 
those who have been proved guilty of 
it, have been locked upon as the pests 
of society. See Oath. 

PERMISSION OF SIN. See Sin. 

PERSECUTION is any pain or af- 
fliction which a person designedly in- 
,flicts upon another ; and, in a more re- 
strained sense, the sufferings of Chris- 
tians on account of their religion. Per- 
secution is threefold. 1. Mental, when 
the spirit of a man rises up and opposes 
another. — 2. Verbal, when men give hard 
words and deal in uncharitable censures. 
— 3. Actual or open, by the hand, such 
as the dragging of innocent persons be- 
fore the tribunal of Justice, Matt. x. 18. 
The unlawfulness of persecution for 
conscience sake must appear plain to 
every one that possesses the least de- 
gree of thought or of feeling. " To ba- 
nish, imprison, plunder, starve, hang, 
and burn men for religion," says the 
shrewd Jortin, " is not the Gospel of 
Christ ; it is the Gospel of the Devil. 
Where persecution begins, Christianity 
ends. Christ never used any thing that 
looked like force or violence, except 
once; and that was to drive bad men 
out of the temple, and not to drive them 
in." 

We know the origin of it to be from 
the prince of darkness, who began the 
dreadfiil practice in the first family on 
earth, ana who, more or less, has been 
carrying on the same work ever since, 
and that almost among all parties. 
" Persecution for conscience sake," says 
Dr. Doddridge, is every way inconsis- 
tent, because, 1. It is founded on an ab- 
surd supposition, that one man has a 
right to judge for another in matters of 
rehgion. — 2. It is evidently opposite to 
that fundamental principle of morality ;

that we should do to others as we could 
reasonably desire they should do to us. — 
3. It is by no means calculated to an- 
swer the end which its patrons profess 
to mtend by it. — i. It evidently tends to 
produce a great deal of mischief and 
confusion in the world. — 5. The Chris- 
tian religion must, humanly speaking, 
be not only obsti-ucted, but destroyed, 
should persecuting principles universal- 
ly prevail. — 6. Persecution is so far from 
bemg required, or encouraged by the 
Gospel, that it is most dii'ectly contrary 
to many of its precepts, and indeed to 
the whole of it. 

The chief objects who have fell a prey 
.to this diabolical spirit have been Chris- 
tians; a short account of whose suffer- 
ings we shall here give, as persecuted 
by the Jews, Heathens, and those of the 
same name. 

Persecution of Christians by the Jews. 
Here we need not be copious, as the 
New Testament will inform the reader 
more particularly how the first Chris- 
tians suffered for the cause of truth. 
Jesus Christ himself was exposed to it 
in die greatest degree. The four evan- 
gelists record the dreadful scenes, which 
need not here be enlarged on. After 
his death, the apostles suffered every 
evil which the malice of the Jews could 
invent, and their mad zeal execute. 
They who read the Acts of the Apos- 
tles, will find that, like their Master, 
they were despised and rejected of 
men, and treated with the utmost indig- 
nity and contempt. 

II. Persecution of Christians by the 
Heathen. Historians usuall}' reckon ten 
general persecutions, the first of which 
was under the emperor Nero, thirty- 
one years after our Lord's ascension, 
when that emperor, having set fire to 
the city of Rome, threw the odium of 
that execrable action on the Christians. 
Fii'st. Those were apprehended who 
openly avowed themselves to be of that 
sect ; then by them were discovered an 
immense multitude, all of whom wei-e 
convicted. Their death and tortures 
were aggravated by cruel derision and 
sport ; for they were either covered 
with the skins of wild beasts and torn in 
pieces by devouring dogs, or fastened to 
crosses, and wrapped up in combusti- 
ble garments, that, when the day-light 
failed, they might, like torches, serve to 
dispel the darkness of the night. For 
this tragical spectacle Nero lent his own 
gardens ; and exhibited at the same 
time the public diversions of the circus ; 
sometimes driving a chariot in person, 
and sometimes standing as a spectator, 
while the shrieks of women burning to 



ashes supplied music for his eafs.— . 
2. The second general persecution was 
under Domitian, in the year 95, when 
40,000 were supposed to have suffered 
martyrdom. — 3. The third began in the 
third year of Trajan, in the year 100, 
and was canned on with great violence 
for several years. — 4. The fourth was 
under Antoninus, when the Christians 
were banished from their houses, forbid- 
den to show their heads, reproached, 
beaten, hurried from place to place, 
plundered, imprisoned, and stoned. — 
5. The fifth began in the year 127, un- 
der Severus, when great cruelties were 
committed. In this reign happened the 
martyrdom of Pei-petua and Felicitas, 
and their companions. Perpetua had an 
infant at the breast, and Felicitas was 
just delivered at the time of their being 
put to death. These two beautiful and 
amiable young women, mothers of in- 
fant children, after suffering much in 
prison, were exposed before an insult- 
ing multitude, to a wild cow, who man- 
gled their bodies in a most horrid man- 
ner : after which they were carried to 
a conspicuous place, and put to death by 
the sword. — 6. The sixth began with 
the reign of Maximinus, in 235. — 7. The 
seventh, which was the most dreadful 
ever known, began in 250, under the 
emperor Decius, when the Christians 
were in all places driven from their 
habitations, stripped of their estates, 
tormented with racks, &amp;c. — 8. The 
eighth began in 257, under Valerian. 
Both men and women suffered death, 
some by scourging, some by the sword, 
and some by fire. — 9. The ninth was 
under Aurelian, in 274 ; but this was in- 
considerable, compared with the othei's 
before-mentioned. — 10. The tenth began 
in the nineteenth year of Dioclesian, 
303. In this dreadful persecution, which 
lasted ten years, houses filled with Chris- , 
tians were set on fire, and whole droves 
were tied together with ropes, and 
thrown into the sea. It is related that 
17,000 were slain in one month's time ; 
and that during the coatinuance of this 
persecution, in the province of Egypt 
alone, no less than 144,000 Christians 
died by the violence of their persecu- 
tors ; besides 700,000 that died through 
the fatigues of banishment, or the pub- 
lic works to which they Avei'e con- 
demned. 

III. Persecution of C hristians by those, 
of the same name. Numerous were the 
persecutions of different sects from Con- 
stantine's time to the reformation ; but 
when the famous Martin Luther arose, 
and opposed the errors and ambition of 
the church of Rome, and the sentiments

of this good man began to spread, the 
pope and his clergy joined all their forces 
to hinder their progress. A general 
council of the clergy was called : this 
was the famous council of Trent, which 
was held for near eighteen successive 
years, for the purpose of establishing 
popery in greater splendour, and pre- 
venting the reformation. The friends to 
the reformation were anathematized and 
excommunicated, and the life of Lu- 
ther was often in danger, though at last 
he died on the bed of peace. From time 
to time imiumerable schemes were sug- 
gested to overthrow the reformed 
church, and wars were set on foot for 
the same purpose. The invincible ar- 
mada, as it was vainly called, had the 
same end in view. The inquisition, 
which was established m the twelfth 
century against the Waldenses (See 
Inquisition) was now more effectually 
set to work. Terrible persecutions 
were carried on in various parts of Ger- 
many, and even in Bohemia, which con- 
tinued about thirty years, and the blood 
of the saints was said to flow like rivers 
of water. The countnes of Poland, Li- 
thuania, and Hungary, were in a simi- 
lar manner deluged with Protestant 
blood. In 

HOLLAND, 
and in the other Low Countries, for 
many years the most amazing cruelties 
were exercised under the merciless and 
unrelenting hands of the Spaniards, to 
whom the inhabitants of that part of 
the world were then in subjection. Fa- 
ther Paul observes, that these Belgic 
martyrs were 50,000 ; but Grotius and 
others observe, that there were 100,000 
who suffered by the hand of the execu- 
tioner. Herein, however, Satan and his 
agents failed of their purpose; for in 
the issue gi-eat part of the Netherlands 
shook off the Spanish yoke, and erected 
themselves into a separate and inde- 

Eendent state, which has ever since 
een considered as one of the principal 
Protestant countries of the universe. 
FRANCE. 
No country, perhaps, has ever pro- 
duced more mai-tyrs than this. After 
many cruelties had been exercised 
against the Protestants, there was a 
most violent persecution of them in the 
year 1572, in the reign of Charles IX. 
Many of the principal Protestants were 
invited to Paris under a solemn oath of 
safety, upon occasion of the mamage of 
the king of Navarre with the French 
king's sister. The queen dowager of 
Navarre, a zealous Protestant, how- 
ever, was poisoned by a pair of gloves 
before the marriage was solemnized. 



Coligni, admiral of France, was basely 
murdered in his own house, and then 
thrown out of the .window to gratify the 
malice of the duke of Guise : his head 
was afterwards cut off, and sent to tjje 
king and queen-mother ; and his body, 
after a thousand indignities offered to it, 
hung by the feet on a gibbet. After 
this the murderers ravaged the whole 
city of Paris, and butchered in three 
da) s, above ten thousand lords, gentle- 
men, presidents, and people of a:ll ranks. 
A horrible scene of things, says Thua- 
nus, when the very sti eets and pas- 
sengers resounded with the noise of 
thuse that met together for murder and 
plunder; the groans of those who were 
dying, and the shrieks of such as were 
just going to be butchered, were eveiy 
where heard; the bodies of the slain 
thrown out of the windows ; the courts 
and chambers of the houses filled with 
them ; the dead bodies of others drag- 
ged through the streets; their blood 
running through the channels in such 
plenty, that torrents seemed to empty 
themselves in the neighbouring river; 
in a word, an innumerable multitude of 
men, women with child, maidens, and 
children, were all involved in one com- 
mon destruction ; and the gates and en- 
trances of the king's palace all be- 
smeared with their blood. From the 
city of Paris the massacre spread 
throughout the whole kingdom. In the 
city of Meaux they threw above two 
hundred into gaol ; and after they had 
ravished and killed a great number of 
women, and plundered the houses of the 
Protestants, they executed their fury on 
those they had imprisoned ; and calling 
them one by one, they were killed, as 
Thuanus expresses, like sheep in a 
market. In Orleans they murdered 
above five hundred, men, women, and 
children, and enriched themselves with 
the spoil. The same cruelties were 

Eractised at Angers, Troyes, Rouges, 
,a Charite, and especially at Lyons, 
where they inhumanly destroyed above 
eight hundred Protestants; children 
hanging on their parents' necks ; parents 
embracing their children ; putting ropes 
about the necks of some, dragging them 
through the streets, and throwing them, 
mangled, torn, and half dead, into the 
river. According to Thuanus, above 
30,0Q0 Protestants were destroyed in 
this massacre ; or, as otiiers affirm^ 
above 100,000. But what aggravates 
these scenes with still greater wanton- 
ness and" cruelty, was, the manner in 
which the news was received at Rome. . 
When the letters of the pope's legate 
v/ere read in the assemblv of the car- 



PER

PER 



dinals, by which he assured the pope 
that ail was transacted by the express 
will and command of the king, it was 
immediately decreed' that the pope 
sl^ould march with his cardinals to the 
church of St. Mark, and in the most so- 
lemn manner give thanks to God for so 
great a blessing conferred on the see of 
:ome and the Christian world; and 
that, on the Monday after, solemn mass 
should be celebrated in the church of 
Minerva, at which the pope, Gregory,' 

XIII. and cardinals were present ; and 
that a jubilee should be published 
throughout the whole Christian world, 
and the cause of it declared to be, to 
return thanks to God for the extirpa- 
tion of the enemies of the tnith and 
church in France. In the evening the 
cannon of St. Angelo were fired to tes- 
tify the public joy ; the whole city illu- 
minated with bonfires ; and no one sign 
of rejoicing omitted that was usually 
made for the gi-eatest victories obtained 
in favour of the Roman church ! ! ! 

But all these persecutions were, how- 
ever, far exceeded in cruelty by those 
which took place in the time of Louis 

XIV. It cannot be pleasant to any 
man's feelings, who has the least hu- 
manity, to recite these dreadful scenes 
of horror, cinielty, and devastation ; but 
to show what superstition, bigotry, and 
fanaticism, are capable of producing, 
and for the purpose of holding up the 
spirit of persecution to contempt, we 
shall here give as concise a detail as 
possible. The troopers, soldiers, and 
dragoons, went into the Protestants' 
houses, where they mari'ed and defaced 
their household stuff; broke their look- 
ing-glasses and other utensils ; threw 
about their com and wine ; sold what 
they could not destrov; and thus, in 
four or five days, the f rotestants were 
stripped of above a million of money. 
But this was not the worst : they turned 
the dining rooms of gentlemen into 
stables for horses, and treated the own- 
ers of the houses where they (quartered 
with the greatest ci-uelty, lashmg them 
about, not suffering them to eat or 
drink. When they saw the blood and 
sweat run down their faces, they sluiced 
them with water, and, putting over 
their heads kettle-drums turned upside 
down, they made a contuiual din upon 
them till these unhappy creatures lost 
their senses. At Negreplisse, a town 
near Montaubon, they hung up Isaac 
Favin, a Protestant citizen of that place, 
by his arm-pits, and tormented him a 
■whole night by pinching and tearing off 
his flesh with pincers. They made -a 
great fire i*ound about a boy, twelve 



years old, who, with hands and eyes 
lifted up to heaven, cried out, " My God, 
help me ! " and when they found the youth 
resolved to die rather than renounce his 
religion, they snatched him from the fire 
just as he was on the point of being 
burnt. In several places the soldiers 
applied red hot irons to the hands and 
feet of men, and the breasts of women. 
At Nantes, they hung up several wo- 
men and maids by their feet, and others 
by their arm-pits, and thus exp&gt; sed 
them to public view stark naked. They 
bound mothers, that gave suck, to posts, 
and let their sucking infants lie lan- 
guishing in their sight for several days 
and nights, crying and gasping for life. 
Some they bound before a great fire, 
and, being half roasted, let them go ; a 
punishment worse than death. Amidst 
a thousand hideous cries, they hung up 
men and women by the hair, and some 
by their feet, on hooks in chimneys, and 
smoked them with wisps of wet hay till 
they were suffocated. They tied some 
under the arms with ropes, and plunged 
them again and again mto wells ; they 
bound others, put them to the torture, and 
with a funnel filled them with wine till 
the fumes of it took away their reason, 
when they made them say they consent- 
ed to be Catholics. They stripped them 
naked, and, after a thousand indignities, 
stuck them with pins and needles from 
head to foot. In some places they tied 
fathers and husbands to their bed-posts, 
and, before their eyes, ravished their 
wives and daughters with impunity. 
They blew up men and women witn 
bellows till they burst them. If any, to 
escape these barbarities, endeavoured 
to save themselves by flight, they pur- 
sued them into the fields and woods, 
where they shot at them, like wild 
beasts, and prohibited them from de- 
parting the kingdom (a cnielty never 
practised by Nero or Dioclesian,) upon 
pain of confiscation of effects, the gal- 
leys, the lash, and perpetual imprison- 
ment. With these scenes of desolation 
and horror the popish clergy feasted 
their eyes, and made only matter of 
laughter and sport of them ! ! ! 

ENGLAND 
has also been the seat of much persecu- 
tion. Though Wickliffe, the first re- 
former, died peaceably in his bed, yet 
such was the malice and spirit of per- 
secuting Rome, that his bones were or- 
dered to be dug up, and cast upon a 
dunghill. The remains of this excellent 
man were accordingly dug out of the 
grave, where they had lain undisturbed 
four-and-forty years. His bones were 
burnt, and the ashes cast into an ad-

joining brook. In the reign of Henry 
VlII. Bilney, Bayman, and many other 
reformers were burnt ; but when queen 
Mary came to the throne, the most se- 
vere persecutions took place. Hooper 
and Rogers were bunit in a slow fire. 
Saunders was ci-uelly tormented a long 
time at the stake before he expired. 
Taylor was put into a barrel of pitch, 
and fire set to it. Eight illustrious per- 
sons, among whom was Ferrar, bishop 
of St. David's, were sought out, and burnt 
by the infamous Bonner in a few days. 
Sixty-seven persons were this year, 
A. D. 1555, bunit, amongst whom were 
the famous Protestants, Bradford, Rid- 
ley, Latimer, and Philpot. In the fol- 
lowing year, 1556, eighty-five persons 
were burnt. Women suffered ; and 
one, in the flames, which burst her 
womb, being near her time of deliveiy, 
a child fell from her into the fire, 
which behig snatched out by some of 
the observers more humane than the 
rest, the magistrate ordered the babe 
to be again thrown into the fire, and 
burnt. Thus even the unborn child was 
*Dumt for heresy ! O God, what is hu- 
man nature when left to itself ! Alas ! 
dispositions ferocious as infernal then 
reign, and usurp tlie heart of man ! The 
queen erected a commission court, 
which was followed by the destruction 
of near eighty more. Upon the whole, 
the number of those who suffered death 
for the reformed religion in this reign, 
were no less than two hundred and 
seventy-seven persons ; of whom were 
five bishops, twenty-one clergymen, 
eight gentlemen, eighty-four trades- 
men, one hundred husbandmen, labour- 
ei-s, and servants, fifty-five women, and 
four children. Besides these, there were 
fifty-four more under prosecution, seven 
of whom were whipped, and sixteen 
perished in pi-ison. Nor was the reign 
of Elizabeth free from this persecuting 
spii-it; If any one refused to consent to 
the least ceremony in worship, he was 
cast into prison, where many of the most 
excellent men in the land perished. 
Two Protestant Anabaptists were 
burnt, and many banished. She also, it 
is said, put two Brownists to deatli ; and 
though her whole reign was distin- 
guished for its political prosperity, yet 
It is evident that she did not undei-stand 
the rights of conscience ; for it is said 
that more sanguinary laws were made 
in her reign than in any of her pi'edeces- 
sors, and her hands were stamed with 
the blood both of Papists and Puritans. 
James I. succeeded Elizabeth : he pub- 
lished a proclamation, commanding all 
Protestants to conform strictlv, and 



without any exceptioii, to all the rites 
and ceremonies ot the church of Eng- 
land. Above five hundred clergy Avere 
immediately silenced, or degraded, for 
not complying. Some were excommu- 
nicated, and some banished the country. 
The Dissenters were distressed, cen- 
sured, and fined, in the Star-chamber. 
Two persons were burnt for heresj% one 
at Smithfield, and the other at Litch- 
field. Worn out with endless vexations, 
and unceasing persecutions, many re- 
tired into Holland, and from thence to 
America. It is witnessed by a judicious 
historian, that, in this and some follow- 
ing reigns, 22,000 persons were banish- 
ed from England by persecution to 
America. In Charles the First's time 
arose the persecuting Laud, who was 
the occasion of distress to numbers. Dr. 
Leighton, for writing a book against 
the hierarchy, was fined ten thousand 
pounds, peipetual imprisonment, and 
whipping. He was whipped, and then 
placed in the pillory ; one of his ears 
cut off, one side of his nose slit ; branded 
on the cheek with a red hot iron, with 
the letters S. S. whipped a second time, 
and placed in the pillorw A fortnight, 
afterwards, his sores being yet uncured, 
he had the other ear cut off, the other 
side of his nose slit, and the other cheek 
branded. He continued in prison till the 
long parliament set him at libertj-. 
Aljout four years afterwards, ^^illiam 
Prynn, a barrister, for a book he wrote 
against the sfiorts on the Lord's day, 
was deprived from practising at Lin- 
coln's lim, degraded trom his degree at 
Oxford, set in the pillory, had his ears 
cut off, imprisoned for life, and fined 
five thousand pounds. Nor were the 
Presbyterians, when their government 
came to be established in England, free 
from the charge of persecution. In 
1645 an ordinance was published, sub- 
jecting all who preached or wrote 
against the Presbyterian directory foi' 
public worship to a fine not exceeding 
fifty pounds; and imprisonment for a 
year, for the thiixl offehce, in using.the 
episcopal book of common prayer, even 
in a private family. In the following 
year the Presbyterians applied to Par- 
liament, pressing them to enforce itni' 
formity in religion, and to extirpate 
popei'y, prelacy, heresy, schism, &amp;c. 
but their petition was rejected ; yet in 
1648 the parliament, i-uled by them, 
published an ordinance against heresy, 
and determined that any person wHo 
maintained, published, or defended the 
following errors, should suffer death. 
These errors were, 1. Denying the 
being of a God. — 2. Denying his omiii-

presence, omniscience, 5cc. — 3. Denying 
the Trinity in any way. — 4. Denying 
that Christ had two natures.— .5. Deny- 
ing the resurrection, the atonement, the 
Scriptures. In Charles the Second's 
rei^n the act of uniformity passed, by 
which two thousand clergymen were 
deprived of their benefices. Then fol- 
lowed the conventicle act, and the Ox- 
ford act, under which, it is said, eight 
thousand persons were imprisoned and 
reduced to want, and manv to the grave. 
In this reign also, the Quakers were 
much persecuted, and numbers of them 
imprisoned. Thus we see hov? England 
has bled under the hand of bigotry and 
persecution ; nor was toleration enjoy- 
ed until William III. came to the 
throne, who showed himself a warm 
friend to the rights of conscience. The 
accession of the present roval family 
was auspicious to religious liberty ; and 
as their majesties have always befriend- 
ed the toleration, the spirit of persecu- 
tion has been long curbed. 
IRELAND 
has likewise been drenched with the 
blood of the Protestants, foily or fifty 
thousand of whom were cruelly mur- 
dered in a few days, in different parts 
of the kingdom, in the reign of Charles 
I. It began on the 23d of October, 
1611. Having secured the principal 
gentlemen, and seized their effects, they 
nmrderetl the common people in cold 
blood, forcing manj' thousands to fly 
fi-om their houses and settlements na- 
ked into the bogs and woods, where they 
perished witli hunger and cold. Some 
they whipped to death, others they 
stripped naked, and exposed to shanie, 
and then drove them like herds of 
swine to perish in the mountains : many 
hundreds were drowned in rivers, some 
had their throats cut, others were dis- 
membered. With some the execrable 
villains made themselves sport, trying 
who could hack the deepest into an En- 
glishman's flesh : wives and young vir- 
gins abused in the presence of their 
nearest relations ; nay, they taught their 
children to strip and kill the children of 
the English, and dash out their brains 
against the stones. Thus many thou- 
sands were massacred in a few days, 
without distmction of age, sex, or quality, 
before they suspected their danger, or 
had time to provide for their defence. 
SCOTLAND, SPAIN, &amp;c. 
Besides the above-mentioned perse- 
cutions, there have been several others 
carried on in different parts of the 
world. Scotland for many }'ears together 
has been the scene of .cruelty and blood- 
shed, till it was delivered by the nio- 



narch at the revolution. Spain, Italy, 
and the valley of Piedmont, and other 
places, have been the seats of much 
persecution. Popery, we see has had 
the greatest hand in this mischievous 
work. It has to answer, also, for the 
lives of millions of Jews, Mahometans, 
and barbarians. When the Moors 'con- 
quered Spain, in the eighth centurj', 
they allowed the Christians the free ex- 
ercise of their religion ; but in the fif- 
teenth century, when the Moors were 
overcome, and Ferdinand subdued the 
Moriscoes, the descendants of the above 
Moors, many thousands were forced to 
be baptised, or burnt, massacred, or 
banished, and the children sold for 
slaves; besides innumerable Jews, who 
shared the same cinielties, chiefly by 
means of the infernal courts of inquisi- 
tion. A worse slaughter, if possible", 
was made among the natives of Spanish 
America, where fifteen millions arc 
said to have been sacrificed to the ge- 
nius of popery in about forty years. It 
has been computed that fifty millions of 
Protestants have at different times been . 
the victims of the persecutions of the 
Papists, and put to death for their I'e- 
ligious opinions. Well, therefore, might 
the inspired penman say, that at mystic 
Babylon's destruction, ' was found m her 
the blood of prophets, of saints, and of 
all that was slain upon the earth,' Rev. 
xviii. 24. 

I'o conclude this article. Who can 
peruse the account here given without 
feeling the most painful emotions, and 
. dropping a tear over the madness and 
depravity of mankind ? Does it not show 
us what human beings are capable of 
when influenced by superstition, bi- 
gotry, and prejudice ? Have not these 
baneful principles metamorphosed men 
into infernals ; and entirely extinguish- . 
ed all the feelings of humanity, the dic- 
tates of conscience, and the voice of 
reason ? Alas ! what has sin done to 
make mankind such curses to one ano- 
ther ? Merciful God ! by thy great 
power suppress this worst of all evils, 
and let truth and love, meekness and 
forbearance universally prevail ! Lim-

PERSEVERANCE is the continu- 
ance in any design, state, opinion, or 
course of action. The perseve«'ance of 
the saints is their continuance in a state 
of grace to a state of glory. This doc- 
trine has aflForded considerable matter 
for controversy between the Calvinists 
and Arminians. We sliall briefly here 
state the arguments and ol^ections. 
And, first, the perfections of God are 
considered as strong argv\pnents to prove 
this doctrine. God, as a Being possess- 
ed of infinite love, faithfuhiess, wisdom, 
and power, can hardly be supposed to 
suffer any of his people finally to fall 
into perdition. This would be a re- 
flection on his attributes, and argue him 
to be worse than a common father of 
his family. His /ot'e to his people is 
unchangeable, and therefore they can- 
not be the objects of it at one time and 
not at another, John xiii. 1. Zeph. iii. 
17. Jer. xxxi. 3. His faithfulness to 
them and to his promise is not founded 
upon their merit, but his own wUl and 
goodness : this, therefore, cannot be vio- 
lated, Mai. iii. 6. Numb, xxiii. 19. His 
wisdom foresees every obstacle in the 
way, and is capable of removing it, and 
directing them into the right path. It 
would be a reflection on his wisdom, af- 
ter choosing a right end, not to choose 
right means in accomplishing the same, 
Jer. X. 6, 7. His fioiver is insuperable, 
and is absolutely and perpetually dis- 
played in their preservation and pro- 
tection, 1 Peter i. 5. — 2. Another argu- 
ment to prove this doctrine is their union 
to Christ, and what he has done for 
them. They are said to be chosen in 
him, Eph. i. 4. united to him, Eph. i. 23. 
the purchase of his death, Rom. viii. 34. 
^it. ii. 14 ; the objects of his interces- 
sion, Rom. v. 10. Rom. viii. 34. 1 John 
iL 1, 2. Now if there be a possibility of 
their finally falling, then tliis choice, 
this union, his death and intercession, 
may all be in vain, and rendered abor- 
tive ; an idea as derogatory to the di- 
vine glory, and as dishonourable to Je- 
sus Christ, as possibly can lie. — 3. It is 
argued, from the tuorlc of the Spirit, 
which is to communicate grace and 
strength equal to the day, Phil. i. 6. 2 
Cor. i. 21j 22. If, indeed, divine grace 
were dependent on the will of man, if 
by his own power he had brought him- 
self into a state of grace, then it might 
follow that he might relapse into an op- 
posite state when that power at any 
time was weakened } but as the perse- 



verance of the saints is not produced by 
any native principles in themselves, but 
by the agency of the Holy Spirit, en- 
lightening, confirming, and establishing 
them, of course, they must persevere, 
or otherwise it would be a reflection on 
this Divine agent, Rom. viii. 9. 1 Cor 
vi. 11. John iv. 14. John xvi. 14. — 4. 
Lastly, the declarations and promises ot 
Scripture are very numerous in favour 
of this doctrine, Job xvii. 9. Psal. xciv. 
14. Psal. cxxv. Jer. xxxii. 40. John x. 
28. John xvii. 12. 1 Cor. i. 8, 9. 1 Pet 
i. 5. Prov. iv. 18. all which could not 
be true, if this doctrine were false 
There are objections, however, to this 
doctrine, which we must state. — 1. 
There are various threatenings de- 
nounced against those who apostatize, 
Ezek. iii. 20. Heb. vi. 3, 6. Psal. cxxxv. 
3. — 5. Ezek. xviii. 24. To this it is an- 
swered, that some of these texts do not 
so much as suppose the falling away of 
a tnaly good man ; and to all of them, it 
is said, that they only show what would 
be the consequence // such should fall 
away ; but cannot prove that it ever in 
fact happens. — 2. It is foretold as a fu- 
ture event that some should fall away. 
Matt, xxiv. 12, 13. John xv. 6. Matt. 
xiii. 20, 21. To the first of these pas- 
sages it is answered, that their love 
might be said to wax cold without to- 
tally ceasing ; or there might have been 
an outward zeal and show of love where 
there never was a true faith. To the 
second it is answered, that persons may 
be said to be in Christ only by an exter- 
nal profession, or mere members of the 
visible church, John xv. 2. Matt. xiii. 
47, 48. As to Matthew, ch. xiii. v. 20, 
21. it is replied, tliat this may refer to 
the joy with which some may entertain 
the oners of pardon, who never, af- 
ter all, attentively considered them.^ — 3. 
It is objected that many have in fact 
fallen away, as David, Solomon, Peter, 
Alexander, Hymeneus, &amp;c. To which 
it is answered, that David, Solomon, and 
Peter's fall, were not total; and as to 
the others, there is no proof of their 
ever being tnae Christians. — 4. It is 
urged, that this doctrine supersedes the 
use of means, and renders exhortations 
unnecessary. To which it may be .an- 
swered, that perseverance itself implies 
the use of means, and that the means 
are equally appointed as well as the 
end: nor has it ever been found that 
true Christians have rejected them. 
They consider exhortations and admo- 
nitions to be some of the means they are 
to attend to m order to promote their 
holiness : Christ and his apostles, though 
they often asserted this doctrine, yet re^

proved, exhorted, and made use of 
means. See Exhortation, Means. — 
.5. Lastly, it is objected that this doc- 
trine gives great encouragement to car- 
nal security and presumptuous sin. To 
which it is answered, that this doctrine, 
like many others, may be abused, by 
hypocrites, but cannot be so bj' those 
who are truly serious, it being the very 
nature of grace to lead to righteousness. 
Tit. ii. 10, 12. Their knowledge leads 
to veneration ; their love animates to 
duty ; their faith purifies the heart ; 
their gratitude excites to obedience; 
yea, all their principles have a tendency 
to set before them the evil of sin, and 
the beauty of holiness. See IVJiilby and

PERSON, an individual substance of 
a rational intelligent nature. Some have 
been offended at the term persons as 
applied to the Trinity, as unwarrantable. 
The term fierson, when applied to 
.Deity, is certainly used in a sense some- 
what different from that in which we 
apply to one another; but when it is 
considered that the Greek words 
fjroo-Tao-ii and Ylqocusnov, to which it an- 
swers, are, in the New Testament, ap- 
plied to the Father and Son, Heb. i. 3. 
2 Cor. iv. 6. and that no single term, at 
least, can be found more suitable, it can 
hardly be condemned as unscriptural 
and improper. There have been wai'm 
debates between the Greek and Latin 
churches about the words hyfiostasis 
and fiersona ; the Latin concluding that 
the word hyfiostasis signified substance 
or essence, thought that to assert that 
there were three divine hy/iostases was 
to say that there were three gods. On 
the other hand, the Greek church 
thought that the word /leison did not 
sufficiently guard against the ^Sabellian 
notion of the same individual Being 
sustaining three relations ; whereupon 
each pait of the church was ready to 
brand the other with heresy, till by a 
free and mutual conference m a synod 
at Alexandria, A. D. 362, they made it 
appear that it was but a mere conten- 
tion about the grammatical sense of a 
word ; and then it was allowed by men 
of temper on both sides, that either of 
the two words might be indifferently 
used. See Marci Medulla, 1. 5. J 3 ;

the S/iirit, p. 140; Doddrige's Lec-

PERSUASION, the act of influencing 
the judgment and passions by arguments 
or moti\ es. It is different from con- 
viction. Conviction affects the under- 
standing only ; persuasion the will and 
the practice. It may be considered as 
an assent to a proposition not sufficient- 
ly proved. It is more extensively used 
than conviction, which last is founded on 
demonstration natural or supernatural. 
But all things of which we may be 
persuaded, are not capable of demon- 
stration. See Blair's Rhetoric, vol. ii. 
p. 174. 

PETER-PENCE, was an annual tri- 
bute of one penny paid at Rome out of 
every family at the feast of St. Peter. 
This, Ina, the Saxon king, when he went 
in pilgrimage to Rome, about the year 
740, gave to the pope, partly as alms, 
and partly in recompence of a house 
erected in Rome for English pilgrims. 
It continued to be paid generally until 
the time of king Henry VIII. when it 
was enacted, that henceforth no persons 
shall pay any pensions, peter-pence, or 
other impositions, to the use of the bi- 
shop and see of Rome. 

PETITION, according to Dr. Watts, 
is the fourth part of prayer, and includes 
a desire of deliverance from evil, and a 
request of good things to be bestowed. 
On both these accounts petitions are to 
be offered up to God, not only for 
ourselves, but for our fellow-creatures 
also. This part of prayer is- frequently 
called intercession. See Prayer. 

PETROBRUSSIANS, a sect founded 
about the year 1110 in Languedoc and 
Provence, by Peter de Bruys, who made 
the most laudable attempts to reform 
tlie abuses and to remove the supersti« 
tions that disfigured the beautifiU sim- 
plicity of the Gospel ; though not with- 
out a mixture of fanaticism. The fol- 
lowing tenets were held by him and his 
disciples : 1. That no persons whatever 
were to be baptized before they were 
come to the full use of their reason. — 2. 
That it was an idle superstition to build 
churches for the service of God, who 
will accept of a sincere worship where- 
ever it is offered ; and that, therefore, 
such churches as had already been 
erected, v^^ere to be pulled down and 
destroyed. — 3. That the crucifixes, as 
instruments of superstition, deserved 
the same fate. — 4. That the real body 
and blood of Christ were not exhibited 
in the eucharist, but were meraly re-

presented in that ordinance. — 4. That 
the oblations, pra}ers, and good works 
of the living, could be in no respect ad- 
vantageous to the dead. The founder 
of this sect, after a laborious ministry of 
twenty years, was burnt in the year 
1130 by an enraged populace set on by 
the clergy, whose traffic was in danger 
from the entei-prising spirit Qf this new 
reformer. 

PETROJOANNITES were follow- 
ers of Peter John, or Peter Joannis, that 
is, Peter the son of John, who flourished 
in the twelfth century.' His doctrine 
was not known till after his death, when 
his body was taken out of his gi-ave, and 
burnt. His opinions were, that he alone 
had the knowledge of the true sense 
•wherein the apostles preached the 
Gospel ; that the reasonable soul is not 
the form of man ; that there is no grace 
infused by baptism ; and that Jesus 
Christ was pierced with, a lance on the 
ci'oss before he expired. 

PHARISEES, a famous sect of the 
Jews who distinguished themselves by 
their zeal for the traditions of the el- 
ders, which they derived from the same 
fountain with the written word itself; 
pretending that both were delivered to 
Moses from Mount Sinai, and were 
therefore both of equal authority. From 
their rigorous observance of these tra- 
ditions, they looked upon themselves as 
more holy than other men, and there- 
fore separated themselves from those 
whom they thought sinners or profane, 
so as not to eat or drink with them ; 
and hence, from the Hebrew word 
fiharis, which signifies "to separate," 
they had the name of Pharisees, or Se- 
fiharatists. 

This sect was one of the most ancient 
and most considerable among the Jews, 
but its original is not very well known ; 
however, it was m great repute in the 
time of our Saviour, and most probably 
had its original at the same time with 
the traditions. 

The extraordinary pretences of the 
Pharisees to righteousness, dre^ after 
them the common people, who held 
them in the highest esteem and vene- 
ration. Our Saviour frequently, how- 
ever, charges them with hypocrisy, and 
making the law of God of no effect 
tlirough their traditions, Matt. ix. 12. 
Matt. XV. 1, 6. Matt, xxiii. 13, 33. Luke 
xi. 39, 52. Sevei-al of these traditions 
are particularly mentioned in the Gos- 
pel ; but they had a vast number more, 
which may be seen in the Talmud, the 
whole subject whereof is to dictate and 
explain those traditions which this sect 
imposed to be believed and observ^ed. 



The Pharisees, contrary to the opinion 
of the Sadducees, held a resurrection 
from the dead, and the existence of an- 
gels and spirits. Acts xxiii. 8. But, ac- 
cording to Josephus, this resurrection of 
theirs was no more than a Pythagorean 
.resun-ection, that is, of the soul only, 
by its transmigration into another body, 
and being bom anew with it. From this 
resurrection they excluded all who 
were notoriously wicked, being of opi- 
nion that the souls of such persons were 
transmitted into a state of everlasting 
wo. As to lesser crimes, they held 
they were punished in the bodies which 
the souls of those who committed them 
wei'e next sent into. 

Josephus, however, either mistook 
the faith of his countrymen, or, which is 
more probable, wilfully misrepresented 
it, to render their opinions more re- 
spected by the Roman philosophers, 
whom he appears to have, on every oc- 
casion, been desirous to please. The 
Pharisees had many Pagan notions re- 
specting the soul ; but Bishop Bull, in 
his Harmonia Afxostolica, has clearly 
proved that they held a resurrection of 
the body, and that they supposed a cer- 
tain bone to remain uncorrupted, to 
furnish the matter of which the resur- 
rection body was to be foi-med. They 
did not, however, believe that all man- 
kind were to be raised from the dead. 
A resurrection was the privilege of the 
children of Abraham alone, who were 
all to rise on Mount Zion ; their incor- 
ruptible bones, wherever they might be 
buried, being carried to that mountain 
below the surface of the earth. The 
state of futui'e felicity in which the 
Pharisees believed was very gross; they 
imagined that men in the next world, 
ao well as in the present, were to eat 
and drink, and enjoy the pleasures of 
love, each being re-united to his former 
wife. Hence the Sadducees, who be- 
lieved in no resurrection, and supposed 
our Saviour to teach it as a Pharisee, 
very shrewdly urged the difficulty of 
disposing of the woman who had in this 
world been the wife of seven husbands. 
Had the resurrection of Christianity 
been the Pharisaical resurrection, this 
difficulty would have been insurmount- 
able ; and accordingly we find the peo- 
ple, and even some of the Pharisees 
themselves, stiiick with the manner in 
which our Saviour removed it. 

This sect seems to have had some 
confused notions, probably derived from 
the Chaldeans and Persians, respecting 
the pre-existence of souls; and hence 
it was that Christ's disciples asked him 
concerning the blind man, John ix. 2.

*' Who did sin, this man, or his parents, 
that he was bom blind?" And when 
the disciples told Christ that some said 
he was Elias, Jeremias, or one of the 
prophets, Matt. xvi. 14. the meaning 
can only be, that they thought he was 
come into the world with the soul of 
Elias, jeremias, or some other of the 
old prophets transmigrated into him. 
With the Essenes they held absolute 
predestination, and with the Sadducees 
tree wUl ; but how they reconciled these 
seemingly incompatible doctruies is no 
where sufficiently explained. The sect 
of the Phai-isees was not extinguished 
by the ruin of the Jewish commonwealth. 
The greatest part of the modern Jews 
are still of this sect, being as much de- 
voted to traditions, or the oral law, as 
their ancestors were. 

PHILADELPHIAN SOCIETY, a 
sect or society of the seventeenth cen- 
tury ; so called from an English female, 
whose name was Jane Leadley. She 
embi-aced, it is said, the same views and 
the same kind of religion as Madame 
Bourignon (See Bourignonists.) She 
was of opinion that all dissensions among 
Christians would cease, and the king- 
dom of the Redeemer become, even 
here below, a glorious scene of charity, 
concord, and felicity, if those who bear 
the name of Jesus, without regarding 
the forms of doctrine or discipline that 
distinguish particular communions, 
would all join in committing their souls 
to the care of the internal guide, to be 
instnicted, governed, and formed bv his 
divine impulse and suggestions. Nay, 
she went still farther, and declared, in 
the name of the Lord, that this desira- 
ble event would actually come to pass, 
and that she had a divine commission to 
proclaim the approach of this glorious 
communion of saints, who were to be 
gathered in one visible universal church 
-or kingdom before the dissolution of this 
earthly globe. This prediction she de- 
livered with a peculiar degree of confi- 
dence, from a notion that her Philadel- 
phian society was the true kingdom of 
Christ, in which alone the Divine Spirit 
resided and reigned. She believed, it is 
said, the doctrine of the final restoration 
of all intelligent beings to perfection and 
happiness. 

PHILANTHROPY, compounded of 
^,\os, and av9j(07ro5, which signify the love 
of mankind. It differs fi'om benevo- 
lence only in this : that benevolence ex- 
tends to every being that has life and 
sense, and is of course susceptible of 
pain and pleasure ; whereas philanthro- 
py cannot comprehend more th;m the 
kuman race, it differs from friendship, 



as this aflFection subsists only between a 
few individuals, whilst philanthropy 
comprehends the whole human species. 
It is a calm sentiment, which perhaps 
hardly ever rises to the warmtn of af- 
fection, and certainly not to the heat of 
passion. 

PHILIPISTS, a sect or party among 
the Lutherans, the followers of Philip 
Melancthon. He had strenuously op- 
posed the Ubiquists, who arose m his 
time ; and, the dispute growing still 
hotter after his death, the university of 
Wittemburg, 'who espoused Melanc- 
thon's opinion, were called by the Flac- 
cians, who attacked it, Philifiisls. 

PHILOSOPHISTS, a name given to 
several persons in France who entered 
into a combination to overturn the reli- 
gion of Jesus, and eradicate from the hu- 
man heart every religious sentiment. 
The man more particularly to whom this 
idea first occuiTed was Voltaire, who be- 
ing weary (as he said himself) of hearing 
people repeat that twelve men were suf^ 
ncient to establish Christianity, resolved 
to prove that one might be sufficient to 
overturn it. Full of this project, he 
swore before the year 1730 to dedicate 
his life to its accomplishment ; and, for 
some time, he flattered himself that he 
should enjoy alone the glory of destroy- 
ing the Christian religion. He found, 
however, that associates would be ne- 
cessary ; and from the numerous tribe 
of his admirers and disciples he chose 
D'Alerftbert and Diderot as the most 
proper persons to co-operate with him 
m nis designs. But Voltaire was not 
satisfied with their aid alone. He con- 
trived to embark in the same cause 
Frederic II. king of Prussia, who wish- 
ed to be thought a philosopher, and 
who, of course, deemed it expedient to 
talk and write against a religion which 
he had never studied, and into the evi- 
dence of which he had probably never 
deigned to inquire. This royal adept 
was one of the most zealous of Voltaire's 
coadjutors, till he discovered that the 
])hilosAphists were waging war with the 
throne as well as with the altar. This, 
indeed, was not originally Voltaire's in- 
tention. He was vain : he loved to be 
caressed by the great ; and, in one word, 
he was, from natural disposition, an 
aristocrat, and an admirer of royalty. 
But when he found that almost every so- 
vereign but Frederic disapproved of his 
impious projects, as soon as he perceived 
their issue, he determined to oppose 
all the governments on earth rather than 
forfeit the glory with which he had flat- 
tered himself of vanquishing Christ and 
his apostles in the field of controvers) .

He now set himself, with D'Alem- 
bert and Diderot, to excite universal 
discontent with the established order of 
things. For this purpose they formed 
secret societies, assumed new names, 
and employed an enigmatical language. 
Thus Frederic was called Luc; D'Al- 
embei% Protagoras, and sometimes 
Bertrand; Voltaire, Raton; and Di- 
derot, Platan, or its anagram Tonfila; 
while the general term tor the conspi- 
rators was Cacoucc. In their secret 
■meetings they professed to celebrate 
the mysteries of Mythra; and their 
gi-eat object, as they professed to one 
another, was to confound the ■ wretch, 
meaning Jesus Christ. Hence their se- 
cret watch-word was Ecrasez I'Infame, 
" Crush Christ." If we look into some 
of the books expressly written for ge 
neral circulation, we shall there find 
the following doctrines ; some of them 
standing alone in all their naked hor- 
rors, others surrounded by sophistry 
and meretricious ornaments, to entice 
the mind into their net before it per- 
ceives their nature, " The Universal 
" Cause, that god of the philosophers, 
" of the Jews, and of the Christians, is 
" but a cliimera and a phantom. The 
" phenomena of nature only prove the 
" existence of God to a. few firepossessed 
" men : so far from bespeaking a God, 
" they are but the necessary effects of 
" matter prodigiously diversified. It is 
" more reasonable to' admit, with Manes, 
" of a two-fold God, than of the God of 
" Christianity. W'e cannot know whe- 
" ther a God really exists, or whether 
" there is the smallest difference be- 
" tween good' and evil, or vice and vir- 
" tue. Nothing can be more absurd 
" than to believe the soul a spiritual be- 
" ing. The immortality of the soul, so 
" far fi-om stimulating maft to the prac- 
" tice of virtue, is nothing but a barba- 
" rous, desperate, fatal tenet, and con- 
" trary to all legislation. All ideas of 
"justice and injustice, of virtue and 
" vice, of gloiy and infamy, are purely 
" arbitrary, and dependent on custom. 
" Conscience and remorse are nothing 
" but iheforesight of those physical pe- 
" nalties to which crimes expose us. 
" The man who is above the law .can 
" commit, without remorse, the disho- 
" nest act that may serve his purpose. 
" The fear of God, so far from being 
" the beginning of wisdom, should be 
" the beginning of folly. The command 
" to love one's parents Is more the work 
" of education than of nature. Modesty 
" is only an invention of refined volup- 
" tuousness. The law which condemns 
" married people to live together, be- 



" comes barbarous and cniel on the day. 
" they cease to love one another." — 
These extracts from the secret corres- 
pondence and the public writings of 
these men, will suffice to show us the 
nature and tendency of the dj:eadful 
sj^stem they had formed. 

The phil'osophists were dihgently em- 
ployed m attempting to propagate their 
sentiments. Their grand Encyclopaedia 
was converted into an engine to serve 
this purpose. Voltaire proposed to 
establish a colony of philosophists at 
Cleves, who, protected by the king of 
Prussia, might publish their opinions 
without dread or danger ; and Frederic 
was disposed to take them under his 
protection, till he discovered that their 
opinions were anarchical as well as im- 
pious, when he threw them off, and even 
wrote against them. They contrived, 
however, to engage the ministers of the 
court of France in their favour, by pre- 
tending to have nothing in view but the 
enlargement of science, in works which 
spoke indeed respectfiiUy of revela- 
tion, while every discoveiy which they 
brought forward was meant to under- 
mine its veiy foundation. When the 
throne was to be attacked, and even 
when barefaced atheism was to be pro- 
mulgated, a number of impious and li- 
centious pamphlets were dispersed (for 
some time none knew how-) from a se- 
cret society formed at the Hotel d'Hol- 
bach, at Pai'is, of which Voltaire was 
elected honorary and perpetual presi- 
dent. To conceal their real design, 
which was the diffusion of their infidel 
sentiments, they called themselves Eco- 
nomists. See (Economists. The books, 
however, that were issued from this 
club were calculated to impair and over- 
tui-n religion, morals, and government; 
and which indeed, spreading over all 
Europe, imperceptibly took possession 
of public opinion. As' soon as the sale 
was sufficient to pay the expenses, infe- 
I'ior editions were printed, and given 
away or sold at a very low price ; circu- 
lating libraries of them formed, and 
reading societies instituted. While they 
constantly denied these productions to 
the world, they contrived to gi\'e them 
a false celebrity throitgh their confiden- 
tial agents, and correspondents, who 
were not themselves always trusted 
with the entire secret. By degrees they 
got possession nearly of all the review^ 
and periodical publications, estabhshed 
a general intercourse by means of hawk- 
ers and pedlars with the distant pro- 
vinces, and instituted an office to supply 
all schools with teachers ; and thus did 
they acquire unprecedented dominion

over every species of literature, over 
the minds of all ranks of people, and 
over tlie education of youth, without 
giving any alarm to the world. The 
lovers of wit and polite literature were 
caughtby Voltaire ; the men of science 
were perverted, and children corrupted 
in the first rudiments of learning; by 
D'Alembert and Diderot ; stronger ap- 

getites were fed by the secret club of 
aron Holbach; the imaginations of the 
higher orders were set dangerously 
afloat by Montesquieu ; and the multi- 
tude of^ all ranks was surprised, con- 
founded and hurried away by Rousseau. 
Thus was the public mind in France 
completely corrupted, and which, no 
doubt, greatly accelerated those dread- 
ful events which have since transpired 
in that country. 

PHILOSOPHY properly denotes 
love, or desire of wisdom (from cpiKas and 
cctpia.) Pythagoras was the first who 
devised this name, because he thought 
no man was wise, but God only ; and 
that learned men ought rather to be 
considered as lovers of wisdom tlian 
really wise. 1. Katural philosojihy is 
that art or science which leads us to 
conteniplate the natui'e, causes, and ef- 
fects of the material works of God. — 
2. Moral Jihilosofihij is the science of 
manners, the knowledge of our duty and 
felicity. The various articles included 
in the latter, are explained in their 
places in this work. 

PHOTINIANS, a sect of heretics, in 
the fourth century, who denied the dj- 
\inity of our Lord. They derive their 
name from Photinius, their founder, who 
was bishop of Sermium, and a disciple 
of Marcellus. Photinius published in 
the year 343, his notions respecting the 
Deity, which were repugnant both to 
the orthodox and Arian systems. He 
asserted that Jesus Christ was born of 
the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary ; 
that a certain divine emanation, which 
he called the Word, descended upon 
him ; and that, because of the union of 
the Divine Word with his human na- 
ture, he was called the Son of God, and 
(jven God himself; and that the Holy 
Ghost was not a person, but merely a ce- 
lestial virtue proce'eding fron the Deity. 

PHRYGL\NS, or Cataphrygian's, 
a sect in the second century ; so called, 
as being of the country of Phrygia. They 
wpre orthodox in every thing, setting 
aside this, that they took Montanus for 
a prophet, and Priscilla and M-iximilla 
for true prophetesses, to be consulted 
in every thing relating to, religion; as 
supposing the Holy Spirit had abandon- 
ed the church. See Montanists. 



PHYLACTERY, in the general, was 
a name given by the ancients to all kinds 
of charms, spells, or characters, which 
they wore about them, as amulets, to 
preserve them from dangers or dis- 
eases. 

PAz/Zar/'fjT/ particularly denoted a slip 
of parchment, wherein was written some 
text of holy Scripture, paiticularly of 
the decalogue, which the more devout 
people among the Jews wore at the 
forehead, tlie breast, or the neck, as a 
mark of their religion. 

The primitive christians also gave the 
name Phylacteries to the cases wherein 
they enclosed the relics of their dead. 
Phylacteries are often mentioned in the 
New Testament, and appear to have 
been very common among the Pharisees 
in our Lord's time. 

PICARDS, a sect which arose in 
Bohemia, in ■ the fifteenth century. Pi- 
card, the author of this sect, from whom 
't derived its name, drew after him, as 
has been generally said, a number of 
men and women, pretending he would 
restore them to the primitive state of 
innocence wherein man was created ; 
and accordhigly he assumed the title of 
JVenu Adam. V\'ith this pretence, lie 
taught, to give themselves up to all im- 
purity, saying, that therein consisted the 
liberty of the sons of God, and all those 
not of their sect were in bondage. He 
first publislied his notions in Germany 
and the Low Countries, and persuadea 
many people to go naked, and gave 
them the name of Adamites. After 
this, he seized on an island in the river 
Lausnecz, some leagues from Thabor, 
tlie head-quarters of Zisca, where he 
fixed himself and his followers. His 
women were common, but none were 
allowed to emoy them without his per- 
mission ; so tlfat when any man desired 
a particular woman, he carried her to 
Picard, who gave him leave in these 
words : Go, increase, multifily, and Jill 
the earth. At length, however, Zisca, 
general of the Hussites (famous for his 
victories over the emperor Sigisrnond,) 
hurt at their abominations, marched 
against them, made himself master of 
their island, and put them all to death 
except two, whom he spared, that he 
miglit lean; their doctrine. 

Such is the account wMch various 
wi-iters, I'elying on the authorities of 
.^neas, Sylvius, and Varillas, have given 
of the Picards. Some, however, doubt 
whether a sect *of this denomination, 
chargeable with such wild principles 
and such licentious conduct, ever exist - 
ed. It appears probable that the re- 
proachful representations 6f the writer .-

just mentioned, were calumnies invent- 
ed and propagated in order to disgrace 
the Picards, merely because they de- 
serted the communion, and protested 
against the errors of the church of 
Rome, Lasitus informs us, tliat Picard, 
together with forty other persons, be- 
sides women and children, settled in 
Bohemia, in the year 1418. Balbinus, 
the Jesuit, in his £,pitome Rerum Bohe- 
micarum, lib. ii. gives a similar accoimt, 
and charges on the Picards none of the 
extravagances or crimes ascribed to 
them by Sylvius. Schlecta, secretary 
of Ladislaus, king of Bohemia, in his 
letters to Erasmus, in which he gives a 
particular account of the Picards, says, 
that they considered the pope, cardi- 
nals, and bishops of Rome as the true 
antichrists ; and the adorers of the con- 
secrated elements in the eucharist as 
downright idolaters ; that they denied 
the corporeal presence of Christ in this 
ordinance : that they condemned the 
•worship of saints, prayers for the dead, 
auricular confessions, the penance im- 
posed by priests, the feasts and vigils 
observed in the Romisli church ; and 
that they confined themselves to the ob- 
sei-vance of the sabbath, and of the two 
great feasts of Christmas and Pente- 
cost. From this account it appears that 
they were no other than the Vaudois 
that fled from pei-secution in their own 
country, and sought refuge in Bohemia. 
M. De' Beausobre has shown that they 
were both of the same sect, though un- 
der different denominatipns. — Besides, it 
is certain that the Vaudois were settled 
in Bohemia in the year 1178, where 
some of them adopted the rites of the 
Greek, and others .those of the Latin 
church. The former were pretty ge- 
nerally adhered to till the middle of the 
fourteenth century, when the establish- 
ment of the Latin rites caused great 
disturbance. On the commencement of 
the national troubles in Bohemia, on ac- 
count of the opposition of the papal 
power, the Picards more publicly avow- 
ed and defended • their religious opi- 
nions ; and they formed a considerable 
body in an island by the river Launitz, 
or Lausnecz, in the district of Bechin, 
and, recurring to arms, were defeated 
by Zisca. 

PIETISTS, a religious sect that sprung 
up among the Protestants in Germany 
bi the latter end of the seventeenth cen- 
tury. Pietism was set on foot by the 
pioiis and learned Spener, who, by the 
private societies he formed at Francfort 
with a design to promote vital religion, 
roused the lukewarm from their indif- 
ference, and excited a spirit of vigour 



and resolution in those who had been 
satisfied to lament in silence the pro- 
gress of impiety. Tlie remai-kable ef- 
fect of these pious meetings was in- 
creased by a book he published under 
the title ot Pious Desires, in which he 
exhibited a striking view of the disor- 
ders of the church, and proposed the re- 
medies that were pi*oper to heal them. 
Many persons of good and upright in- 
tentions were highly pleased both with 
the proceedings and writings of Spener; 
and, indeed, the greatest part of those 
who had the cause of viitue and practi- 
cal religion truly at heai't, applauded 
the*designsof this good man, though an 
apprehension of abuse retained numbers 
from encouraging them openly. These 
abuses actually happened. The reme- 
dies proposed by Spener to heal the dis- 
orders of the church fell into unskilful 
hands, wei'e administered without saga- 
city or prudence, and thus, in many 
cases, proved to be worse than the dis- 
ease itself. Hence complaints arose 
against these institutions of pietism, as 
if, under a striking appearance of sancti- 
ty, they led the people into false notions 
of religion, and fomented in those who 
were of a turbulent and violent charac- 
ter, the seeds and principles of mutiny 
and sedition. 

These complaints would have been 
undoubtedly Hushed, and the tumults 
they occasioned would have subsided by 
degrees, had not the contests that arose 
at Leipsic in the year 1689, added fuel to 
the flame. Certain pious and learned 
professors of philosophy, and particu- 
larly Franckius, Schadlus, and Paulus 
Antonius, the disciples of Spener, who 
at that time was ecclesiastical superin- 
tendent of the couit of Saxony, began to 
consider with attention the defects that 
prevailed in the ordinary method of in- 
structing the candidates for the minis- 
try ; and this review persuaded them 
of the necessity of using their best en- 
deavours to supply what was wanting, 
and correct what was amiss. For this 
puipose they undertook to explain in* 
their colleges certain books of holy Scrip- 
ture, in order to render these genuine 
sources pf religious knowledge better un- 
derstood, and to promote a spirit of 
practical piety and vital religion in the 
minds of their hearers. The novelty of 
this method drew attention, and .ren- 
dered it singularly pleasing to many; 
accordingly, these lectures were much 
frequented, and their effects were visi- 
ble in the lives and conversations of se- 
veral persons, whom they seemed to in- 
spire with a deep sense of the impor- 
tance of religion and virtue. Many

things, however, it is said, t\'erc done in 
these Biblical Colleges (as they were 
called,) which, though they may be 
looked upon by equitable and candid 
judges as worthy of toleration and in- 
dulgence, were nevertheless, contrary 
to custom, and far from being consist- 
ent with prudence. Hence rumours 
were spread, tumults excited, animosi- 
ties kindled, and the matter at length 
brought to a public trial, in whicli the 
pious and learned men above-mentioned 
were, indeed, declared free from the er- 
rors and heresies that had been laid to 
their charge, but were, at the same 
time, prohibited from carrying on the 
plan of religious Jtistruction they had un- 
dertaken with such zeal. It was during 
these ti-oubles and divisions that the in- 
\'idious denomination of Pietists was 
first invented ; it may, at least, be af- 
firmed, that it was not commonly known 
before this period. It was at first ap- 
plied by some giddy and inconsiderate 
persons to those who frequented the 
Biblical Colleges, and li\'ed ni a manner 
suitable to the instructions and exhorta- 
tions that Avere addressed to them in 
these seminaries of piety. It was after- 
wards made use of to characterize all 
those who were either distinguished by 
the excessive austerity of their man- 
ners, or who, regardless of truth and 
ofimion, were only intent upon /uxictice, 
and turned the whole vigour of their ef- 
forts towards the attainment of religious 
feehngs and habits. But as it is the fate 
of all those denominations by which pe- 
culiar sects arc distinguished, to be va- 
riously and often very improperly ap- 
plied, so the title of Pietists was fre- 
quently gi\ en in con\mon conversation, 
to persons of eminent wisdom and sanc- 
tity, who were equally remarkable for 
their adherence to truth, and their love 
of piety ; and, not seldom, to persons, 
whose "motley characters exhibited an 
enormous mixture of profligacy and en- 
thusiasm, and who deserved the title of 
delirious fanatics better than any other 
• denomination. 

This contest was by no means con- 
fined to Leipsic, but spread with incre- 
dible celeritv through all the Lutheran 
churches in the different states and king- 
doms of Eurojje. For from this time, 
in all the cities, towns, and villages, 
whej'e Lutheranism was professed, there 
started up, all of a sudden, persons of 
various ranks and professions, of both 
sexes, who declared that they were 
"called bv JV divine imfiulse, to pull up 
iniquity by the root ; to restore to its pri- 
mitive' lustre, and propagate through 
the world, the declining cause of piety 



and virtue; to govern the church of 
Christ by wiser rules than those by which 
it was at present directed ; and who, 
partly in their writings, and partly in 
their private and jjublic discourses, 
pointed out the means and measures that 
were necessary to bring about this im- 
portant revolution. Several religious 
societies were formed in various places, 
which, though they differed in some cir- 
cumstances, and were not all conduct- 
ed and composed with equal wisdom, 
piety, and prudence, were, however, de- 
signed to promote the same general 
purpose. In the mean time, these unu- 
sual proceedings filled with uneasy and 
alarming apprehensions both those who 
were intrusted with the government of 
the church, and those who sat at the 
helm of the state. These apprehen- 
sions were justified by this important 
consideration, that the pious and well- 
meaning persons who composed these 
assemblies, had indiscreetly admitted 
into their community a parcel of extra- 
vagant and hot-headed fanatics, who 
foretold the approaching destruction of 
Babel (by which they meant the Lu- 
theran church,) terrified the populace 
with fictitious visions, assumed the au- 
thority of prophets honoured Avith a di- 
vine commission, obscured the sublime 
truths of religion by a gloomy kind of 
jargon of their own invention, and re- 
vived doctrines that had long before 
been condemned by the churcn. The 
most violent debates arose in all the 
Ijutheran churghes ; and persons whose 
differences were occasioned rather by 
mere words and questions of little con- 
sequence, tlian by any doctrines or in- 
stitutions of considerable importance, 
attacked one another with the bitterest 
animosity ; and, in many countries, se- 
vere laws were ut length enacted against 
the Pietists. 

These revivers of piety were of two 
kinds, who, by their different manner of 
proceeding, deserve to be placed in two 
distinct classes. One sect of these prac- 
tical reformers proposed to cany on 
their plan without introducing any 
change into the doctrine, discipline, or 
form of government, that were estab- 
lished in the Lutheran church. The 
other maintained, on the conti-ary, that 
it was impossible to promote the pro- 
gress of real piety among the Lutherans 
without making considerable alterations 
in their doctrine, and changing the 
whole form of their ecclesiastical dis- 
cipline and polity. The former had at 
their head the learned and pious Spener, 
who, in the year 1691, removed from 
Dresden to Berlin, and whose senti-

xnents were adopted by the professors 
of the new academy of Hall ; and par- 
ticularly by Francklus and Pauhis Anto- 
ninus, who had been invited thithei- from 
Leipsic, where they began to be sus- 
pected of pietism. Though few pre- 
tended to treat eitl\er with indignation 
or contempt, the intentions and purposes 
of these good men (which indeed, none 
could despise without affecting to ap- 
pear the enemy of practical religion and 
virtue,) yet many eminent divines, and 
more especially the professors and pas- 
tors of Wittenberg, were of opinion, 
that, in the execution of this laudable 
purpose, several maxims were adopted, 
and certain measures employed, that 
were prejudicial to tiie truth, and also 
detrimental to the interests of the 
church. Hence they looked on them- 
selves as obliged to proceed publicly 
against Spenei', in the year 1695, and af- 
terwards against his disciples and ad- 
herents, as the inventors and promoters 
of erroneous and dangei'ous opinions. 
These debates are of a recent date ; so 
that those who are desirous of knowing- 
more particularly how far the princi- 
ples of equity, moderation, and can- 
dour, influenced the minds and directed 
the conduct of the contending parties, 
may easily receive satisfactory infor- 
mation. These debates turned upon 
a variety of points, and therefore the 
matter of them cannot be comprehend- 
ed under any one general head. If Ave 
consider them, indeed, in relation to 
their, origin, and the circumstances tliat 
gave rise to them, we shall tlien be able 
to reduce tliem to some lixed principles. 
It is well known, that those who had the 
advancement of piet}' most zealously at 
heart, were possessed of a notion that 
no order of men contriljtited more to re- 
tard its progress than the clergy, whose 
peculiar vocation it was to inculcate 
and promote it. I^ooking upon this as 
the root of the evil, it was but natural 
that their plans of reformation should 
begin here ; and accordingly, they laid 
it down as an essential principle, that 
none should be admitted nito the minis- 
try but such as had receiA ed a proper 
education, were distinguished by their 
wisdom and sanctity of m.anners, and had 
hearts filled with divine love. Hence 
they proposed, in the ^first place, a 
thorougli reformation of the schools of 
divinity ; and they explained clearly 
enough what they meant by this re- 
formation, which consisted in the fol- 
lowing points : That the systematic 
theology which reigned in the acade- 
mies, and was composed of intricate and 
disputable doctiines, and obscure and 



unusual forms of expression, should be 
totally aliolished ; tliat polemical di- 
vinity, which comprehended the con- 
troversies subsisting between Christians 
of diiferent communions, should be less 
eagerly studied, and less frequently 
treated, though not entirely neglected i 
that ail mixture of philosophy and hu - 
rrian learning with divine wisdom, was 
to be most carefully avoided ; that, on 
tlic contrary, all those who were de- 
signed ifor tlie ministry, should be ac- 
customed from their early youth to the 
perusal and study of the holy Scrip- 
tures; that they should be taught a 
plain S)stem of theology, drawn from 
these unerring somxes of truth ; and 
that the whole course of their education 
was to be so directed as to render them 
useful in life, by the practical power of 
their doctrine, and the commanding in- 
fluence of their example. As these 
maxim s were propagated, with the great- 
est industry and zeal, and were ex- 
plained inadveitentl}-, by some, without 
those restrictions which pnidence seem- 
ed to require, these professed patrons 
and revi\ers of piety were susijected of 
designs that could not but render them 
obnoxious to censure. They were sup- 
posed to despise philosophy and learn- 
ing ; to treat with indifference, and even 
to I'cnounce, all inquiries hito the na- 
ture and foundations of religious truth ; 
to disapprove of the zeal and labours of 
those who defended it against such as 
either cormpted or opposed it ; and to 
place the whole of their theology in cer- 
tain vai;^s and incoherent declamations 
concerning the dr.ties of moralit}'. Hence 
arose those famous disputes concerning 
the use of philosophy, and the value ot 
human learning, considered in connexion 
with the interest of religion, the dignity 
and usefulness of systematic theology, 
the necessity of polemic divinity, the ex- 
cellence of the mystic system, and also 
concerning the true method of instruct- 
ing the people. 

The second great object that em- 
ployed the zeal and attention of \\\f 
persons now under consideration, was, 
that the candidates for the ministrv 
shoidd not only for the . future reoeiv'e 
such an academical education as would 
tend rather to solid utility tlian to mere 
speculation, but also that they should 
dedicate (/lemseh'cs to God in a pecidiar 
manner, and exhibit the most striking 
examples of piety and virtue. This 
maxim, which, when considered in it-, 
self, must be considered to he higlily 
laudable, not only gave occasion to se- 
veral new regulations, designed to re- 
strain the passions of the studious vouth.

to inspire them with pious sentiments 
and to excite in them holy resolutions, 
but also produced another maxim, which 
was a lasting source of controversy and 
debate, viz. " That no person that was 
" not himself a model of piety and di- 
" vine love, was qualified to be a pubUc 
" teacher of piety, or a guide to others 
" in the way of salvation." This opi- 
nion was considered by many as dero- 
gatory from the power and efficacy of 
the word of God, which cannot be de- 
prived of its divine influence by the vices 
of its ministers ; and as a soil of revival 
of the long-exploded errors of the Do- 
natists : and what rendered it peculi- 
arly liable to an interpretation of this 
nature, was the imprudence of some 
Pietists, who inculcated and explained 
it without those restrictions that were 
necessary to render it unexceptionable. 
Hence arose endless and intricate de- 
bates concerning the following ques- 
tions : " Whether the religious know- 
" ledge acquired by a wicked man can 
" be termed theology .'"' " Whether a 
" vicious person can, in effect, attain a 
" true knowledge of religion ?" " How 
" far the ofiice and ministry of an im- 
" pious ecclesiastic can be pronounced 
" salutary and efficacious ?" " Whether 
" a licentious and ungodly man cannot 
" be susceptible of illumination i"' and 
other questions of a like nature. 

These revivers oi declining piety went 
still farther. In order to render the mi- 
nistry of their pastors as successful as 
possible in rousing men from their indo- 
lence, and in stemming the torrent of 
corruption and immorality, they judged 
two things indispensably necessary. 1 he 
first was, to suppress entirely, in the 
course of public mstruction, and more 
especially in that delivered from the 
pulpit, certain maxims and phrases 
M'hich the corruption of men leads them 
frequently to interpret in a manner fa- 
vourable to the indulgence of their pas- 
sions. Such, in the judgment of the 
Pietists, were the following propositions: 
Mo man is able to attain to that fierfec- 
tion which the divine law requires : 
Good works are not necessarii to salva- 
tion : In the act of justiftca'tion, on the 
part of man, faith alone is concerned, 
without i(ood works. The second step 
they took in order to give efficacy to 
their plans of reformation, was, to form 
new rules of life and manners, much 
more rigorous and austere than those 
that had been formerly practised ; and 
to place in the class of sinful and uii- 
lawful gratifications, several kinds of 
pleasure and amusement whicli had hi- 
therto been looked upon as hmocent in 



themselves, and which could only be- 
come good or evil in consequence of the 
respective diaracters of those who used 
them with prudence, or abused them 
with intemperance. Thus, dancing, 
pantomimes, public sports, theatrical 
di^'ersions, the reading of humorous and 
comical books, with several other kinds 
of pleasure and enteitainment, were 
prohibited by the Pietists as unlawful 
and unseemly, and therefore by no 
means of an indifferent nature. The 
third thing on which the Pietists insist- 
ed, was, that, besides the stated meet- 
ings foi- public worship, private assem- 
blies should be held for prayer and other 
religious exercises. 

The other class of Pietists already 
mentioned, whose refonning views ex- 
tended so far as to change the system of 
doctrine, and the form of ecclesiastical 
government that were established in the 
Lutheran church, comprehended per- 
sons of various characters, and different 
ways of thinking. Some of them were 
totally destitute of judgment ; their er- 
rors were the reveries of a disordered 
brain ; and they wei'e rather consider- 
ed as lunatics than as heretics. Others 
were less extravagant, and tempered 
the singular notions they had derived 
from reading or meditation, with a cer- 
tain mixture of the important truths 
and doctrines of religion. 

So far Mosheim, whose account of the 
Pietists seems to have been drawn up 
with a degree of severity. Indeed, he 
represents the real character of Franck 
and his colleagues as regardless of truth 
and opinion. A more recent historian, 
however, (Dr. Haweis,) observes, " that 
no men more rigidly contended for, or 
taught more explicitly the fundamental 
doctrines of Christianity : from all I 
have read or known, I am disposed to 
believe they were remarkably amiable 
in their behaviour, kind in their spirit, 
and compassionate to the feeble-mind- 
ed." 

PIETY consists in a firm belief, and 
in right conceptions of the being, per- 
fections, and providence of God ; with 
suitable affections to him, resemblance 
of his moral perfections, and a constant 
obedience to his will. The different ar- 
ticles included in this definition, such as 
knowledge, veneration, love, resigtiation, 
&amp;c. are explained in their proper places 
in this work. 

We shall, however, present the read- 
er with a few ideas on the subject of 
early fxiety ; a subject of infinite impor- 
tance, and which we beg our young read- 
ers especially to regard. " Youth," says 
Mr. Jay, "is a period which presents 



PIE 



453 



PIE 



the fewest obstacles to the practice of 
godliness, whether we consider our 
external circumstances, our nature, 
powers, or our moral habits. In that 
season we are most free from those 
troubles which imbitter, those schemes 
which engi"oss, those engagements 
which hinder us in more advanced and 
connected life. Then the body possess- 
es health and strength ; the memory is 
receptive and tenacious ; the fancy 
glows ; the mind is lively and vigorous ; 
the understanding is more docile ; the 
affections are more easily touched and 
moved : we are more accessible to the 
influence of joy and sorrow, hope and 
fear : we engage in an enterprise with 
more expectation, and ardour, and zeal. 
Under the legal oeconomy, the Jirst was 
to"be chosen for God ; the Jirst-borii of 
man, the Jirst-boiTi of beasts, the first- 
fruits of the field. It was an honour 
becoming the God they worshipped, to 
serve him first. This duty the young 
alone can spiritualize and fulfil, by giving 
Him who deserves all their lives the 
first-born of their days, and the first- 
fruits of their reason and their affec- 
tion : and never have they such an op- 
portunity to prove the goodness of their 
motives as they then possess. See an 
old man : what does he offer ? His 
riches ? but he can use them no longer. 
His pleasures ? but he can enjoy them 
no longer. His honour * but it is wither- 
ed on his brow. His authority ? but it 
has dropped from his feeble hand. He 
leaves his sins ; but it is because they 
will no longer bear him company. He 
flies from the world ; but it is because 
he is burnt out. He enters the temple ; 
but it is as a sanctuary ; it is only to 
take hold of the horns of the altar ; it is 
a refuge, not a place of devotion, he 
seeks. But they' who consecrate to 
him their youth, they do not pi-ofanely 
tell him to suspend his claims till the 
rest are served, till they have satisfied 
the world and the flesh, his degrading 
rivals. They do not send him forth to 
gather among the stubble the gleanings 
of life, after the enemy has secured the 
harvest. They are not like those, who, 
if they reach Immanuel's land, are 
forced thither by shipwreck : they sail 
thither by intention. 

" Consider the beneficial influence of 
early piety over the remainder of our 
days. Youth is the spring of life, and 
by this will be determined the glory of 
•summer, the abundance of autumn, the 
provision of winter. It is the morning 
of life, and if the sun of righteousness 
does not dispel the moral mists and 
fogs before noon, the whole day ge- 



nerally remains overspread and gloomy. 
Piety in youth will have a good influ- 
ence over our bodies ; it will preserve 
them from disease and deformity. Sin 
variously tends to the injury of health ; 
and often by intemperance the constitu- 
tion is so impaired, that late religion is 
unable to restore what early religion 
would have prevented. Early piety- 
will have a good influence to secure us 
from all those dangers to which we are 
exposed in a season of life the most pe- 
rilous. Conceive of a youth entering a 
world like this, destitute of the presid- 
ing governing care of religion, his pas- 
sions high, his pnidence weak, impa- 
tient, rash, confident, without expe- 
rience ; a thousand avenues of seduction 
opening around him, and a syren voice 
singing at the entrance of each ; pleased 
with appearances, and embracing them 
for realities, joined by ev.il company, 
and ensnared by erroneous publications : 
these hazards exceed all the alarm I 
can give. How necessary', therefore, 
that we should trust in the Lord with 
all our hearts, and lean not to our own 
understanding ; but in all our ways ac- 
knowledge him, that he may direct our 
paths ! 

" Early piety will have a beneficial 
influence in forming our connexions, 
and establishing our plans for life. It 
will teach us to ask counsel of the Lord, 
and aiTange all under the superintend- 
ency of scripture. Those changes 
which a person who becomes religious 
in manhood is obliged to make, art al- 
ways very embarrassing. With what 
difficulty do some good men establish 
family worship, after living in the view 
of children and servants, so long in the 
neglect of it ! — but this would have been 
avoided, had they early followed the ex- 
ample of Joshua : ' As for me and my 
house we will serve the Lord.' How 
hard is it to disentangle ourselves from 
associates with whom we have been long 
familiar, and who ha\x proved a snare 
to our souls ! Some evils, indeed, arc 
remediless ; persons have formed alli- 
ances which they cannot dissolve : but 
they did not walk by the i-ule, ' Be ye 
not unequally yoked together with un- 
believers :' they are now wedded to 
misery all their days ; and repentance, 
instead of visiting them like a faithful 
friend, to chide them when they do 
wrong, and withdraw, is quartered 
upon them for life. An early dedication 
to God, therefore, renders a religious 
life more easy, pleasant, and safe. It is 
of unspeakable advantage also under 
the calamities of life. It tunis the curse 
into a blessing; it enters the house of

fnouming, and soothes the troubled 
mind; it prepares us for all, sustains us 
in all, sanctifies us by all, and delivers 
us from all. Finally, it will bless old 
age : we shall look back with pleasure 
on some instances of usefulness ; to some 
poor traveller, to whom w^ have been 
a refreshing stream ; some deluded 
wanderer we guided into the path of 
peace. We shall look forward, and see 
the God who has guided us with his 
counsel, and be enabled to say, ' Hence- 
forth there is laid up for me a crown of 
righteousness, which the Lord, the right- 
eous Judge, shall give me at that day ; 
and not to me only, but unto all them 
tliat love his appearing.' " Jay^s Ser.

PILGRIM, one wlio travels through 
foreign countries to visit holy places, 
and to pay his devotion to the relics of 
dead saints. The -word is formed from 
the Flemisli pelgrim, or Italian, pele- 
grino, which signifies the sanie ; and 
tliose originally trom the Latin /zere^r/- 
r.us, a sti'anger or traveller. 

PILGRIMAGE, a kind of religious 
discipline, which consists in taking a 
journey to some holy place, in order to 
adore the relics of some deceased saint. 
Pilgi'images began to be made about the 
middle ages of the church, but they 
Avere most in vogue after tlie end of the 
eleventh century, when every one was 
for visiting places of devotion, not ex- 
cepting kings and princes ; and even 
bishops made no difficulty of being ab- 
sent trom their churches on the same 
account. The places most visited were 
Jerusalem, Rome, Tours, and Compos- 
tella. As to the latter place, we find 
that in .the year 1428, under the reign 
of Henry VI. abundance of licences were 
granted by the crown of England to 
captains ci" English ships, for carrying 
numbers of devout persons thither to 
the shrin« of St. James's ; provided, 
however, tiiat those pilgrims should first 
take an oath not to take any thing pre- 
judicial to England, nor to reveal any of 
its secrets, nor to carry out with tliem 
£ny more gpld or silver than what would 
be sufficient for their reasonable ex- 
penses. In'this year there went thither 
from England on the said pilgrimage, 
the foUowiiig number of persons : from 
London 280, Bristol 200, Weymouth 
122, Dartmouth 90, Yarmoutli 60, Jer- 
sey 60, Plyrpouth 40, Exeter 30, Poole 
24, Ipswich ^20 ; in all, 926 persons. Of 
late years the greatest numbers have 
resorted toLoretto, in order to visit tiie 



chamber . of the Blessed Virgin, in 
which she was born, and brought up 
her son Jesus till he was twelve years 
of age. 
In almost every country where po- 

f)ery has been established, pilgrimages 
lave been common. In England, the 
shrine of St. Thomas-a-Becket was 
the chief resort of the pious, and in 
Scotland, St. Andrews, where, as tradi- 
tion informs us, was deposited a leg of 
the holy apostle. In Ireland they have 
been contmued even down to modem 
times ; for from the beginning of May 
till the middle of August every year, 
crowds of popish penitents from all 
parts of that country resort to an island 
near the centre of the Lo ugh Fin, or 
White Lake, in the county of Donegal, 
to the amount of 3000 or 4000. Thesfe 
are mostly of the poorer sort, and many 
of them are proxies, for those who are 
richer; some of whom, howcA'er, to« 
gether with some of the priests and bi- 
shops on occasion, make their appear- 
ance there. When the pilgrim comes 
within sight of the holy lake, he must 
unco\-er his hands and feet, and thus 
walk to the water side, and is taken to 
the island for sixpence. Here there are 
two chapels and fifteen other houses; 
to which are added confessionals so con- 
tri\'ed, that the priest cannot see the 
person confessing. The penance va- 
ries according to tlie circumstances of 
the penitent ; during the continuance of 
which (which is sometimes three, six, 
or nine days) he subsists on oatmeal, 
sometimes made into bread. He tra- 
verses sharp stones on his bare knees or 
feet, fuid goes through a variety of other 
forms, paying sixpence at every differ- 
ent confession. When all is over, the 
priest bores a gimblet hole through the 
top of the pilgrim's staft", in which he 
fastens a cross peg ; gives him as many 
holy pebbles out of tlie lake as he cares 
to carry away, for amulets to be prcr 
sented to his friends, and so dismisses 
him an object of veneration to all other 
Papists not thus initiated ; who no 
sooner see the pilgrim's cross in h'ls 
hands, than they kneel down to get his 
blessing. 

There are, however, it is said, other 
paits of Ireland sacred to extraordinary 
worship and pilgrimage ; and the num- 
l)er of holy wells, and miraculous cures, 
&amp;c. produced by them, are very great. 
That such things should exist in this 
enlightened age, and in a protestant 
country, is indeed strange ; but our 
wonder ceases when we reflect it is 
among the lowest, and perhaps the 
worst of the people. Pilgrimage, ho-w-

ever, is not peculiar to Roman catholic 
countries. The Mahometans place a 
great part of their religion in it. Mecca 
is the grand place to which they go ; and 
this pilgrimage is so necessary a point of 
practice, that, according to a tradition of 
Mahomet, he who dies without perform- 
ing it, may as well die a Jew or a Chris- 
tian; and the same is expressly com- 
manded in the Koran. 

What is principally reverenced in 
this place, and gives sanctity to the 
whole, is a squai-e stone building, called 
the Caaba. Before the time of Ma- 
homet this temple was a place of wor- 
ship for the idolatrous Arabs, and is 
said to have contained no les-s than three 
hundred and sixty different images, 
equalling in number the days of the 
Arabian year. They were all destroyed 
by Mahomet, who sanctified the Caaba, 
and appointed it to be the chief place of 
worship for all true believers. The 
Mussulmen pay so great a veneration to 
it, that they believe a single sight of its 
sacred walls, without any particular act 
of devotion, is as meritorious in the siglit 
of God as the most careful discharge of 
one's duty for the space of a whole 
year, in any other temple. 

To this temple every Mahometan 
who has health and means sufficient, 
ought once, at least, in his life, to go on 
pilgrimage ; nor are women excused 
from the performance of this duty. The 
pilgrims meet at different places near 
Mecca, according to the dift'erent parts 
from whence they come, during the 
months of Shawal and Dhu'lkaada, being 
obliged to be there by the beginning of 
Dhu'lhajja; which month, as its name 
impoits, is peculiarly set apart for the 
celebration of this solemnity. 

The men put on the Ibram, or sacred 
habit, which consists only of two woollen 
wi-appers, one wrapped about the mid- 
dle, and the other thro\vn over their 
shoulders, having their heads bare, and 
a kind of slippers which cover neither 
the heel nor the instep, and so enter the 
sacred territory in their way to Mecca. 
While they have this habit on, they must 
neither hunt nor fowl (though they are 
allowed to fish ;) which precept is so 
punctually observed, that they will not 
kill vermin if they find them on their 
bodies: there are some noxious animals, 
however, which they have permission 
to kill during the pilgrimage ; as kites, 
ravens, scorpions, mice, and dogs given 
to bite. During the pilgrimage, it be- 
hoves a man to have a constant guard 
over his words and actions ; to avoid all 
quarrelling or ill language, all converse 
with women; and all obscene discourse ; 



and to apply his whole attention to the 
good work he is engaged in. 

The pilgrims being arrived at Mecca, 
immediately visit the temple, and thai 
enter on the performance of the pre- 
scribed ceremonies, which consist chief- 
ly in going in procession round.the Caa- 
ba, in running between the mounts 
Safa and Meriva, in midting the station 
on mount Arafat, and slaying- the vic- 
tims and shaving their heads in the val- 
ley of Mina. • 

In compassing the Caaba, which they 
do seven times, Beginning at the corner 
where the black stone is fixed, they use 
a short, qui^^k pace the first three times 
they go round it, and a grave ordinary 
pace the four last; which it is said is 
ordered by Mahomet, that his followers 
might show themselves strong and ac- 
tive, to cut off the hopes of the infidels, 
who gave out that the immoderate heats 
of Medina had rendered them weak. 
But the aforesaid quick pace they are 
not obliged to use every time they per- 
form this piece of deN'otion, but only at 
some particular times. So often as 
they pass by the black stone, they either 
kiss it, or touch it with their hand, and 
kiss that. 

The running between Safa and Meri- 
va is also performed seven times, partly 
with a slow pace, and partly running; 
for the^ walk gravely till they come to 
a place between two pillars ; and there, 
they mil, and afterwards walk again, 
sometimes looking back, and sometimes 
stopping, like one who had lost some- 
thing, [o represent Hagar seeking water 
for hei' son ; for the ceremony is said to 
be as ancient as her time. 

On the ninth of Dhu'lhajja, after 
morning prayer, the pilgrims leave the 
vallcT of Mina, whither they come the 
day ijefore, and proceed in a tumultuous 
and' rushing manner to mount Arafat, 
wheie they stay to perform their devo- 
tions till sun-set; then they go to Moz- 
dalifa, an oratory between Arafat, and 
Mina, and there spend the night in 
prayfcr and reading the Koran. The 
next morning by day-break they visit 
jll ilasher al Karam, or the sacred 
montiment ; and, departing thence be- 
fore, sun-rise, haste by Batn Mohasser 
to the valley of Mina, where they throw 
seveji stones at three marks or pillars, 
in imitation of Abraham, who, meeting 
the devil in that place, and being by 
hirh disturbed in his devotions, or tempt- 
ed to disobedience when he was going 
to sacrifice his son, was commanded by 
God to drive him away by throwing 
stones at him; though others pretend 
this rite to' be as old as Adam, who also

put the devil to flight in the same place, 
and bv the siime means. 

The ceremony being over, on the 
same day, the tenth of Dhu'lhaj ja, the 
pilgrims slay their victims in the said 
valley of. Mma, of which they and their 
friends eat part, and the rest is given to 
the poor. These victims must be either 
sheep, goats, kine, os camels ; males, if 
of either of the two former kinds, and 
females if of either of the latter, and of a 
fit age. The sacrifices being over, they 
shave their heads and cut their nails, 
burying them in the s'ame place; after 
which the pilgrimage is looked on as 
completed, though they again visit the 
Caaba, to take their leave of that sacred 
building. 

Dr. Johnson gives us some observa- 
tions on pilgrimage, which are so much 
to the pui-pose, that we shall here pre- 
sent them to the reader. " Pilgrimage, 
like many other acts of piety, may be 
reasonable or superstitious according to 
the principles upon which it is pei-form- 
ed. Long journej^s in search of truth 
are not commanded: truth, such as is 
necessary to the regulation of life, is al- 
ways found where it is honestl^( sought, 
change of place is rib natural cause of 
the increase of piety, for it inevitaljly 
produces dissipation of mind. Yet, 
since men go every day to \Aew the 
fields where great actions ha\e been 
performed, and return with stronger 
impressions of the event, curiosit/ of the 
same kind may naturally dispose us to 
view that country whence our religion 
had its beginning. That the Supreme 
Being may be more easily propitiited in 
one place than in another, is the dream 
of idle superstition ; but that some 
places may operate upon our own minds 
m an uncommon manner, is an opinion 
Avhich hourly experience will justify. 
He who supposes that his vices may be 
more successfully combated in Pales- 
tine, will, perhaps, find himself mis- 
taken ; yet he may go thither without 
folly : he who thinks they will be more 
freely pardoned, dishonours at once his 
reason and his religion." Johriso?i\

England. See Crusade. 

Poor Pilgrims, an order that started 
up in the year 1500. They came oat of 
Italy into Germany bare-footed, and 
bare-headed, feeding all the week, ex- 
cept on Sundays, upon herbs and roots 
sprinkled with salt. They stayed hot 
above twenty-four hours ui a plav-e. 
They went by couples begging from 
door to door. This penance they un- 
dertook voluntarily, some for thi-ec, 
others for five or seven years, as they 



pleased, and then returned home to 

their callings. 

PIOUS FRAUDS are those artifices 
and falsehoods made use of in propa- 
gating the ti-uth, and endeavouring to 
promote the spiritual interests of man- 
kind. These have been more particu- 
larly practised in the church of Rome, 
and considered not only as innocent, but 
commendable. Neither the term nor 
the thing signified, however, can be jus- 
tified. The terms /iJOMS axiA fraud form 
a solecism; and the practice of doing 
evil that good may come, is directly 
opposite to the injunction of the sacred 
Scriptures, Rom. lii. 8. 

PITY is generally defined to be the 
uneasiness we feel at the unhappiness of 
another, prompting us to compassionate 
them, with a desire of their relief. 

God is said to pity them t^at fear 
him, as a father pitieth his children. 
The father, says iVir. Henry, pities his 
children that are weak in knowledge, 
and in-itructs them ; pities them when 
they are froward, and bears with them ; 
l&gt;ities them when they are sick, and com- 
forts them, Isa. Ixvi. 13 ; when they are 
fallen, and helps them up again ; when 
they have offended, and forgives them ; 
when they are wronged, and rights them. 
Thus the Lord pitieth them that fear 
him. Ps. ciii. 13. See Compassion of 
God. 

PLASTIC NATURE, an absurd doc- 
trine, which some have thus described. 
" It is an incoi-poreal created substance 
endued with a vegetative life, but not 
with sensation or thought ; penetrating 
the whole created universe, being co- 
extended with it; and, under God, 
moving matter, so as to pi'oduce the 
phenomena which cannot oe solved by 
mechanical laws: active for ends un- 
known to itself, not being expressly 
conscious of its actions, and yet having 
an obscure idea of the action to be en- 
tered upon." To this it has been an- 
swered, that, as the idea itself is most 
obscure, and, indeed, inconsistent, so th6 
foundation of it is evidently weak. It is 
intended by this to avoid the inconve- 
niency of subjecting God to the trouble 
of some changes in the created wo'-'d, 
and the meanness of others. But it ap- 
peal's, that, even upon this hypothesis, 
he would still be the author of them; 
besides, that to Omnipotence nothing is 
troublesome, nor those things mean, 
"when considered as part of a system, 
which alone might appear to be so.

POLYGAMY, the state of having 
more wives than one at once. Though 
this article, (like some others we have 
inserted,) cannot be considered as strict- 
ly theological, yet, as it is a subject of im- 
portance to society, we shall here in- 
troduce it. The circumstances of the 
patriarchs living in polygamy, and their 
not being reproved for it, has given occa- 
sion for some modern writers to suppose 
that it is not unlawful : but it is answer- 
ed that the equality in the number of 
males and females born into the world 
intimates the intention of God that one 
woman should be assigned to one man ; 
" for. (says Dr. Paley) if to one man 
be allowed an exclusive right to five or 
more women, four or more men must 
be deprived of the exclusive possession 
of any ; which could never be the order 
intended. This equality, indeed, is not 
quite exact. The number of male infants 
exceeds that of females in the propor- 
tion of 19 to 18, or thereabouts ; but 
this excess provides for the gi'eater 
consumption of males by war, seafaring, 
and other dangerous or unhealthy occu- 
pations. It seems also a significant in- 
dication of the divine will, that he at 
first created only one woman to one 
man. Had God mtended polygamy for 
the species, it is probable he would have 
begun with it ; especially as by giving 
to Adam more wives than one, the mul- 
tiplication of the human race would 
have proceeded with a quicker pro- 
gress. Polygamy Jiot only violates the 



constitution of »ature, and the appa- 
rent design of the Deity, but produces 
to the parties themselves, and to the 
public, the following bad effects: con- 
tests and jealousies amongst the wives 
of the same husband ; distracted affec- 
tions, or the loss of all affection in tlie 
husband himself; a voluptuousness in 
the rich which dissolves the vigour of 
their intellectual as well as active fa- 
culties, producing that indolence and 
imbecility, both of mind and body, 
which have long characterized the na- 
tions of the East ; the abasement of one 
half of the human species, who, in coun- 
tries where polygamy obtains, ai'e de- 
graded into instruments of physical 
pleasure to the other half ; neglect of 
children ; and the manifold and some- 
times unnatural mischiefs which arise 
from a scarcity of women. To compen= 
sate for these evils, polygamy does not 
offer a single advantage. In the article 
of population, which it has been thought 
to promote, the community gain nothinp; 
(nothing, I mean, .compared with a state 
in which marriage is nearly universal ;) 
for the question is not, whether one 
man will have more children by five ov 
more wives than by one ; but whether 
these five wives would not bear the 
same or a gi-eater number of children 
to five separate husbands. And as to 
the care of children when produced, 
and the sending of them into the world 
in situations in which they may be likely 
to form and bring up families of their 
own, upon which the increase and suc- 
cession of the human species in a great 
degree depend, this is less provided for 
and less practicable, where twenty or 
thirty children are to be supported by 
the attention and fortunes of one father, 
than if they were divided into five or six 
families, to each of which were assign- 
ed the industry and uilieritance of two 
parents. Whether simultaneous poly- 
gamy was permitted by the law of^Mo- 
ses, seems doubtful, Deut. xvii. 16, 
Deut. xxi. 15 ; but whether permitted 
or not, it was certainly practised by the 
Jewish patriarchs both before that law 
and under it. The permission, if therf 
were any, might be like that of divorce, 
"for the hardness of their heart," in 
condescension to their established in- 
dulgences, rather than from the general 
rectitude or propriety of the thing itself. 
The state of manners in Judea had 
probably undergone a reformation in this 
respect before the time of Christ; for. 
in the New Testament we meet witli 
no trace or mention of anv such prac- 
tice being tolerated. For which reason, 
and because it was likewise forbidden

amongst the Greeks #iiid Romans, wc 
cannot e^xpect to find any express law 
upon the subject in the Christian code. 
1 he words of Christ, Matt. xix. 9. may 
be construed by an easy implication to 
prohibit polygamy; for if "whoever 
putteth away his wife, and marrieth an- 
other, committeth adultery;" he who 
marrieth another tozMowZ putting away 
the first is no less guilty of adultery ; 
because the adultery does not consist in 
the repudiation of the first Avife (for 
however unjust or cruel that may be, it 
is not adultery,) but entering into a se- 
cond marriage during the legal existence 
and obligation of the first. The several 
passages in St. Paul's writings which 
speak of marriage, always suppose 
it to signify the union of one man 
with one woman, Rom. vii. 2, 3. 1 Cor. 
vii. 12, 14, 16. The manners of different 
countries have varied in nothing more 
than in their domestic constitutions. 
Less polished and more luxurious na- 
tions have either not perceived the bad 
effects of polygamy, or, if they did per- 
ceive them, they who in such countries 
possessed the power of refoi-ming the 
laws, have been unwilling to resign their 
oivn gratifications. Polygamy is retain- 
ed at this day among the Turks, and 
throughout every part of Asia in which 
Christianity is not professed. In Chris- 
tian countries it is universally prohi- 
bited. In Sweden it is pimished with 
death. In England, besides the nullity 
of the second marriage, it subjects the 
offender to ti'ansportation or imprison- 
ment and branding for the first offence, 
and to capital punishment for the se- 
cond. And whatever may be said in 
behalf of polygamy, when it is authorized 
by the law of the land, the marriage of 
a secorid wife, during the life- time of the 
first, in countries where such a second 
marriage is void, must be ranked with 
the most dangerous and cruel of those 
frauds by which a woman is cheated 
out of her fortune, her person, and her 
happiness." Thus far Dr. Paley. We 
shall close this article with tl\e words of 
an excellent writer on the same side of 
the subject. 

"When we reflect," says he, "that 
the primitive institution of marriage li- 
mited it to one man and one woman; 
that this institution was adhered to 
by Noah and his sons, amidst tlie de- 
generacy of the age in which they lived, 
and in spite of the examples of polyga- 
my which the accursed race of Cain had 
introduced ; when we consider how 
very few (comparatively speaking) the 
examples of this practice were among 
the faithful ; how much it brought its 



own punishment with it ; and how du- 
bious and equivocal those passages are 
in which it appears to have the sanction 
of the divine approbation; when to these 
reflections we add another, respecting 
the limited views and temporary nature 
of the more ancient dispensations and in- 
stitutions of religion — how often the im- 
perfections and even vices of the patri- 
archs and people of God in old times are 
recorded, without any express notifica- 
tion of their criminality — how much is 
said to be commanded, which our re- 
verence for the holiness of God and his 
law will only suffer us to suppose were 
for wise ends permitted; how frequent- 
ly the messengers of God ad^apted them- 
selves to the genius of the people to 
whom they were sent, and the circum- 
stances of the times in which they lived ; 
above all, when we consider the purity, 
equity, and benevolence of the Christian 
law, the explicit declaration of our 
Lord and his apostle Paul respecting 
the institution of marriage, its design 
and limitation; when we reflect, too, on 
the testimony of the most ancient fa- 
thers, who could not possibly be igno- 
rant of the general and common prac- 
tice of the apostolic church ; and, 
finally, when to these considerations we 
add those which are founded on justice 
to the female sex, and all the regula- 
tions of domestic economy and national 
policy, we must wholly condemn the 
revival of polygamy." Palei/'s Moral

POLYTHEISM, the doctrine of a 
plurality of gods, or *ia\isible powers 
superior to man. 

" That there exists beings, one or ma- 
ny, powerful above the liimi an race, is 
a proposition," sa)"^ loi-d Kaims, "uni- 
versally admitted as true in all ages 
and among all nations. I boldly call it 
universal, notwithstanding what is re- 
ported of some gross savages ; for re- 
ports that contradict what is acknow- 
ledged to be general among men, re- 
quire more able vouchers than a few 
illiterate voyagers. Among many sa- 
vage tribes there are no words but for 
objects of external sense: is it surprising 
that such people are incapable of ex- 
pressing their religious perceptions, or 
any perception of internal sense ? The 
conviction that men have of superior 
powers, in every country where there 
are words to express it, is so well vouch- 
ed, that, in fair reasoning, it ought to be 
taken for granted among the few tribes 
where language is deficient." The 
' same ingenious author shows, with great 
strength of reasoning, that the opera- 
tions of nature and the government of 
this world, which to us loudly proclaim 
the existence of a Deity, are not 'suffi- 
cient to account for the universal belief 
of superior beings among savage tribes. 
He is therefore of opinion that this uni- 
versality of conviction can spring only 
from the image of Deity stamped upon 
the mind of every human being, the ig- 
norant equal with the learned. This, 
he thinks, may be termed the sense of 
Deity. 

This sense of Deity, however, is ob-. 
jected to by others, who thus reason : 
All nations, except the Jews, were once 
polytheists and idolaters. . If, therefore, 
his lordship's hypothesis be admitted, 



cither the doctrine of polytheism must 
Ije true theology, or this instinct or sense 
is of such a nature as to have, at differ- 
ent periods of the world, misled all 
mankind. All savage tribes are at 
present polytheists and idolaters ; but 
among savages every instinct appears 
in greater purity and vigour than among 
people polished by arts and sciences; 
and instinct never mistakes its objects. 
The instinct or primary impression of 
nature which grves rise to self-love, af- 
fection between the sexes, &amp;c. has, in 
all nations and in every period of time, 
a precise and determinate object, which 
it inflexibly pursues. How, then, comes 
it to. pass that this particular instinct, 
which, if real, is surely of as much im- 
portance as any other, should have 
uniformly led those who had no other 
guide, to pursue improper objects, to 
fall into the grossest eiTOrs, and the 
most pernicious practices .-* 

For these and other reasons, which 
might easily be assigned, they suppose 
that the fii'st religious principles must 
have been derived from a source differ- 
ent as well from internal sense as from 
the deductions of reason ; from a source 
which the majority of mankind had 
early forgotten; and v^hich, when it 
was banished from their minds, left 
nothing behind it to prevent the very 
first principle of religion from being 
perverted by various accidents or 
causes ; or, in some extraordinary con- 
currence of circumstances, from bein^, 
perhaps, entirely obliterated. This 
soui-ce of religion every consistent theist 
must believe to be rex-elation. Reason 
could not have introduced savages to 
the knowledge of God, and we have just 
seen that a sense of Deity is clogged 
with insuperable difficulties. Yet it is 
undeniable that all mankind have be- 
lieved in superior invisible powers ; and, 
if reason and instinct be set aside, there 
remains no other origin of this universal 
belief than primeval revelation cor- 
rupted, indeed, as it passed from father 
to son in the course ot many generations. 
It is no slight sujiport to this doctrine, 
that, if there really be a Deity, it is 
highly presumable that he would reveal 
himself to the first men; creatures 
whom he had formed with faculties to 
adore and to worship him. To other 
animals the knowledge of the Deity is 
of no importance, to man it is ot the 
first importance. Were we totally ig- 
norant of a Deity, this world would ap- 
pear to us a mere chaos. Under the 
government of a wise and benevolent 
Deity, chance is excluded, and every 
event appears to be the result of es

tablished laws. Good men submit to 
whatever happens without repining, 
knowing that every event is ordered by 
Divine Providence: they submit with 
entire resignation ; and such resignation 
IS a sovereign balsam for every misfor- 
tune or evil in life. 

As to tlie circumstances which led to 
polytheism, it haS been observed, that 
taking it for granted that our original 
progenitors were instructed by their 
Creator in the truths of genuine theism, 
there is no room to doubt but that 
those truths would be conveyed pure 
from father to son as long as the race 
lived in one family, and were not spread 
over a large extent of country. If any 
credit is due to the records of antiquity, 
the primeval inhabitaiits of this globe 
lived to so great an age, that they must 
have increased to a very large number 
long before the death of the common 
parent, who ^vould of course, be the 
bond of union to the whole society ; and 
whose dictates, especially in what re- 
lated to the origin of his being, and the 
existence of his Creator, would be lis- 
iened to with the utmost respect by eve- 
ry individual of his numerous progeny. 
Many causes, however, would conspire 
to dissolve this family, after the death 
of its ancestor, into separate and inde- 
pendent triljes, of which some would be 
driven by violence, or would voluntarily 
■wander to a distance from the rest. 
From this dispersion great changes 
would take place in the opinions of 
some of the tribes respecting the object 
of their religious worship. A single fa- 
mily, or a small tribe, banished into a 
desert wildefnesss (such as the whole 
earth must then have been) would find 
employment for all their time in pro- 
viding the means of subsistence, and in 
defending themselves from beasts of 
prey. In .such circumstances they would 
nave little leisure for meditation ; and, 
being constantly conversant with objects 
of sense, they would gradually lose the 
power of meditating upon the spiritual 
nature of that Being by whom their an- 
cestors had taught them that all things 
were created. The first wandei'ers 
would, no doubt, retain in tolerable pu- 
rity their original notions of Deity, and 
they would certainly endeavour to im- 

Eress those notions upon their children ; 
ut in circumstances infinitely more fa- 
&gt;'0urable to speculation than theirs could 
have been, the human mind dwells not 
long upon notions purely intellectual. 
We are so accustomed to sensible ob- 
jects, and to the ideas of space, exten- 
sion, and figure, which they are per- 
petually impressing upon the imagina- 



tion, that we find it extremely difficult 
to conceive any being without assigning 
to him a form and a place. Hence bi- 
shop Law supposes that the earliest ge- 
nerations of men (even. those to whom 
he contends that frequent revelations 
were vouchsafed) may have been no 
better than Anthropomorfihit.es in their 
conceptions of the Divine Being. Be this 
as it may, it is easy to conceive that the 
members of the first colonies would 
quickly lose many of the arts and much 
of the science which perhaps prevailed 
in the parent state ; .and that, fatigued 
with tne contemplation of intellectual 
objects, they would relieve their over- 
strained faculties by attributing to the 
Deity a place of abode, if not a human 
form. To men totally illiterate, the 

glace fittest for the habitation of the 
leity would undoubtedly appear to be 
the sun, the most beautiful and glorious 
object of which they could form any 
idea ; an object from which they could 
not but be sensible that they received 
the benefit of light and heat, and which 
experience must soon have taught them 
to be in a great measure the source of 
vegetation. From looking upon the sun 
as the habitation of their God, they 
would soon proceed to consider it as his 
body. Experiencing the effects of 
power in the sun, they would naturally 
conceive that luminary to be animated 
as their bodies wei'e animated ; they 
would feel his influence when above the 
horizon ; they would see him moving 
from east to west ; they would consider 
him, when set, as gone to take his re- 
pose ; and those exertions and inter- 
missions of power being analogous to 
what they experienced in themselves, 
they would look upon the sun as a real 
animal. Thus would the Divinity ap- 
pear to their untutored minds to be a 
compound being like a man, partly cor- 
poreal and partly spiritual ; and as soon 
as they imbibed such notions, though 
perhaps not before, they may be pro- 
nounced to have been absolute idolaters. 
When men had once got into this trains 
their gods would multiply upon them 
with wonderful rapidity. The moon, 
the planets, the fixed stars, &amp;c. would 
become objects of veneration. Hence 
we find Moses cautioning the people of 
Israel against worshipping the hosts of 
heaven, Deut. iv. 19. Other objects, 
however, from which benefits were re^ 
ceived or dangers feared, would like- 
wise be deified; such as demons, de- 
parted heroes, &amp;c. See Idolatry. 

From these accounts given us by the 
best writers of antiquity, it seems that 
though the polytheists believed heaven, 



PON

POP 



earth, and hell, were all filled with di- 
vinities, yet there was One who was 
considered as supreme over all the rest, 
or, at most, that there were but two 
self-existent gods from whom they con- 
ceived all the other divinities to have 
descended in a manner analogous to 
human generation. It appears, how- 
ever, that the vulgar Pagans considered 
each divinity as supreme, and unac- 
countable within his own province, and 
therefore entitled to worship, which 
rested ultimately in himself. The phi- 
losophers, on the other hand, seem to 
have viewed the inferior gods as ac- 
countable for every part of their con- 
duct to him who was their sire and 
sovereign, and to have paid to them only 
that inferior kind of devotion which the 
church of Rome pays to departed saints. 
Tlie vulgar Pagans wei'e sunk, in the 
grossest ignorance, from which states- 
men, priests, and poets, exerted their 
utmost influence to keep them from 
emerging ; for it was a maxim, which, 
however absurd, was universally re- 
ceived, " that there were many things 
true in religion which it was not con- 
venient for the vulgar to know ; and 
some things, which, though false, it was 
expedient that they should believe." It 
was no wonder, therefore, that the vul- 
gar should be idolaters and polytheists. 
The philosophers, however, were still 
worse ; they were wholly " without ex- 
cuse, because that, wlien Uiey knew 
God, they glorified him not as God ; 
neither were thankful, but became vain 
in their imaginations, and their foolish 
heart was darkened. Professing them- 
selves wise, they became fools, and wor- 
shipped and served the creature more 
than the Creator, who is God, blessed 
for ever," Rom i. 20, 21, 22, 25. See

PONTIFF, or High Priest, a per- 
son who has the superintendence and 
direction of divine worship, as the of- 
fering of sacrifices and other religious 
solemnities. The Romans had a col- 
lege of pontiffs, and over these a sove- 
reign pontiff, instituted by Numa, whose 
function it was to prescribe the cere- 
monies each god was to be worshipped 
withal, compose the rituals, direct the 
vestals, and for a good while to per- 
form the business of augury, till, on 
some superstitious occasion, he was pro- 
hibited intermeddling therevnth, The 



Jews, too, had their pontiffs ; and among 
the Romanists the pope is styled the 
sovereign pontiff". 

PONTIFICATE, is used for the state 
or dignity of a pontiff, or high priest ; 
but more particularly, in modern wri- 
ters, for the reign of a pope. 

POPE, a name which comes from the 
Greek word narra and signifies Father. 
In the East, this appellation is given to 
all Christian priests ; and in the West, 
bishops were called by it in ancient 
times ; but now for many centuries it 
has been appropriated to the bishop of 
Rome, whom the Roman Catholics look 
upon as the common father of all Chris- 
tians. 

All in communion with the see of Rome 
unanimously hold that our Saviour Je- 
sus Christ constituted St. Peter the 
apostle chief pastor under himself, to 
watch over his whole flock here on 
earth, and to preserve the unity of it, 
giving him the power requisite for these 
ends. They also believe that our Sa- 
viour ordained that St. Peter should 
have successors, with the like charge 
and power to the end of time. Now, as 
St. Peter resided at Rome for many 
years, and suffered martyrdom there, 
they consider the bishops of Rome as 
his successors in the dignity and office 
of the universal pastor of the whole 
Catholic church. 

The cardinals have for several ages 
been the sole electors of the pope. 
These are seventy in number, when the 
sacred college, as it is called, is com- 
plete. Of these, six are cardinal bi- 
shops of the six suburbicarian churches ; 
fifty are cardinal priests, who have all 
titles from parish churches in Rome ; 
and fourteen are cardinal deacons, who 
have their titles from churches in Rome 
of less note, called diaconias, or deacon- 
ries. These cardinals are created by 
the pope when there happen to be va- 
cancies, and sometimes he names one or 
two only at a time ; but commonly he 
defers the promotion until there be ten 
or twelve vacancies, or more ; and 
then at every second such promotion, 
the emperor, the kings of Spain and 
France, and of Britain, when Catholic, 
are allowed to present one ea,ch, to be 
made cardinal, whom the pope always 
admits, if there be not some very great 
objection. These cardinals are com- 
monly promoted from among such cler- 
gymen as have borne offices in the Ro- 
man court ; some are assumed from re- 
ligious orders ; eminent ecclesiastics of 
other countries are likewise often ho- 
noured with this dignity. Sons of sove- 
reign princes have frequently been

members of the sacred college. Their 
distinctive dress is scarlet, to signify that 
they ougiit to be ready to shed their 
blood for the faith and church, when 
the defence and honour of eithei; re- 
quire it. They wear a scarlet cap and 
hat: the cap is given to them by the 
pope if they are at Rome, and is sent to 
them if they are absent ; but the hat is 
never given but by the pope's own hand. 
These cardinals form the pope's stand- 
ing council, or consistory, for tlie ma- 
nagement of the public affairs of church 
and state. They are divided into differ- 
ent congregations for the more easy 
despatcli of business ; and some of them 
have the principal oifices in the ponti- 
fical court ; as that of cardinal, vicar, 
penitentiary, chancellor, chamberlain, 
prefect of the signature of "justice, pre- 
fect of memorials, and secretary of 
state. They have the title given tliem 
of eminence and most eminent. 

On the demise of a pope his pontifical 
seal is immediately broken by the cham- 
berlain, and all public business is inter- 
rupted tliat can be delayed ; messengers 
ar-e despatched to all the Catholic sove- 
reigns to acquaint them of the event, that 
they may take what measures they 
tliink proper : and that the cardinals, in 
tlieir dominions, if any there be, may 
hasten to tlie future election, if they 
choose to attend ; whilst the whole at- 
tention of the sacred C9Uege is turned to 
the preservation of tranquillity in the 
city and state, and to the necessary pi'e- 
pai'ations for the future election. The 
cardinal chamberlain has during the va- 
cancy of the holy see, great authority ; 
}&gt;e coins money with his own arms on it, 
lodges in the pope's apartments, and is 
attended by the body guards. He, and 
the first cardinal Ijishop, the first cardi- 
nal priest, and the first cardinal dea- 
con, have, during that time, the govern- 
ment almost entirely in their hands. 
The body of the deceased pope is car- 
ried to St. Peter's, where funeral ser- 
vice is performed for him with great 
pomp for nine days, and the cardinals 
attend them every morning. In the 
mean time, all necessary preparations 
for the election are made ; and the 
place where they assemble for that. 
purpose,.'which is called the Conclave, 
is fitted up in that part of the Vatican 
palace, which is nearest to St. Peter's 
church, as this has long been thought 
the most convenient situation. Here 
are formed, by partitions of wood, a 
number of cells, or chambers, equal to 
the number of cardinals, with a small 
distance between every two, and a broad 
gallery before them. A number is put 



on every cell, and small papers, with 
corresponding numbers, are put into a 
box ; every cardinal, or some one for 
him, draws out one of these papers, 
wiiich determines in what cell he is to 
lodge. The cells are lined with cloth ; 
and there is a part of each one separated 
for the conclavists, or attendants, of 
whom two are allowed to each cardi- 
nal, and three to cardinal princes. They 
are persons of some rank, and generally 
of great confidence ; but they must car- 
ry in their master's meals, serve him at 
table, and pei'form ail the offices of a 
menial servant. Two physicians, two 
surgeons, an apothecaiy, and some 
otlier necessary officers, are chosen fqr 
the conclave by the cai'dinals. 

On the tenth day after the pope's 
death, the cardinals who are then at 
Rome, and in a competent state of 
health, meet in the chapel of St. Peter's, 
which is called the Gregorian chapel, 
where a sermon on the choice of a pope 
is preached to them, and mass is said 
for invoking the grace of the Holy 
Ghost. Then the cardinals proceed to 
the conclave in procession, two by two, 
and take up their abode. When- all is 
properly settled, the conclave is shut 
up, having bozed wheels, or places of 
communication, in convenient quarters ; 
there are, also, strong guards placed 
all around. When any foreign cardinal 
arrives after the inclosure, the conclave 
is opened |pr his admission. In the be- 
ginning ewry cardinal signs a paper, 
containing an obligation, that, if he shall 
be raised to the papal chair, he will not 
alienate any part of the pontifical do- 
minion ; that he will not be prodigal to 
his relations ; and any other such stipu- 
lations as may liave been settled in for- 
mer times, or framed for that occasion. 

We now come to the election itself; 
and that this may be effectual, two- 
thirds of the cardinals present must 
vote for the same person. As this is 
often not easily obtained, they some- 
times remain whole months in the con-: 
clave. They meet in the chapel twice 
every day lor. giving their votes ; and 
the election may be effectuated by scru- 
tiny, accession, or acclamation. Scrutiny 
is the ordinary method, and consists in 
this : every cardinal writes his own 
name on the inner part of a piece of 
paper, and this is folded up and sealed ; 
on the second fold of the same paper, a 
conclavist writes the name of theper- 
son for whom his master votes. This, 
according to agreements observed for 
some centuries, must be one of the sa- 
cred college. On the outer side of the 
paper is written a sentence at random, 



POP 



463 



POP 



^vhich the votei* must well remember. 
Every cai'dinal, on entering into the 
chapel, goes to the altar, and puts his 
paper into a large chalice. 

When ail are convened, two cardinals 
number the votes ; and if there be more 
gr less than the number of cardinals 
present, the voting must be repeated. 
When this is not the case, the cai-dinal 
api)ointed for the purpose, reads the 
outer sentence, and the name of the 
cardinal under it ; so that each voter, 
hearing his own sentence, and the name 
joined with it, knows that there is no 
mistake. The names of all the cardi- 
nals .that are voted for are taken down 
in writing, with the number of votes for 
each ; and when it appears that any one 
has two-thirds of the number present in 

. his favour, the election is over ; but 
when this does not happen, the voting 
papers are all immediately burnt, with- 
out opening up the inner part. When 
several trials of coming to a conclusion 
by this method of sn'utiny have been 
made in vain, recourse is sometimes 
had to what is called accession. By it, 
when a cardinal perceives that when 
one or very few votes are wanting to 
any one for whom he has not voted at 
that time, he must say that he accedes 
to the one who has near the number of 
votes requisite ; and" if his one vote suf- 
fices to make up the two-thirds, or if he 
is followed by a sufTicient number of 
acceders, or new voters, for the said 
cardinal, the election is accomplished : — 
Lastly, a pope is sometimes elected by 
acclamation; and that is, when a cardi- 
nal being pretty sure that he will be 
joined by a number sufficient, cries out 
in the open chapel, that such a one 
shall be pope. If he is properly sup- 
ported, the election becomes unanimous ; 
those who would, perhaps, oppose it, 
foreseeing that their opposition would 
be fruitless, a:nd rather hurtful to them- 
selves. W^hen a pope is chosen in any 
of the three above-mentioned ways, the 
election is immediately announced from 
the balcony in the front of St. Peter's, 
homage is paid to the new pontiff, and 
couriers are sent oflF with the news to 
all parts of Christendom. The pope 
appoints a day for his coronation at St. 
Peter's, and for his taking possession of 

■ the patriarchal church ot St. John La- 
teran ; all which is performed with 
great solemnity. He is addressed by 
the expression of holiness, and most ho- 
ly father. 

The Roman Catholics beheve that the 
bishop of Rome is, under Christ, su- 
preme pastor of the whole church, and 
as such is not only the first bishop in or- 



der and dignity, but has also a power 
and jurisdiction over all Christians, in 
order to preserve unity and purity of 
faith and moral doctrine, and to main- 
tain order and regularity in all churches. 
See Supremacy. Some Catholic di- 
vines are of opinion that the pope can- 
not err when he addresses himself toe// 
the faithful on matters of doctrine. They 
well know that, as a private doctor, he 
may fall into mistakes as well as any 
other man ; but they think that, when 
he teaches the whole church. Provi- 
dence must presenc him from error. 
We have, however, already examined 
this sentiment under the article Infal- 
libility, to which the reader may re- 
fer. 

The see of Rome, aA:ording to Ro- 
man Catholics, is the centre of catholic 
unity. All their bishops communicate 
with the pope, and by his meaos with 
one another, and so form one body. 
However distant their churches may 
be, they all meet at Rome either in 
person or by their delegates, or at least 
by their letters. And, according to the 
discipline of the latter ages, though they 
are presented to the pope for their of- 
fice from their respective countries, yet 
from him they must receive their bulls 
of consecration before they can take 
possession of their sees. See Poprry. 

POPERY comprehends the religious 
doctrines and practices adopted and 
maintained by the church of Rome. 
The following summary, extracted 
chiefly from the decrees of the council 
of Trentj continued under Paul III. 
Julius III. and Pius IV. fi-om the year 
1545 to 1563, by successive sessions, and 
the creed of Pope Pius IV. subjoined to 
it, and bearing date November 1564, 
may not be unacceptable to the reader. 
One of the fundamental tenets strenu- 
ously maintained by popisli writers, is, 
the infallibility of the church of Rome ; 
though they are not agreed whether this 
privilege belongs to the pope or a ge- 
neral council, or to both united ; but 
they pretend that an infallible living 
judge is absolutely necessary to deter- 
mine controversies, and to secure peace 
in the christian church. However, Pro- 
testants allege, that the claim of infal- 
libility in any church is not justified by 
tire authority of Scripture, much less 
does it pertain to the church of Rome ; 
and that it is inconsistent with the na- 
ture of religion, and the personal obli- 
gations of its professors; and that it 
has proved ineffectual to the end for 
which it is supposed to be granted, since 
popes and councils have disagreed in ' 
matters of importance, and they havt 



POP 



4G4 



POP 



been incapable, with the advantage of 
this pretended infallibility, of maintain- 
ing union and peace. 

Another essential article of the popish 
creed is tlie supremacy of the pope, or 
his sovereign power over the universal 
church. See Supremacy. 

Farther ; the doctrine of the seven 
sacraments is apeculiar and distinguish- 
ing doctrine of the church of Rome ; 
these are baptism, confirmation, the 
eucharist, penance, extreme unction, 
orders, and matrimony. 

The council of Trent (sess. 7. can. 1.) 
pronounces an anathema on those who 
say that the sacraments are more or 
fewer than seven, or that any one of the 
above number is not truly and properly 
a sacrament. Afid yet it does not appear 
that they amounted to this number be- 
fore the twelfth century, when Hugo de 
St. Victore and Peter Lombard, about 
the year 1144, taught that there were 
seven sacraments. The council of Flo- 
rence, held in 1438, was the first coun- 
cil that determined this number. These 
sacraments confer grace, according to 
the decree of the council of Trent, 
(sess. 7. can. 8.) ex ofiere o/ierato, by 
the mere administration of them : three 
of them, viz. baptism, confirmation, and 
orders, are said (c. 9.) to impress an in- 
delible character, so that they cannot be 
repeated without sacrilege ; and the 
eificacy of every sacrament depends on 
the intention of the priest by whom it is 
administered, (can. 11.) Pope Pius ex- 
pressly enjoins that all these sacraments 
should be administered according to the 
received and approved rites of the 
Catholic church. With regard to the 
eucharist, in particular, we may here 
observe, that the church of Rome holds 
the doctrine of transubstantiation ; the 
necessity of paying divine worship to 
Christ under the form of the consecrated 
bread or host ; the propitiatory sacri- 
fice of the mass, according to their ideas 
of which, Christ is truly and properly 
offered as a sacrifice as often as the 
priest says mass ; it practises, likewise, 
solitary mass, in which the priest alone, 
who consecrates, communicates, and al- 
lows communion only in one kind, viz. 
the bread of the laity. Sess. 14. 

The doctrine of merits is another dis- 
fuiguishing tenet of poperj- ; with regard 
to which the council of Trent has ex- 
pi'essly decreed (sess. 6. can. 32.) that 
the good works ot justified persons are 
truly meritorious; deserving not only 
an increase of grace, but eternal life and 
an increase of glory; and it has ana- 
thematized all who deny this doctrine. 
Of the same kind is the doctrine of sa- 



tisfactions; which supposes that pem- 
tents may truly satisf}-, by the afflictions 
they endure under the dispensations of 
Providence, or. by voluntary penances 
to which they submit, for the temporal 
penalties of sin to which they are sub- 
ject, even after the remission of theiy 
eternal punishment. Sess. 6. can. 30. 
and sess. 14. can. 3 and 9. In tliis con- 
nection we may mention the popish dis- 
tinction of venial and mortal sins: the 
greatest evils arising from the former, 
are the temporaty pains of purgatory; 
but no man, it is said, can obtain the 
pardon of the latter, without confessing 
to a priest, and performing the penances 
which he imposes. 

The council of Trent (sess. 14. can. 
1.) has expressly decreed, that every 
one is accursed who shall affirm that 
penance is not truly and properly a sa- 
crament instituted by Christ in tlie uni- 
A'ersal church, for reconciling those 
Christians to the Divine Majesty, who 
have fallen into sin after baptism ; and 
this sacrament, it is declared, consists of 
two parts, the matter and the form : the 
matter is the act of the penitent, in- 
cluding contrition, confession, and satis- 
faction ; the form of it is the act of ab- 
solution on the part of the priest. Ac- 
cordingly it is enjoined, that it is the 
duty of every man who hath fallen af- 
ter baptism, to confess his sins once a 
year, at least, to a priest; that this 
confession is to be secret; for public 
confession is neither commanded nor 
expedient : and that it must be exact 
and particular, including; every kind and 
act of sin, with all the circumstances at- 
tending it. When the penitent has so 
done, the priest pronounces an absolu- 
tion, which is not conditional or declara- 
tive only, but absolute and judicial. This 
secret or auricular confession was first 
decreed and established in the fourth 
council of Lateran, under Innocent III. 
in 1215. (cap. 21.) And the decree of 
this council was afterwards confirmed 
and enlarged in the council of Florence 
and in that of Trent, which ordains, that 
confession was instituted by Christ ; that 
by the law of God it is necessary to sal- 
vation, and that it has always been prac- 
tised in the Christian church. As for 
the penances imposed on the penitent 
by way of satisfaction, they have been ' 
commonlv the repetition of certain forms 
of devotion, as paternosters, or ave 
marias, the payment of stipulated sums, 
pilgrimages, fasts, or various species of 
corporal discipline. But the most for- 
midable penance, in the estimation of 
many who have belonged to the Roman 
communion, has been the temporary

pains of pur§;atory. But under all the 
penalties which are inflicted or threat- 
ened in the Romish chui-ch, it has pro- 
vided relief by its indulgences, and by 
its prayers or masses for the dead, per- 
formed professedly for relieving and 
rescuing the souls that are detained in 
purgatory. 

Another article that has been long 
authoritatively enjoined and observed in 
the church of Rome, is the celibacy of 
her clergy. This was first enjoined at 
Rome by Gregory V'll. about the year 
1074, and established in England by 
Anselm, archbishop of - Canterbury, 
about the year 1175 ; though his prede- 
cessor Lanfranc had imposed it upon 
the prebendaries and clergy that lived 
in towns. And though the council of 
Trent was repeatedly petitioned by se- 
veral princes and states to abolish this 
restraint, the obligation of celibacy was 
rather established than relaxed by this 
council ; for they decreed, that mar- 
riage contracted after a vow of conti- 
nence, is neither lawful nor valid ; and 
thus deprived the church of the possi- 
bility of ever restoring marriage to the 
clergy. For if marriage, after a vow, 
be in itself unlawful, the greatest au- 
thority upon earth cannot dispense with 
it, nor permit marriage to the clergy 
who have already vowed continence. 
See Celibacy. 

To the doctrines and practices above 
recited, may be farther added, the wor- 
ship of images, of which Protestants ac- 
cuse the Papists. But to this accusation 
the Papist replies, that he keeps images 
by him to preserve in his mind the me- 
mory of the persons represented by 
them ; as people are wont to prej^erve 
the memory of their deceased f)-iends 
by keeping their pictures. He is taught 
(he says) to use them so as to cast his eyes 
upon the pictures or images, and thence 
to raise his heart to the things repre- 
sented ; and there to employ it in medi- 
tation, love, and thanksgiving, desire of 
imitation, &amp;c. as the object requires. 

These pictures or images have this 
advantage, that they inform the mind 
by one glance of wliat in reading might 
require a whole chapter : there being no 
other difference between them than that 
reading represents leisurely, and by de- 
grees, and a picture all at once. Hence 
he finds a convenience in saying his 
pravers with some devout pictures be- 
fore him, he being no sooner distracted, 
but the sight of these recalls his wan- 
dering thoughts to the right object ; and 
as certainly brings something good into 
his mind, as an immodest picture dis- 
turbs his heart with filthy thoughts. 



And because he is sensible that these 
holy pictures and images repi'esent and 
bring to his mind such objects as in his 
heart he loves, honours, and venerates, 
he cannot but upon that account love, 
honour, and respect the images them- 
selves. 

The council of Trent likewise de- 
creed, that all bishops and pastors who 
have the care of souls, do diligently in- 
struct their flocks that it is good and 
profitable to desire the intercession of 
saints reigiiing With Christ in heaven. 
And this decree the Papists endeavour 
to defend by the following observations : 
They confess that we have but one me- 
diator of redemption : but affirm that it 
is acceptable to God that we should 
have many mediators of intercession. 
Moses (say they) was such a mediator 
for the Israelites ; Job for his three 
fi'iends ; Stephen for his persecutors. 
The Romans were thus desired by St. 
Paul to be his mediators ; so were the 
Corinthians ; so the Ephesians {E/i. 
ad. Rom. Cor. Eph.) so almost every 
sick man desires the congregation to be 
his mediators, by remembering him iu 
their prayers. And so tlie Papist de- 
sires the blessed in heaven to be his me- 
diators: that is, that they would pray 
to God for him. But between these 
living and dead mediators there is no 
similarity : the livuig mediator is pre- 
sent, and certainly hears the request of 
those who desii-e him to intercede foi' 
them ; the dead mediator is as certainly 
absent, and cannot possibly hear the re- 
quests of all those who at the same in- 
stant may be begging him to intercede 
for them, unless he be possessed of the 
divine attribute of omnipresence ; and 
he who gives that attribute to any crea- 
ture, is unquestionably giiilty of idolatrj'. 
And as this deci-ee is contrary to one of 
the first principles of natural religion, 
so does it recei\ e no countenance from 
Scripture, or any Christian wi-iter of 
the three first centuries. Other prac- 
tices peculiar to the Papists are, the re- 
ligious honour and respect that they 
pay to saci-ed relics : by which they un- 
derstand not only the bodies and parts 
of the bodies of the saints, but any of 
those things that appertained to them, 
and which they touched ; and the ce- 
lebration of divine service in an un- 
known tongue : to which purpose the 
council of Trent hath denounced an 
anathema on any one who shall say that 
mass ought to be celebrated only m the 
vulgar tongue. (Sess. 25, and sess. 22, 
can. 9.) l^hough the council of Late- 
ran, under Innocent III. in 1213 (can. 
9.) had expressly decreed, that, be-

cause, in inany parts within the same 
city and diocese, there are many peo- 
ple of different manners and rites mix- 
ed together, but of one faith, the bishops 
of such cities or dioceses should provide 
fit men for celebrating divine offices, 
according to the diversity of tongues 
and rites, and for administering the sa- 
craments. 

We shall only add, that the church of 
Rome maintains, that unwritten tradi- 
tions ought to be added to the Holy 
Scriptures, in order to supply their de- 
fect, and to be regarded as of equal au- 
thority ; that the books of the Apocry- 
pha are canonical Scripture ; that the 
Vulgate edition of the Bible is to be 
deemed authentic ; and that the Scx-ip- 
tures are to be received and interpreted 
according to that sense which the holy 
mother church, to whom it belongs to 
judge of the true sense, hath held, and 
doth hold, and according to the unani- 
mous consent of the fathers. 

Such are the principal and distin- 
guishing doctrines of popery, most of 
which have received the sanction of the 
council of Trent, and that of the creed 
of pope Pius IV. which is received, pro- 
fessed, and sworn to, by every one who 
enters into holy orders in the church of 
Rome ; and at the close of this creed, 
■we are told, that the faith contained in 
it is so absolutely and indispensably ne- 
cessary, that no man can be saved with- 
out it. See Antichhist; Bowers's

POVERTY is that state or situation, 
opposed to riches, in which we are de- 
prived of the conveniences of life. In- 
digence is a degree lower, where we 
want the necessaries, and is opposed to 
superfluity. Want seems rather to ar- 
rive oy accident, implies a scarcity of 
provision rather than a lack of money, 
and is opposed to abundance. N'eed 
and necessity relate less to the situation 
of life than the other three words, but 
more to the relief we expect, or the re- 
medy we seek ; with this difference be- 
tween the two, that need seems less 
pressing than necessity. — 2. Poverty of 



tnind is a state of ignorance, or a mind 
void of religious principle. Rev. iii. 17. 
— 3. Poverty of spirit, consists in an in- 
ward sense ana feeling of our wants and 
defects; a conviction of our wretched 
and forlorn condition by nature ; with a 
dependence on divine grace and mercy 
for pardon and acceptance, Mat. v. 3. It 
must be distinguished from a poor spi- 
ritedncss, a sneaking fearfulness, which 
bringeth a snai'e. It is the effect of the 
operation of the Divine Spirit on the 
heart, John xvi. 8. ; is attended with 
submission to the divine will ; content- 
ment in our situation ; meekness and 
forbearance as to others, and genuine 
humility as to ourselves. It is a spirit 
approved of by Ciod, Isa. Ixvi. 2. evi- 
dential of true religion, Luke, xviii. 13. 
and terminates in endless felicity. Matt. 
v. 3. Isa. Ivii. 15. Ps. xxxiv. 18. Dun-

^ POWERS OF THE MIND are 

those faculties by which we think, rea- 
son, judge, &amp;c. " They are so various,"' 
says Dr. Reid, " so many, so connected, 
and complicated in most of their ope- 
rations, that there never has been anj^ 
division of them proposed which is not 
liable to considerable objections. The 
most common division is that of under- 
standing and will. Under the will we 
comprehend our active powers, and all 
that lead to action, or influence the 
mind to act ; such as appetites, pas- 
sions, affections. The understanding 
comprehends owY contemplative powersy 
by which we perceive objects; by which 
we conceive or remember them ; by 
which we analyze or compound them ; 
and by which we -iudge and reason 
concerning them. Or the intellectual 
powers are commonly divided into sim- 
ple apprehension, judgment, and rea- 
soning. See Reid on the Active Pow- 
ers, also on the Human Mind, and the 
Intellectual Powers ; Locke on the 
Understanding. For the influence 
Christianity has had on the moral and 
intellectual powers, see White's admi- 
rable Sermons, ser. 9.

person or action, with a commendation 
of the same. " The desire of pi-aise," 
says an elegant writer, " is generally- 
connected with all the finer sensibilities 
of human nature. It affords a ground 
on which exhortation, counsel, and re- 
proof, can work a proper effect. To 
be entirely destitute of this passion be- 
tokens an ignoble mind, on which no 
moi^al impression is easily made ; for 
where there is no desire of praise, there 
will also be no sense of reproach ; but 
while it is admitted to be a natural and 
in many respects an useful principle of 
action, we are to observe that it is en- 
titled to no more than our secondary 
regard. It has its boundary set, by 
transgressing which, it is at once trans- 
formed from an innocent into a most 
dangerous passion. When passing its 
natural line, it becomes the ruling spring 
of conduct ; when the regard which 
we pay to the opinionsof men encroaches 
on that reverence which we owe to the 
voice of conscience and the sense of du- 
ty ; the love of praise, having then gone 
out of its proper place, instead of im- 
proving, corrupts ; and instead of ele- 
vating, debases our nature." Young's

PRAISE OF GOD, the acknow- 
ledging his perfections, works, and be- 
nefits. Praise and thanksgiving are 
generally considered as synonymous, 
yet some distinguish them thus. Praise 
properly terminates in God, on account 
of his natural excellencies and perfec- 
tions, and is that act of devotion by 
which we confess and admire his se- 
veral attributes : but thanksgiving is a 
more contracted duty, and imports only 
a grateful sense and acknowledgment 
of past mercies.- We praise God for all 
his glorious acts of every kind, that re- 
gard either us or other men ; for his 
very vengeance, and those judgments 
which he sometimes sends abroad in 
the earth ; but we thank him, properly 
speaking, for the instances of his good- 
ness alone, and for such only of these 
as we ourselves are some way concern- 
ed in. See Thanksgiving; Bishop 
.4tterbury's Sermon on Psalm 1. 14 ; 
Sanrin's Sermons, vol. i. ser. 14; Tillot- 
son's Sermons, ser. 146. concl. 

PRAYER, a request or petition for 
mercies; or it is "an offering up our 
desires to God, for things agreeaole to 
his will, in the name of Christ, by the 
help of his Spirit, with confession of our 
sins, and thankful acknowledgment of 



his mercies." Nothing can be moi-e 
rational or consistent than the exercise 
of this duty. It is a divine injunction 
that men should always pray, and not 
faint, Luke, xviii. 1. It is highly proper 
we should acknowledge the obligations 
we are under to the Divine Being, and 
supplicate his throne for the blessings 
we stand in need of. It is essential to 
our peace and felicity, and is the happy 
mean of our cairying on and enjoying 
fellowship with God.- It has an influ- 
ence on our tempers and conduct, and 
evidences our subjection and obedience 
to God. We shall here consider the 
object, nature, kinds, matter, manner, 
and forms of prayer, together with its 
efficac}', and the objections made 
against it. 

I. The object of prayer is God alone, 
through Jesus Christ, as the Mediator. 
All supplications, therefore, to saints or 
angels, are not only useless but blas- 
phemous. All worship of the creature, 
however exalted that creature is, is 
idolatry, and strictly prohibited in the 
sacred law of God. Nor are we to 
pray to the Trinity, as three distinct 
Gods ; for though the Father, Son, and 
Holy Ghost be addressed in various 
parts of the Scripture, 2 Cor. xiii. 14. 
2 Thess. ii. 16, 17, ytt never as three 
Gods, for that would lead us directly 
to the doctrine of polytheism': the more 
ordinary mode the Scriptuip points out, 
is, to address the Father through the 
Son, depending on the Spirit to help our 
infirmities, Eph. ii. 18. Rom. viii. 26. 

II. As to the iiature of this duty: it 
must be observed, that it does not con- 
sist in the elevation of the voice, the 
posture of the body, the use of a form, 
or the mere extemporary use of words, 
nor, properly speaking, in any thing of 
an exterior nature ; but simply the of- 
fering up of our desires to God, Matt. 
XV. 8. (See the definition above.) It 
has been generally divided into adora- 
tion, by which we express our sense of 
the goodness and greatness of God, 
Dan. iv. 34, 25 ; confessio7i, by which 
we acknowledge our unworthiness, 1 
John, i. 9 ; supplication, by which we 
pray for pardon, grace, or any blessing 
we want. Matt. vii. 7 ; intcrcessio7i, by 
which we pray tor others, James, v. 16 ; 
and thanksgiving.hy which we express 
our gratitude tci God, Pliil. iv. 6. I'o 
which some add invocation, a makins^ 
mention of one or more of the names oi 
God; pleading, arguing our case with 
God in an humble and fervent manner ; 
dedicatioji, or surrendering ourselves to 
God ; deprecation, by which we desire 
that evils may be averted ; blessing, if- 



PRA 



46S 



PRA 



which we express our joy in God, and 
grat'tude for his mercies : but, as all 
these appear to me to be included in 
the fii-st five parts of prayer, I think 
they need not be insisted on. 

III. The different kinds of prayer, 
are, 1. Ejaculatory, by which the mind 
is directed to God on any emergency. 
It is derived from the word ejaculor, to 
dart or shoot out suddenly, and is there- 
fore appropriate to describe this kind of 
praver, which is made up of short sen- 
tences spontaneously springing from 
the mind. The Scriptures afford us 
many instances of ejaculatory prayer, 
Exod. xiv. 15. 1 Sam. i. 13. Rom. vii. 
24, 25. Gen. xliii. 29. Judges, xvi. 28. 
Luke, xxiii. 42, 43. It is one of the 
principal excellencies of this kind of 
prayer, that it can be practised at all 
limes, and in all places; in the public 
ordinances of religion ; in all our ordi- 
nary and extraordinary undertakings ; 
in times of affliction, temptation, and 
danger ; in seasons of social intercourse, 
in worldly business, in travelling, hi 
sickness, and pain. In fact, every thing 
around us, and every event that trans- 
pires, may afford us matter for ejacula- 
tion. It is worthy, therefore, of our 
practice, especially when we consider 
that it is a species of devotion that can 
receive n(j impediment from any exter- 
nal circumstances ; that it has a ten- 
dency to s#pport the mind, and keep it 
in a liappy fi'ame ; fortifies us against 
the temptations of the world ; elevates 
our affections to God ; directs the mind 
into a spiritual channel ; and has a ten- 
dency to excite trust and dependence 
on Divine Providence. — 2. Secret or 
closet prayer is another kind of prayer 
to which we should' attend. It has its 
name from the manner in which Christ 
)ecommended it. Matt. vi. 6. He him- 
self set us an example of it, Luke, vi. 
12 ; and it has been the practice of the 
saints in every age. Gen. xxviii. xxxii. 
Dan. vi. 10. Acts, x. 9. There are 
some particular occasions when this 
duty may be pi-actised to advantage, as 
when we ai-e entering into any impor- 
tant situation ; undertaking any thing of 
consequence ; l:)efore we go into the 
world ; when calamities surround us, 
Isa. xxvi. 20 ; or when ease and pros- 
perity attend us. As closet prayer is 
calculated to inspire us with peace, de- 
fend us from our spiritual enemies, ex- 
cite us to obedience, and promote our 
i-eal happiness, we should be watchful 
lest the stupidity of our frame, the in- 
trusion of company, the cares of the 



from the constant exercise of this ne- 
cessary and important duty. — 3. Faynily 
prayer is also another part not to be 
neglected. It is true there is no abso- 
lute command for this in God's word; 
yet from hints, allusions, and examples, 
we may learn that it was the practice of 
our forefathers: Abraham, Gen. xviii. 
19. David, 2 Sam. vi. 20. Solomon, 
Prov. xxii. 6. Job, i. 4, 5. Joshua, xxiv. 
15. See also Eph. vi. 4. Prov. vi. 20. 
Jer. x. 25. Acts, x. 2, 30. Acts, xvi. 15. 
Family prayer, indeed, may not be es- 
sential to the character of a true Chris- 
tian, but it is surely no honour to heads 
of families to have it said that they have 
no religion in their houses. If we con- 
sider what a blessing it is likely to prove 
to our children and our domestics; what 
comfort it must afford to ourselves ; 
what utility it may prove to the com- 
munitv at large ; how it sanctifies do- 
mestic comforts and crosses ; and what 
a tendency it has to promote order, de- 
cency, sobriety, and religion in general, 
we must at once see the propriety of at- 
tending to it. The objection often made 
to family prayer is, want of time ; but 
this is a very frivolous excuse, shice the 
time allotted for this purpose need be 
but short, and may easily be redeemed 
from sleep or business. Others say, 
they have no gifts: where this is the 
case, a form may soon be jjrocured and 
used, but it should be remembered that 
gifts increase by exercise, and no man 
can properly decide, unless he make 
repeated trials. Others are deterred 
through shame, or the fear of man ; in 
answer to such we shall refer them to 
the declarations of our Lord, Matt. x. 
37, 38. Mark, viii. 38. As to the season 
for family prayer, every family must 
determine for itself ; but before break- 
fast every morning, and before supper 
at night, seems most proper: perhaps 
a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes 
may be sufficient as to the time. — 4. So- 
cial prayer is another kind Christians 
are called upon to attend to. It is de- 
nominated social, because it is offered 
by a society of Christians in their col- 
lectixe capacity, convened for that par- 
ticular purpose, either on some peculiar 
and extraordinary occasions, or at stated 
and regular seasons. Special prayer- 
meetings are such as are held at the 
meeting and parting of intimate friends, 
especially churches and ministers; 
when the church is in a state of unusual 
deadness and barrenness ; when mi- 
nisters are sick, or taken away by 
death ; in times of public calamity and 



world, the insinuations of Satan, or the | distress, &amp;c. Stated meetings for social 
indulgence of sensual objects, pi-evcnt us [| prayer are such as are held weekly in 



PRA 



469 



PRA 



some places which have a special I'e- 
gard to the state of the nation and 
churches : missionary prayer-meetings 
for the spread of the Gospel : weekly 
meetings held in most of the congrega- 
tions wliich have a more particular re- 
ference to their own churches, ministers, 
the sick, feeble, and weak of the flock. 
Christians are greatly encouraged to 
this kind of prayer from the considera- 
tion of the promise. Mutt, xviii. 20 ; the 
benefit of mutual supplications ; from 
the example of the most eminent pri- 
mitive saints, Mai. iii. 16. Acts, xii. 12 ; 
the answers given to prayer, Acts, xii. 
1 — 12. Josh. X. Isaiah, xxxvii. &amp;c. and 
the signal blessing they are to the 
churches, Phil. i. 19. 2 Cor. i. 11. These 
meetings should be attended with regu- 
larity ; those who engage should study 
simplicity, brevity, Scriptui-e language, 
seriousness of spirit, and every thing 
that has a tendency to edification. We 
now come, lastly, to take notice of 
fiublic firayer, or that in which the 
whole congregation is engaged, either in 
repeating a set form, or acquiescing 
with the prayer of the minister who 
leads their devotions. This is both an 
ancient and important part of religious 
exercise ; it was a part of the patri- 
archical worship. Gen. iv. 56 ; it was 
also carried on by the Jews, Exod. xxix. 
43. Luke, i. 10. It was a part of the 
temple service. Is. Ivi. 7. 1 Kings, viii. 
59. Jesus Christ recommended it both 
by his example and instruction. Matt. 
xviii. 20. Luke, iv. 16. The disciples 
also attended to it, Acts, ii. 41, 42 ; and 
the Scriptures in many places counte- 
nance it, Exod. XX. 24. rsal. Ixiii. 1, 2. 
Psal. Ixxxiv. ] 1. Psal, xxvii. 4. For the 
nature, necessity, place, time, and at- 
tendance on public worship, see Wor- 
ship. 

IV. Of the matter of prayer. "It is 
necessary," says Dr. Watts, " to fur- 
nish ourselves with proper matter, that 
we may be able to hold much converse 
with God ; to entertain ourselves and 
others agreeably and devoutly in wor- 
ship ; to assist the exercise of our own 
gi-ace and others, by a rich supply of di- 
vine thought and desires in prayer, that 
we may not be forced to make too long 
and indecent pauses whilst we are per- 
forming that duty ; nor break off abrupt- 
ly as soon as we have begun for want of 
matter ; nor pour out abundance of words 
to dress up narrow and scanty sense 
for want ot variety of devout thoughts. 
1. We should labour after a large ac- 
quaintance with all things that belong 
to religion ; for there is nothing that re- 
lates to rehgion but may projjerly make 



some part of the matter of our prayer. 
A great acquaintance with (iod in his 
nature, pei-lections, works and word ; 
an intimate acquaintance with ourselves, 
and a lively sense of our own frames, 
wants, soiTows, and joys, will supply us 
with abundant furniture. We should also 
be watchful observers of the dealings of 
God with us in e\eiy ordinance, and in 
every providence. vVe should observe 
the working of oui- heart towards God, 
or towards the creature, and often ex.- 
amine our temper and our life, botja in 
our natural, ovu* civil, and religious ac- 
tions. For this purpose, as well as 
upon many other accounts, it will be 
ot great advantage to keep by us in 
writing some of the most remarkable 
providences of God, and instances of 
his mercy or anger towards us, and 
some of our most remarkable cari'iages 
towards him, whether sins, or duties, or 
the exercises of gi-ace. — 2. We should 
not content ourselves merely with ge- 
nerals ; but if we wish to be furnished 
with larger supplies of matter, we must 
descend to particulars in our confessions, 
petitions, and thanksgivings. We sliould 
enter into a particular consideration of 
the attributes, the glories, the graces, 
and the relations of God. We should 
express our sins, our wants, and our 
sorrows, with a particular sense of the 
mournful circumstances that attend 
them : it will enlarge our hearts with 
prayer and humiliation if we confess the 
aggravations that increase the guilt of 
our sins, viz. whether they have been 
committed against knowledge, against 
the warnings of conscience, &amp;c. It will 
furnish us with large matter, if we run 
over the exalting and heightening cir- 
cumstances of our mercies and com- 
forts, viz. that they are great, and spi- 
ritual, and etei-nal, as well as temporal. 
Our petitions and thanksgivings, in a 
special manner, should be suited to the 
place and circumstances of ourselves, 
and those that we pray with, and those 
that we pray for. — 3. It is very proper, 
at solemn seasons of worship, to read 
some part of the word of God, or some 
spiritual treatise written by holy men ; 
or to converse with fellow Christians 
about divine things, or to spend some 
time in recollection or meditation of 
things that belong to religion : this will 
not only supply us with divine matter, 
but will compose our thoughts to a so- 
lemnity. Just before we engage in that 
work, we should be absent a little from 
the woi-ld, that our spirits mav Ije freer 
for converse with God. — 4. If we find 
our hearts, after all \'ery barren, and 
hardly knOw how to frame a prayer be- 



PRA 



470 



PRA 



fore God of ourselves, it has been of- 
tentimes useful to take a book in our 
hand, wherein are contained some spi- 
ritual meditations in a petitionary form, 
some devout reflections, or excellent 

fatterns of prayer ; and, above all, the 
salms of David, some of the prophe- 
cies of Isaiah, some chapters in the 
Gospels, or any of the Epistles. Thus 
we may lift' up our hearts to God in se- 
cret, according as the verses or para- 
graphs we read are suited to the case of 
out; own souls. This many Christians 
have experienced as a very agreeable 
help, and of great advantage in their 
secret retirement. — 5. We must not 
thiiik it absolutely necessary to insist 
upon all the parts of prayer in every 
address to God ; though in our stated 
and solemn pravers there are but few 
of them that caii be well left out. What, 
we omit at one time we may, perhaps, 
pursue at anotlier with more lively af- 
fection. But let us be sure to insist 
most upon those things which are 
warmest in our hearts, especially in 
secret. \\'e should let those parts of 
prayer have the largest share in the 

Eerformance for which our spirits is 
est prepared, whether it be adoi^ation, 
petition, confession, or thanksgiving. — 
6. We should suit the matter of our 
jiravers to the special occasion of eacli 
particular duty, to the circumstances of 
the time, place, and persons with and 
for whom we pray. This will direct us 
to the choice of "proper thoughts and 
language for every part of prayer. — 7. 
We should not affect to pray long for 
the sake of length, or to stretch out our 
matter by labour and toil of thought, be- 
yond the furniture of our own spirit. 
Sometimes a person is betrayed by an 
affectation of long prayers into crude, 
rash, and unseemly expressions ; we are 
tempted hereby to tautologies, to say 
the same thing over and over again. 
\¥e are in danger of tiring those that 
join with us. We exceed -the season 
that is allotted for us in prayer, espe- 
cially when others are to succeed in. the 
same work." 

V. Of the method of pf ay er. "Me- 
thod," continues Dr. Watts, " is ne- 
cessary to guide our thoughts, to regu- 
late our expressions, and dispose of the 
several parts of prayer in such an or- 
der, as is most easy to be understood by 
those that join with us, and most proper 
to excite and maintain our own devo- 
tion and theirs. Tliis will be of use to 
secure us from confusion, prevent repe- 
titions, and giiard us against roving di- 
gressions. The general rules of me- 
thod in prayer are these tliree : 1. Let 



the general and the particular heads in 
prayer be well distinguished, and usually 
let generals be mentioned first, andpar- 
ticulars follow. — 2. Let things oithe 
same kind, for the most part, be put to- 
gether in prayer. We should not run 
from one part to another by starts, and 
sudden wild thoughts, and then return 
often to the same part again, going 
backward and forward in confusion : 
this bewilders the mind of him that 
prays, disgusts our fellow-worshippers, 
and injures their devotion. — 3. Let 
those things, in every part of prayer, 
which are the proper objects of our 
judgment, be fii-st mentioned, and then 
those that influence and move our af- 
fections ; not that we should follow 
such a manner of prayer as is more like 
preaching, as some impnidently have 
done, speaking many divine truths with- 
out the form or air of prayer. Yet it 
must be granted that there is no ne- 
cessity of always confining ourselves to 
this, or to any other set method, no more 
than there is of confining ourselves to a 
form in prayer. Sometimes the mind 
is so divinely full of one particular part 
of prayer, that high expressions of 
gratitude, and of devoting ourselves to 
God, break out first. I am persuaded, 
however, that if young Christians did 
not give themselves up to a loose and 
negligent habit of speaking every thing 
that comes uppermost, but attempted to 
learn this holy skill by a recollection of 
the several parts of prayer, and pro- 
perly disposing their thoughts, there 
would be great numbers in our churches 
that would arrive at a good degree of 
the gift of prayer, and that to the great 
edification of our churches, as well as of 
their own families." 

As to expression in prayer, it may be 
observed, that tholigh prayer be the 
proper work of the heart, yet in this 
present state, in secret as well as in 
social prayer, the language of the lips is 
an excellent aid in this part of worship. 
Expressions are useful not only to dress 
our thoughts, but sometimes to form, 
and shape, and perfect the ideas and af- 
fections of our minds. They serve to 
awaken the holy passions of the soul as 
well as to express them. They fix 
and engage all our powers in religion 
and worship ; and they serve to regulate 
as well as to increase our devotion. 
The directions to attain a treasure of 
expressions are these : 1. We should la- 
bour after a fresh, pmrticular, and lively 
sense of the greatness and grace of 
God, and of our own wants, and sins, 
and mercies. The passions of the mind, 
when they are moved, do mightily help 



PRA 



471 



PRA 



the tongue; they give a natural elo- 
quence to those who know not any iniles 
of art, and they almost constrain the 
dumb to speak. There is a remarkable 
instance of this in ancient history. 
When Atys, the son of Croesus the 
king,, who was dumb from his child- 
hood, saw his father ready to be slain, 
the violence of his passion broke the 
bonds wherewith his tongue was tied, 
and he cried out to save him. Let our 
spiritual senses be always awake and 
lively, then words will follow in a great- 
er or less degree. — 2. We should trea- 
sure up such expressions, especially, as 
we read in Scripture, and such as we 
have found in other books of devotion, 
or such as we have heard fellow Chris- 
tians make use of, whereby our own 
hearts have been sensibly moved and 
warmed. — 3. We should be always rea- 
dy to engage in holy conference, and 
divine discourse. This will teach us to 
speak of the things of God. It should 
be our practice to recollect and talk 
over with one another the sermons we 
have heard, the books of divinity we 
have been conversant with, those parts 
of the word of God we have lately 
read, and especially our own expe- 
riences of divine things. Hereby we 
shall gain a large treasure of language 
to clothe our thoughts and affections. — 
4. We should pray for the gift of utter- 
ance, and seek the blessing of the Spirit 
of God upon the use of proper means 
to obtain a treasure of expressions for 
prayer; for the wise man tells us, that 
" the preparation of the heart in man, 
and the answer of the tongue, is from 
the Lord," Prov. xvi. 1. The rules 
about the choice and use of firoper ex- 
pressions are tliese : 1. We should 
ciioose those expressions that best suit 
our meaning, that most exactly answer 
the ideas of our mind, and that are fitted 
to our sense and apprehension of things. 
— ^2. We should use such a way of speak- 
ing as may be most natural and easy to 
be understood, and most agi'eeable to 
those that join with us. We should 
avoid all foreign and uncommon words ; 
all those expressions which are too phi- 
losophical, and those which savour too 
much of mystical divinity; all dark me- 
taphors, or expressions that are used 
only by some particular violent party- 
men. We should likewise avoid length 
and obscurity in our sentences, and in 
the placing of our words ; and not in- 
terline our expressions with too many 
parentheses, which cloud and entangle 
the sense. — 3. Our language should be 
grave and decent, which is a medium 
Between magnificence and meanness ; 



we should avoid all glittering language 
and affected style. An excessive fond- 
ness of elegance and finery of style in 
prayer discovers the same pride and 
vanity of mind, as an affection to many 
jewels and fine apparel in the house of' 
God : it betrays us into a neglect of our 
hearts, and of experimental religion, by 
an affectation to make the nicest speech, 
and say the finest things we can, in- 
stead of sincere devotion, and praying 
in the spirit. On the other hand, we 
should avoid mf an and coarse, and too 
familiar expressions; such as excite 
any contemptible or ridiculous ideas; 
such as raise any improper or irreverent 
thouglits in the mind, or base and im- 
pure images, for these mucli injure the 
devotion of our fellow-worshippers. — 4. 
We should seek after those ways of ex- 
pression that are pathetical; such as 
denote the fervency of affection, and 
carry life and spirit with them; such as 
may awaken and exercise our love, our 
hope, our holy joy, our sorrow, our 
fear, and our faith, as well as express 
the activity of those graces. This is the 
way to raise, assist, and maintain devo- 
tion. We should, therefore, avoid such 
a sort of style as looks more likep reach- 
ing, which some persons that affect long 
prayers have been guilty of to a great 
degree : they have been speaking to 
the people rather than speaking to God ; 
they have wandered away from God to 
speak to men; but this is q^uite contrary 
to the nature of prayer, tor prayer is 
our own address to God, and pouring 
out our hearts before him with warm 
and proper affections. — 5. We should 
not always confine ourselves to one set 
form of words to express any particular 
request; nor take too much pains to 
avoid an expression merely because we 
used it in prayer heretofore. W^e need 
not be over fond of a nice uniformity of 
words, nor of perpetual diversity of ex- 
pression in every prayer : it is best to 
keep the middle between these two ex- 
tremes. The imitation of those Chris- 
tians and ministers tliat have the best 
gifts, will be an excellent direction ui 
this as well as in the former cases. 

As to the -voice in prayer: in the first 
place, our words should be all pro- 
nounced distinct, and ought not to. be 
made shorter by cutting off the last syl- 
lable, nor longer by the addition of hems 
and o's, of long breaths, affected groan- 
ings, and useless sounds, &amp;c. — 2. Every 
sentence should be spoken loud enough 
to be heard, yet none so loud as to af- 
fright or offend the ear. Some persons 
have got a habit of beginning their 
prayers, and even upon the most com- 



PRA 



472 



PRA 



mon family occ;isions, so loud as to 
startle the companv ; others begin so 
low in a large assembly, that it looks 
like secret worship, and as though they 
forbid those that are present to join 
with them. Both these extremes are to 
be avoided by piiidence and moderation. 
— 3. "V\'e should observe a due medium 
between excessive swiftness and slow- 
ness of speech, for both are faulty in 
their kind. If we are too swift, our 
words will be hurried on, and be min- 
gled in confusion ; if ^^ are too slow, 
this will be tiresome to the hearers, and 
will make the worship appear heavy 
and dull. 

As to gesUire in prayer : all inde- 
cencies should be avoided. Prostration 
mav be sometimes used in secret prayer, 
under a deep and uncommon s-ense of 
sin ; but knee/ing is the most frequent 
posture ; and nature seems to dictate 
and lead us to it as an expression of hu- 
mility, of a sense of our wants, a sup- 
plication for mercy, and adoration of 
and dependence on him before whom 
we kneel. 

" Stanclinif is a posture not unfit for 
this worship, especially in places where 
we have not convcniency for the hum- 
bler gestures: but sittitig, or other pos- 
tures of rest and laziness, ought not to be 
indulged, unless persons are aged or in- 
firm, or the work of prayer be drawn 
out so long as to make it troublesome to 
human nature to maintain itself always 
in one posture The head should be 
kept for the most part without motion ; 
the whole visage should be composed to 
gravity and solemnity. The eye should 
be kept from roving, and some think it 
best to keep the eyes closed. The lift- 
ing u/i of the hands is a Aery natural 
expression of our seeking help from 
God. As to other parts of the body 
there is little need of direction. In se- 
cret devotion, sighs and groans may be 
allowed ; but in public these things 
should be less indulged. If we use our- 
selves to various motions, or noise made 
by the hands or feet, or any other 
parts, it will tempt others to think that 
our minds are not very intensely en- 
gaged ; or, at least, it will appear so fa- 
miliar and irreverent, as we would not 
willingly be guilty of in the presence of 
our superiors here on earth." 

\T. As to forms of f tray er. We find 
tliis has been a matter of controversy 
among divines and Christians, whether 
such ought to be used, or whether ex- 
tempore prayers are not to be pi-efer- 
red. We shall state the arguments on 
both sides. Tliose who are advocates 
for forms, observe, that it prevents ab- 



surd, extravagant, or impious addresses 
to Ciod, as well as the confusioji of ex- 
temporary prayer; that forms wei'e 
used under the Old Testament dispen- 
sation ; and, in proof thereof cite Numb, 
vi. 24, 26. Numb. x. .35, 36. On the 
other side it is answered, that it is nei- 
ther reasonable nor Scrijjtural to look 
for the pattei-n of Christian worship in 
the Mosaic dispensation, which, with all 
its rites and cei'emonies, is abrogated 
and done away ; that, though roi'ms 
may be of use to children, and such as 
are very ignorant, yet restriction to 
forms, either in public or private, does 
not seem Scriptural or luMfid. If we 
look to the authority and example of 
Christ and his apostles, eveiy thing is 
in favour of extempore prayer. The 
Lord's prayer, it is obser\ ed, was not 
given to be a set form, exclusive of ex- 
temporary prayer. See Lord's Pr ay- 
KR. It is farther argued, that a form 
cramps the desires ; inverts the true 
order of prayer, making our words to 
regulate our desires, instead of our de- 
sires regulating our words ; has a ten- 
dency to make us formal ; cannot l&gt;e 
suited to every one's case ; that it looks 
as if we were not in reality convinced 
of our wants, when we want a form to 
express them ; and, finallv, in answer 
to the two first arguments, that it is 
seldom tlie case that those who are 
ti-uly sensible of their condition, and 
pray extempore, do it in an impious and 
extravagant manner ; and if any who 
have the gift of prayer really do so, and 
ran into the extreme of enthusiasm, yet 
this is not the case with the generality, 
since an unprejudiced attention to those 
who pray extempore must convince us, 
that, if their prayers be not so elegantly 
composed as that of a set form, they are 
more appropriate, and delivered with 
more energy and feeling. 

VII. The efficacy of prayer. It has 
been objected, that, "if what we re- 
quest be fit for us, we shall "have it 
without praying; if it be not fit for us, 
we cannot obtain it by pi-aying." But 
it is answered, that it may be agreeable 
to perfect wisdom to grant that to our 
pravers which it would not have been 
agreeable to the same wisdom to have 
given us. without ])raying for. But what 
virtue, you will ask, Is there in prayer, 
which should make a favour consistent 
with wisdom, wliich would not have 
been so without it.' To this question, 
which contains the whole difficulty at- 
tending the subject, the following possi- 
bilities are offered in reply : 1. A favour 
granted to praj'er, may be more apt on 
that very account to produce a good ef-

feet upon the person obliged. It may 
hold in the divine bounty, what expe- 
rience has raised into a proverb in the 
collation of human benefits, that what 
is obtained without asking, is oftentimes 
received without gratitude. — 2. It may 
be consistent with the wisdom of the 
Deity to withhold his favours till they 
be asked for, as an expedient to encou- 
rage devotion in his rational creation, in 
order thereby to keep up and circulate 
a knowledge and sense of their de- 
pendency on him. — 3. Prayer has a na- 
tural tendency to amend the petitioner 
liimself; it composes the mind, hum- 
bles us under a conviction of what we 
are, and under the gracious influence of 
the Divine Spirit assimilates us into 
the divine image. Let it suffice, there- 
fore, to say, that, though we are cer- 
tain that God cannot be operated on, or 
moved as a fellow-creature may ; that 
though we cannot inform him of any 
thing he does not know, nor add any 
thing to his essential and glorious per- 
fections, by any services of ours ; yet 
■we should remember that he has ap- 
pointed this as a mean to accomplish an 
end ; that he has commanded us to en- 
gage in this important duty, 1 Thess. v. 
17 ; that he has promised his Spirit to 
assist us in it, Rom. viii. 26 ; that the 
Bible abounds with numerous answers 
to prayer ; and that the promise still 
relates to all who pray, that answers 
shall be given, Matt. vii. 7. Psal. 1. 15.

PREACHER, one who discourses 
publicly on religious subjects. See ar- 
ticles Declamation, Eloquence, 
Minister, and Sermon. 

PREACHING is the discoursing 
publicly on any religious subject. It is 
impossible, in the compass of this work, 
to give a complete history of this ar- 
ticle from the beginning down to the 
present day. This must be considered 
as a desideratum in theological learning. 
Mr. Robinson, in his second volume of 
Claude's Essay, has prefixed a brief 
dissertation on this subject, an abridg- 
ment of which we shall here insert, 
with a few occasional alterations. 

From the sacred records we learn, 
that, when men began to associate for 
the purpose of worshipping the Deity, 



Enoch prophesied, Jude, 14, 15. We 
have a very short account of this pro- 
phet and his doctrine ; enough, how- 
ever, to convince us that he taught the 
principal tiniths of natural and revealed 
religion. Conviction :of sin was in his 
doctrine, and communion with God was 
exemplified in his conduct. Gen. v. 24. 
Heb. xi. 5, 6. Fi-om the days of Enoch, 
to the time of Moses, each patriarch 
worshipped God with his family ; pro- 
bably several assembled at new moons, 
and alternately instructed the whole 
company. — Noah, it is said, was a 
preacher of righteousness, 2 Pet. ii. 5. 
1 Pet. iii. 19, 20. Abraham commanded 
his household after him to keep the 
way of the Lord, and to do justice and 
judgment. Gen. xviii. 19 ; and Jacob, 
when his house lapsed to idolatry, re- 
monstrated against it, and exhorted them 
and all that were with him to put away 
strange gods, and to go up with him to 
Bethel, Gen, x. Gen. xxv. 2, 3. Mel- 
chisedek, also we may consider as the 
father, the prince, and the priest of his 
people, publishing the glad tidings of 
peace and salvation. Gen. xviii. Heb. vii. 
Moses was a most eminent prophet 
and preacher, raised up by the authority 
of God, and by whom, it is said, came 
the law,lo\v[\,\. 17. This great man had 
much at heart the promulgation of his 
doctrine ; he directed it to be inscribed 
on pillars, to be transcribed in books, 
and to be taught both in public and pri- 
vate by word of mouth. Dent, xxviii. 8. 
Dcut. vi. 9. Deut. xxxi. 19. Deut. xvii. 
18. Numb. V. 23. Deut. iv. 9. Himself 
set the example of each ; and how he 
and Aaron sermonized, we may see by 
several parts of his writings. The first 
discourse was heard with profound re- 
verence and attention ; the last was 
both uttered and received in raptures, 
Ex. iv. 31. Deut. xxxiii. 7, 8. Public 
preaching does not appear under this 
oeconomy to have been attached to the 
priesthood : priests were not officially 
preachers ; and we have innumerable 
instances of discourses delivered in reli- 
gious assemblies by ^n^ of other tribes 
besides that of Levi, Ps. Ixviii. 11. 
Joshua was an Ephraimite; but being 
full of the spirit of wisdom, he gathered 
the tribes to Shechem, and harangued 
the people of God, Deut. xxxiv. 9. 
Joshua, xxxiv. Solomon was a prince 
of the house of Judah, Amos a herdsman 
of Tekoa; yet both were preachei-s, 
and one at least was a prophet, 1 Kings, 
ii. Amos, vii. 14, 15. When the igno- 
rant notions of Pagans, the \ ices of their 
practice, and the idolatry of their pre- 
tended worship, were, in some sad pe- 
30

riods incoi-])orated into the Jewish reli- i 
gioii by the princes of that nation, the 
prophets and all the seers protested 
against this apostacy, and they were 
persecuted for so doing. Shemaiah 
preached to Rehoboam, the princes, 
and all the people, at Jerusalem, 2 
Chron. xii. 5. Azariah and Hanani 
preached to Asa and his army, 2 Chron. 
XV. 1, &amp;c. xvf. 7. Micaiah to Ahab. 
Some of them opened schools, or houses 
of instruction, and there to 'their disci- 
ples tliey taught the pure religion of 
Moses. At N^aioth, in the suburbs of 
Ramah, there was one, where Samuel 
dwelt ; there was another at Jericho, 
and a third at Bethel, to which Elijah 
and Elisha often resorted. Thither tlie 
people went on Sabbath days and at 
new moons, and received public lessons 
of piety and morality, 1 Sam. xix. 18. 
2 Kings, ii. 3, 5. 2 Kings, iv. 2, 3. 
Through all this period there was a dis- 
mal confusion of the useful ordinance of 
public preaching. Sometimes they had 
no open vision, and the word of the 
Lord was pi'ccious or scarce : the peo- 
ple heard it only now and then. At 
other times they were left without 
a teaching priest, and without law. And, 
at othtr seasons again, itinerants, both 
princes, priests, and Levites, were sent 
through all the country to carry the 
book of the law, and to teach in the 
cities. In a woi-d, preaching flourished 
when pure religion grew ; and when 
the last decayed, the first was sup- 
pressed. Moses had not appropriated 
preaching to any order of men : per- 
sons, places, times, and manners, were 
all left open and discretional. Many of 
the discourses were preached in camps 
and courts, in streets, schools, cities, 
and villages, sometimes with great com- 
posure and coolness, at other times with 
vehement action and rapturous energy ; 
sometimes in a plain blunt style, at other 
times in all the magnificent pomp of 
Eastern allegory. On some occasions, 
the preachers appeared in public with 
visible signs, with implements of war, 
yokes of slavery, or something adapted 
to their subject. They gave lectures on 
these, held them up to view, girded 
them on, broke them in pieces, rent 
their garments, rolled in the dust, and 
endeavoured, Ijy all the methods they 
could devise agreeably to the customs 
of their country, to impress the minds 
of their auditors with the nature and 
importance of their doctrines. These 
men were highly esteemed by the pious 
part of the nation ; and princes thought 
proper to keep seers and others, who 
•were scribes, who read and expounded 



tlie law, 2 Chron. xxxiv. 29, 30. xxxv. 
15. Hence false prophets, bad men 
who found it worth while to affect to be 
good, crowded the courts of princes. 
Jezebel, an idolatress, had four hundred 
prophets of Baal ; and Ahab, a pretend- 
ed worshipper of Jehovah, had as many 
pretended prophets of his own profes- 
sion, 2 Chron. xviii. 5. 

When the Jews were carried captive 
into Babylon, the prophets who were 
with them inculcated the principles of 
religion, and endeavoured to ])ossess 
their minds with an aversion to idolatry ; 
and to the success of preaching we may 
attribute the re-conversion of the Jews 
to the belief and worship of one God ; a 
conversion that remains to this day. 
The Jews have since fallen into horrid 
crimes ; but they have never since this 
period lapsed into idolatry, Hosea, 2d 
and 3d chap. Ezekiel, 2d, 3d, and 34th 
chap. There were not Avanting, how- 
ever, multitudes of false prophets among 
them, whose characters are strikingly 
delineated by the true prophets, and 
which the reader may see in the 13th 
chapter of Ezekiel, 56th Isaiah, 23d 
Jeremiah. When the seventy years of 
the captivity were expired, the good 

firophets and preachers, Zembbabel, 
oshua, Haggai, and otliers, having con- 
fidence in the word of God, and aspiring 
after their natural, civil, and religious-, 
rights, endeavoured by all means to ex- 
tricate themselves and their country- 
men from that mortifying state into 
which the crimes of tlieir. ancestors had 
brought them. They wept, fasted, 
prayed, preached, prophesied, and at 
length prevailed. The chief instru- 
ments were Nehemiah and Ezra : the 
first was governor, and reformed their 
civil state ; the last was a scribe of the 
law of the (iod of heaven, and address- 
ed himself to ecclesiastical matters, in 
which he rendered the noblest service 
to his country, and to all posterity. He 
collected ani collated manuscripts of 
the sacred writings, and an-anged and 
published the holy canon in its present, 
form. , To this he added a second work 
as necessary as the former : he revived 
and neAV-modelled public preaching, 
and exeinplified his plan in his own 
person. The Jcavs had almost lost in 
the seventy years' captivity their origi- 
nal language : that was now become 
dead ; and they spoke a jargon made up 
of their own language and that of the 
Chaldeans and other nations with whom 
they had been confounded. Formerly 
preachers had only explained subjects; 
now they were obliged to explain words; 
words which, in the sacred code, were

become obsolete, equivocal, or dead. 
Houses were now opened, not for cere- 
monial worship, as sacrificing, for this 
was confined to the temple ; but for mo- 
ral obedience, as praying, preaching, 
reading the law, divine worship, and so- 
cial duties. These houses were called 
synagogues; the people repaired thither 
morning and evening for pi-ayer; and 
on sabbaths and "festivals the law was 
read and expounded to them. We have 
a short but beautiful description of the 
manner of Ezra's first preaching, Ne- 
hemiah, viii. Upwards of fifty thou- 
sand people assembled in a street, or 
large square, near the Water-gate. It 
was early in the morning of a sabbath 
day. A pulpit of wood, in the fashion 
of a small tower, was placed there on 
purpose for the preacher ; and this tur- 
ret was supported by a scaffold, or tem- 
porary gallery, where, in a wing on the 
right 'hand of the pulpit, sat six of the 
principal preachers ; and in another, on 
the left, seven." Thirteen other princi- 
pal teachers, and many Levites, were 
present also on scaffolds erected for the 
purpose, alternately to officiate. When 
Ezra ascended the pulpit, he produced 
and opened the book of the law, and the 
whole congregation instantly rose up 
from their seats, and stood. Then he 
offered up prayer and praise to God, 
the people bowing their heads, and wor- 
shipping the Lord with their faces to the 
ground ; and, at the close of the pray- 
er, with uplifted hands, they solemn- 
ly pronounced, Amen, Amen. Then, 
all standing, Ezra, assisted at times by 
the Levites, read the law distinctly, 
gave the sense, and caused them to un- 
derstand the reading. The sermons de- 
livered so affected the hearers, that they 
wept excessively ; and about noon the 
sorrow became so exuberant and im- 
measurable, that it was thought neces- 
sary by the governor, the preacher, and 
the Levites, to restrain it. Go your 
way, said they ; eat tlie fat, drink, the 
sweet, send portions unto them for whom 
nothing is prepared. The wise and be- 
nevolent sentiments of these noble souls 
were imbibed by the whole congrega- 
tion, and fifty thousand troubled hearts 
were calmed in a moment. Home they 
returned, to eat, to drink, to send por- 
tions and to make mirth, because they 
had understood the words that were de- 
clared unto them. Plato was alive at 
this time, teaching dull philosophy to 
cold academics; but what was he, and 
what was Xenophon or Demosthenes, 
or any of the Pagan orators, in comj^a- 
rison with these rnen ? From this period 
to that erf the appearance of Jesus Christ, 



puljlic preaching was universal : syiia- 
gogues were multiplied, vast numbers 
attended, and elders and rulers were 
appointed for the purpose of order and 
instniction. 

The most celebrated preacher that 
arose before the appearance of Jesus 
Christ was John the Baptist. He was 
commissioned from heaven to be the 
hai-binger of the Messiah. He took 
Elijah for his model ; and as the times 
were very much like those in which 
that prophet lived, he chose a doctrine 
and a method very much resembling 
those of tliat venerable man. His sub- 
jects were few, plain, and important. 
His style was vehement, images bold, 
his deportment solemn, his actions ea- 
ger, and his morals strict; but this 
bright moi-ning-star gave way to the 
illustrious Sun of Righteousness, who 
now arose on a benighted world. Jesus 
Christ certainly was the prince of 
preachers. Who can but admire the 
simplicity and majesty of his style, the 
beauty of his images, the alternate soft- 
ness and severity of his address, the 
choice of his subjects, the gracefulness 
of his deportment, and the indefatiga- 
bleness of his zeal ? Let the reader 
charm and solace himself in the study 
and contemplation of the character, ex- 
cellencv, and dignity of this best of 
preachers, as he will find them delinea- 
ted by the evangelists. 

The apostles exactly copied their di- 
vine Master. They formed multitudes 
of religious societies, and were abun- 
dantly successful in their labours. They 
confined their attention to religion, and 
left the school to dispute, and politicians 
to intrigue. Tlie doctrines they preach- 
ed, they supported entirely by evidence; 
and neither had nor required such as- 
sistance as human laws or worldly po- 
licy, the eloquence of the schools or the 
terror of arms, the charm of money or 
the tricks of tradesmen, could afford 
them. 

! The apostles being dead, every thing 
came to pass as they had foretold. The 
whole Christian system underwent a 
miserable change ; preaching shared 
the fate of other institutions, and this 
glory of the primitive church was now 
generalFy degenerated. Those writers 
whom we call the Fathers, howe^'er, 
held u]) to view'bv some as models of 
imitation, do not deserve that indiscri- 
minate praise ascribed to them. Chris- 
tianity, it is true, is fouhd in their 
writings ; but how sadly incorporated 
with Pagan philosopliv and Jewish al- 
legory ! It must, indeed, be allowed,, 
that, in general, the simplicity of Chris- 



PRE

PRE 



tianity was maintained, though under 
gradual decaj^ during the three first 
centuries. The next five centuries pro- 
duced many pious and excellent preach- 
ers both in the Latin and Gi-eek 
churches, though the doctrine conti- 
nued to degenerate. The Greek pul- 
pit was adorned with some eloquent 
orators. Basil, bishop of Gsesarea, John 
Chrysostom, pi-eacher at Antioch, and 
afterwards patriarch (as he was called) 
of Constantinople, and Gregory Nazian- 
zen, who all flourished in the fourth 
century, seem to have led the fashion of 
preaching in the Greek church : Jerom 
and Augustin did the same in the Latin 
church. For some time, preaching was 
common to bishops, elders, deacons, 
and private brethren in the primitive 
church : in process, it was restrained to 
the bishop, and to such as he should ap- 
point. 1 hey called the appointment 
ordination ; and at last attached I know 
not what ideas of mystery and influence 
to the word, and of dominion to the bi- 
shop who pronounced it. When a bi- 
shop or preacher travelled, he claimed 
no authority to exercise the duties of 
his function, unless he were invited by 
the churches where he attended public 
woi-ship. The first preachers differed 
much in pulpit action ; the greater part 
used very moderate and sober gesture. 
They delivered their sermons all ex- 
tempore, while there were notaries who 
took down what they said. Sermons in 
those days were all in the vulgar tongue. 
The Greeks preached in Greek, the 
Latins in Latin. They did not preach 
by the clock (so to speak,) but were 
sl'ioit or long as they saw occasion, 
though an hour was about the usual 
time. Sermons were generally both 
preached and heard standing ; but some- 
times both speaker and auditors sat, 
especially the aged and the infirm. The 
fathers were fond of allegory ; for Ori- 
gen,,that everlasting allegorizer, had 
set them the example. Before preach- 
ing, the preacher usually went into a 
X'cstry to pray, and afterwards to speak 
to such as came to salute him. He 
prayed with his eyes shut in the pulpit. 
The fii'st word the preacher uttered to 
the people, when he ascended the pul- 
pit, was "Peace be with vou," or "The 
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love 
of God, and the fellowship of the Holy 
Ghost, be with you all ;" to which the 
assembly at first added, " Amen :" and, 
in after times, they answered, "And 
with thy spirit." Degenerate, however, 
as these days were in comparison with 
those of the apostles, yet they were gold- 
en ages in comparison wkh the times 



that followed, when metaphysical rea- 
sonings, mystical divinity, yea, Aristo- 
telian categories, and reading the lives 
of saints, were substituted in the place 
of sermons. The pulpit became a stage, 
where ludicrous priests obtained the 
vulgar laugh by the lowest kind of wit, 
especially at the festivals of Christmas 
and Easter. 

But the glorious reformation was the 
offspring of preaching, by which man- 
kind were informed : there was a stan- 
dard, and the religion of the times was 
put to trial by it. The avidity of the 
common people to read Scripture, and 
to hear it expounded, was wonderful ; 
and the Papists were so fully convinced 
of the benefit of frequent public instruc- 
tion, that they who were justly called 
unpreaching prelates, and whose pul- 
pits, to use an expression of Latimer, had 
been bells without clappers for many a 
long year, were obliged for shame to 
set up regular preaching again. 

The church of Rome has produced 
some great preachers since the refor- 
mation, but not equal to the reformed 
preachers ; and a question naturally 
arises here, which it would be unpar- 
donable to pass over in silence, concern- 
ing the singular effect of the preaching 
of the reformed, which was general, 
national, universal reformation. 

In the darkest times of popery there 
had arisen now and then some ifamous 
popular preachers, who had zealously 
inveighed against the .vices of their 
times, and whose sermons had produced 
sudden and amazing effects on their au- 
ditors, but all these effects had died 
away with the preachers who produced 
them, and all things had gone back into 
the old state. Law, learning, commerce, 
society at large, had not been improved. 
— Here a new scene opens ; preachers 
arise less popular, perhaps less indefa- 
tigable and exemplaiy ; their sermons 
produce less striking immediate effects ; 
and yet their auditors go away, and 
agree by whole nations to reform. 

Jerome Savonarola, Jerome Nami, 
Capistran, Connecte, and many others, 
had produced by their sermons, great 
immediate effects. When Connecte 
preached, the ladies lowered their head- 
dresses, and committed quilled caps by 
hundreds to the flames. When Narni 
taught the populace in Lent, from the 
pulpits of Rome, half the city went from 
his sermons, crying along the streets, 
Lord have mercy ufion us; Christ have 
mercy upon us; so that in only one pas- 
sion week, two thousand crowns worth 
of ropes were sold to make scourges 
with J and when he preached before the

pope to cai'dinals and bishops, and |)aint- 
ed the crime of non-residence in its own 
colours, he frightened thirty or forty 
bishops who heard him, instantly home 
to their dioceses. In the pulpit of the 
uni%ersity of Salamanca he mduced eight 
hundred students to quit all woi-ldly 
prospects of honour, riches, and plea- 
sures, and to become penitents in di- 
vers monasteries. Some of this class 
■yvere martyrs too. We know the fate 
of Savonarola, and more might b§ add- 
ed : but all lamented the momtntary 
duration of the eflFects produced by their 
labours. Narni himself was so disgusted 
with his office, that he renounced preach- 
ing, and shut himself up in his cell to 
mourn over his irreclaimable contempo- 
raries ; for bishops went back to court, 
and rope-makers lay idle again. 

Our I'eformers taught all the good 
doctrines which had been taught by 
these men, and thej^ added two or three 
more, by which they laid the axe to the 
root of apostacy, and produced general 
information. Instead of appealing to 

Eopes, and canons, and founders, and 
ithers, they only quoted them, and re- 
feri'ed their auditors to the Holy Scrip- 
tures for lanu. Pope Leo X. did not 
know this when he told Prierio, who 
complained of Luther's heresv. Friar 
Martin had a fine geniusl They also 
taught the people w-iiat little they knew 
of Christian liberty; and so led them 
into a belief that they might follow their 
oivri ideas in religion, without the con- 
sent of a confessor, a diocesan, a pope, 
or a council. They went farther, and 
laid the stress of all religion on justify- 
ing faith. This obliged the people to 
get acquainted with Christ, the object 
of their faith ; aYid thus they Avei'e led 
into the knowledge of a character alto- 
gether different from what ttiey saw in 
their old guides ; a character which it 
is impossible to know, and not to admire 
and imitate. The old papal popular 
sennons had gone oflf like a charge of 
gunpowder, producing only a fright, a 
bustle, and a black face ; but those of 
the newe learninge, as the monks called 
them, were small hearty seeds, which, 
being sown in the honest hearts of the 
multitude, and watered with the dew of 
heaven, softly vegetated, and imper- 
ceptibly unfolded blossoms and fruits of 
inestimable value. 

These eminent servants of Christ ex- 
celled in various talents, both in the 
{mlpit and in private. Knox came down 
ike a thunder-storm ; Calvin resembled 
a whole day's set rain ; Beza was a 
shower of the softest dew. Old Lati- 
mer, in a coarse frieze gov/n, trudged 



afoot, his Testament hanging at one end 
of his leathei'n giixile, and his spectacles 
at the other, and without ceremony in- 
structed the people in rustic style from 
a hollow tree ; while the courtly Ridley 
in satin and fur taught the same princi- 
ples in the cathedral of the metropolis. 
Cranmer, thougli a timorous man, ven- 
tured to give king Henry the Eighth a 
New Testament, with the label, Whore- 
7nongers and adulterers God will 
judge; while Knox, who said, there was 
nothing in the pleasant face of a lady to 
affray him, assured the queen of Scots, 
that, " If there were any spark of the 
Spirit of God, yea, of honesty and wis- 
dom in her, she would not be offended 
with his affirming in his sermons, that 
the diversions of her court were dia- 
bolical crimes, — evidences of impiety 
or insanity." These men were not all 
accomplished scholars ; but they all 
gave proof enough that they were 
honest, hearty, and disinterested in the 
cause of religion. 

All Europe pi-oduced great and ex- 
cellent preachers, and some of the more 
studious and sedate reduced their art 
of public preaching to a system, and 
taught rules of a good sermon. Bishop 
Wilkins enumerated, in 1646, upwards 
of sixty who had written on the subject. 
Several of these are valuable treatises, 
full of edifying instructions ; but all are 
on a scale too large, and, by affecting to 
treat of the whole office of a minister, 
leave that capital branch, public preach- 
ing, unfinished and vague. 

One of the most important articles of 
pulpit science, that which gives life and 
energy to all the rest, and without which 
all the rest are nothing but a vain pa- 
rade, either neglected or exploded in 
all these treatises. It is essential to the 
ministration of the divine word by pub- 
lic preaching, that preachers be allowed 
to form principles of their own, and 
that their sermons contain their real 
sentiments, the fruits of their own in- 
tense thought and meditation. Preach- 
ing cannot be in a good state in those 
communities, where the shameful traf- 
fic of buying and seUing manuscript ser- 
mons is carried on. Moreover, all the 
animating encouragements that arise 
from a free unbiassed choice of the peo- 
ple, and from their uncontaminated, dis- 
interested applause, should be left open 
to stimulate a generous youth to excel. 
Command a man to utter what he has 
no inclination to propagate, and what he 
does not even believe ; threaten him, at 
the same time, with all the miseries of 
life, if he dare to follow his own ideas, 
and to promulgate his own sentiments,

Since the reformers, we have had 
multitudes who have entered into their 
views with disinterestedness and suc- 
cess ; and, in the present times, botli in 
the church and among dissenters, names 
could be mentioned which would do 
lionour to any nation ; for tliough there 
are too many who do not fill up that 
impoitant station with proportionate 
piety and talents, yet we have men who 
are conspicuous for their extent of 
knowledge, depth of experience, ori- 
ginality of thought, fervency of zeal, 
consistency of deportment, and great 
usefulness in the Christian church. 
May their numbers still be increased, 
and their exci'tions in the cause of truth 
be eminently crowned with the divine 
blessing! See i^o6mso7z's Claiide,vo\.u.

PREADAMITE, a denomination 
given to the inhabitants of the earth, 
concei\'ed by some people to have lived 
before Adam, 

Isaac de la Pereyra, in 1655, publish- 
ed a book to evince the reality of Pread- 
amites, by which he gained a considera- i 
ble number of proselytes to the opinion : I 
but the answer of Demarets, professor | 
t)f theology at Groningen, published the I 
year following, put a stop to its pro- 
gress, though Pereyra made a reply. 

His system was this. The Jews he 
calls Adamites, and supposes them to 
have issued from Adam ; and gi\ es the 
title Preadajiiitcs to the Gentiles, whom 
he supposes to have been a long time 
before Adam. But this being express- 
ly contrary to the first words of Gene- 
sis, Pereyra had recourse to the fabu- 
lous antiquities of the Egyptians and 
Chaldeans, and to some idle rabbins, 
%vho imagined there had been another 
world before that described- by Moses. 
He was apprehended by the inquisition 
in Flanders, and very rouglily used, 
though in the service of the dauphin. 
But iie apjjealed from their sentence to 
Rome, whither he went. in the time of 
Alexander VII., and where he printed 
a retraction of his book of Preadam- 
ites. 

The arguments against the Preadam- 
ites are these. The sacied history of 
Moses assures us that Adam and Eve 
&gt;vere the first persons that were created 
on the earth. Gen. i. 26. Gen. ii. 7. Our 
Saviour confirmed this when he said, 
" From the beginning of the creation 
God made them, male and female," 



Marl^ X. 6. It is undeniable that he 
speaks this of Adam and Eve, because 
in the next verse he uses the same words 
as those in Gen. ii. 24. "Therefore shall 
a man leave his father and mother, and 
cleave unto his wife." It is also clear 
from Gen. iii. 20, where it is said, that 
"Adam called his wife's name Eve, be- 
cause she was the mother of all living;" 
that is, she was the source and root of 
all men and women in the world ; which 
plair^.y intimates that there was no other 
womLn that was such a mother. Fi- 
nally, Adam is expressly called twice, 
bv the apostle Paul, the Jiist man, 
I'Cor. XV. 45, 47. 

PRECEPT, a nile given by a supe- 
rioV ; a .direction or command. The 
firecepts of religion, says Saurin, are as 
essential as the doctrines; and religion 
will as certainly sink, if the morality be 
subverted, as if the theology be under- 
mined. The doctrines are only pro- 
posed to us as the ground of our duty- 
See Doctrine. 

PREDESTINARIANS, those who 
believe in predestination. See Pre- 

DESTINA.TION. 

PREDESTINATION is the decree 

of God, whereby he hath for his own 
glory fore-ordained whatever comes to 
pass. The verb predestinate is of Latin 
original {/nwdestino,) and signifies in 
that tongue to deliberate betore-hand 
with one's self how one shall act, and, 
I in consequence of such deliberation, to 
I constitute, fore-ordain, and predeter- 
I mine, wliere, when, how, and by whom 
I any thing shall l)e done, and to wiiat end 
it shall be done. So the Greek word 
7rp:M?pi(M, which exactly answers to the 
English word predestinate, and is ren- 
dered by it, signifies to resolve before- 
hand with one's self what shall be done, 
and before the thing resolved on is ac- 
tiialK effected; to appoint it to some 
certain use, and direct it to some deter- 
minate end. This doctrine has been the 
occasion of considerable disputes and 
controversies among divines. On the 
one side it has been observed, that it is 
impossible to reconcile it with our ideas 
of the jiLstice and goodness of God, that 
it makes God to be the author of sin, 
destroys moral distinction, and renders 
all our efforts useless. Predestinarians 
deny these consequences, and endea- 
vour to prove this docti'ine from the 
consideration of the perfections of the 
divine nature, and from Scripture testi- 
mony. If his knowledge, say they, be 
infinite anduncliangeable, he must have 
known every thing from eternity. If we 
allow the attribute of fireficience, the 
idea of a decree must certainly be be.*

iicved also, for how can an action that 
is really to come to pass be foreseen, if 
it be not determined:* God knew every 
thing from the beginning ; but this he 
could not have known it he had not so 
determined it. If, also, God be infinitely 
wise, it cannot be conceived that he 
would lea^e things at random, and have 
no plan. He is a God of order, and this 
order he observes as strictly in the mo- 
ral as in the natural world, however 
confused things may appear to us. To 
conceive otherwise of God, is to degrade 
him, and is an insult to his perfections. 
If he, then, be wise and unchangeable, 
no new idea or purpose can arise in his 
mind; no alteration of his plan can take 
place, upon condition of his creatures 
acting in this or that way. To say that 
this doctrine makes him the autlior of 
sin, is not justifiable. We all allow om- 
nipotence to be an attribute of Deity, 
and that by this attribute he could have 
p\-evented sin from entering into the 
world, had he chosen it ; yet we see he 
did not. Now he is no "more the au- 
thor of sin in one case than the other. 
May we not ask. Why floes he suffer 
those inequalities of Providence ? Why 
permit^ whole nations to lie in idolatry 
for ages :• Why leave men to the most 
cruel barbarities ? Why punish the sins 
of the fathers in the children ? In a 
word. Why permit the world at large 
to be subject to pains, crosses, losses, 
evils of even' kind, and that for so many 
thousands of years? And, yet, will any 
dare call the Deity unjust P The fact is, 
our finite minds know but little of the 
nature .of divine justice, or any cJther of 
his attributes. But, supposing there are 
difficulties in this subject (and what 
subject is without it f) the Scripture 
abounds with passages which at once 
])i'ove the doctrine. Matt. xxv. 34. Rom. 
\-iii. 29, 30. Eph. i. 3, 6, 11. 2 Tim. i. 9. 
2 Thess. ii. 13. 1 Pet. i. 1, ± John vi.

xvli. 8. Dan. iv. 35. 1 Thess. v. 19. 
Matt. xi. 26. Exod. iv. 21. Prov. xvi. 4. 
Acts xiii. 48. The moral uses of this 
doctrine are these. 1. It hides pride from 
man. — 2. Excludes the idea of chance. 
—3. Exalts the grace of God. — 4. Ren- 
ders salvation certain. — 5. Affords be- 
lievers great consolation. See Decrees

PRE-EXISTENCE OF JESUS 
CHRIST, is his existence before he 
was bom of the Virg-in Maiy. That he 
really did exist before, is plain from 
John iii. 13. John vi. 50, &amp;C. John xvii. 
John viii. 58 1 John i. 4 : but there are 
various opinions respecting this exist- 
ence. Some acknowledge, that in Je- 
sus Christ there is a divine nature, a ra- 
tional soul, and a human body. His 
body, they think, was formed in the 
Virgin's womb ; his human soul, tliey 
supi&gt;ose, was the first and most excel- 
lent of all the works of God ; was 
brought into existence before the crea- 
tion of" the world, and subsisted in hap- 
py union in heaven with the second per- 
son in t!ie Godhead, till his incarnation. 
These divines differ from those called 
Arians, for the latter ascribe to Christ 
only a created deity, whereas the former 
hold his true and proper divinity ; they 
differ from the Socinians, who believe 
no existence of Christ before his incar- 
nation : they differ from the Sabellians, 
who only own a trinity of names : they 
differ, also, from the generally received 
opinion, which is, that the human soul 
began to exist in his mother's womb, \n 
exact conformity to that likeness unto 
his brethren, of v/hich St. Paul speaks, 
Fleb. ii. 17. The writers in favour of 
the pre-existence of Jesus Christ's hu- 
man soul recommend their thesis by 
these arguments. 

1. Christ is represented as his Father's 
messenger, or angel, being distinct from 
his Father, sent by his Father long be- 
fore his incarnation, to perform actions 
which seem to be too low for the dignity 
of pure Godhead. The appearances of 
Clirist to the patriarchs are described 
like the appearances of an angel, or man 
really distinct from God ; yet such a 
one, in whom God, or Jehovah, had -a 
peculiar indwelling, or with v;hom the 
divine nature had a personal union. 

2. Christ, when he came into the 
world, is said, in several passages of 
Scripture, to have divested himself of 
some glory which he had before his in- 
carnation. Now if there had existed 
before this time nothing but his divine 
nature, this divine nature could not pro- 
perly divest itself of any glory. I have 
glorified thee on earth; I have finished 
the work thou gavest me to do. And 
71010, Father, glorify thou me with 
thine omn self, with the glory which I 
had with thee before the world was. — 
Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, that though ne was rich, yet for 
your sakes he became fioor, that ye 
through his fioverty might be rich, 
John xvii. 4, 5. 2 Cor. viii. 9. It cannor 



PRE 



480 



PRE 



be said of God that he became poor : he 
is infinitely self-sufficient ; he is neces- 
sarily and eternally rich in perfections 
and glories. Nor can it be said of Christ 
as man, that he was rich, if he wei'e 
never in a richer state before, than 
■while he was on earth. 

It seems needful that the soul of Christ 
should pre-exist, that it might have an 
opp'M'tunity to give its previous actual 
consent to the great and painful under- 
taking of atonement for our sins. It was 
the human soul of Christ that endured 
the weakness and pain of his infant 
state, all the labours and fatigues of life, 
the reproaches of men, and the suffer- 
ings of death. The divine nature is in- 
capable of suffering. The covenant of 
redemption between the Father and 
the Son is therefore represented as be- 
ing made before the foundation of the 
world. To suppose that simple deity or 
the divine essence, which is the same in 
all the three personalities, should make 
a covenant with itself, is inconsistent. 

Christ is the angel to whom God was 
in a peculiar manner united, and who in 
this union made all the divine appear- 
ances related in the Old Testament. 

God is often represented in Scripture 
as appearing in a visible manner, and 
assuming a human form. See Gen. iii. 
8. xvii. 1. xxviii. 12. xxxii. 24. Exod. ii. 
2, and a varietv of other passages. 

The Lord Jehovah, when he came 
down to visit men, carried some ensign 
of divine majesty : he was sun-ounded 
with some splendid appearance. Such 
a light often appeared at the door of the 
tabei-nacle, and fixed its abode on the 
ark, between the cherubims. It was by 
the Jews called the Shekinah, i. e. the 
habitation of God. Hence he is de- 
sci'ibed as dwelling in light and clothed 
Tjith light as ivith a garment. In the 
midst of this brightness there seems to 
have been sometimes a human shape 
and figure. It was probably of this hea- 
venly light that Christ divested himself 
when he was made flesh. With this he 
was covered at his transfiguration in 
the Mount, when his garments were 
ivhite as the light ; and at his ascension 
into heaven, when, a bright cloud receiv- 
ed, or invested him : and when he ap- 
peared to John, Rev. i. 13. and it was 
with this he prayed his Father would 
glorify him. 

Sometimes the great and blessed God 
appeared in the form of a man or angel. 
It IS evident that the true God resided 
in this man or angel ; because on ac- 
count of this union to proper deity, the 
angel calls himself God, the Lord God. 
He assumes the most exalted names 



and characters of Godhead. And the 
spectators, and sacred historians, it is 
evident, considered him as true and 
proper God : they paid him the highest 
worship and obedience. He is properly 
styled the angel of God's presence — 
The (messenger oi-^ angel of the cove^ 
nant, Isa. Ixxii. 1. Mal.'iii. 1. 

The same angel of the Lord was the 
particular God and King of the Israel- 
ites. It was he who made a covenant 
with the patriarchs, who appeared to 
Moses in the burning bush, who re- 
deemed the Israelites from Egvpt, who 
conducted them through the wilderness, 
who gave the law at Sinai, and trans- 
acted the affiirs of the ancient church. 

The angels who have appeared since 
our blessed Saviour became incarnate, 
have never assumed the names, titles» 
characters, or worship, belonging to 
God. Hence we may infer that the an- 
gel who, under the Old Testament, 
assumed divine titles, and accepted 
religious worship, was that peculiar 
angel of God's presence,^ in whom 
God resided, or who was* united to 
the Godhead in a peculiar manner ; 
even the pre-existent soul of Christ, 
who afterwards took flesh and blood 
upon him, and was called Jesus Christ 
on earth. 

Christ represents himself as one with 
the Father: I and the Father are one, 
John, X. 30. xiv. 10, 11. There is, we 
may hence infer, such a peculiar union 
between God and the man Christ Jesus, 
both in his pre-existent and incarnate 
state, that he may be properly called 
God-nTa7i in one complex person. 

Among those expressions of Scripture 
which discover the pre-existence of 
Christ, there are several from which we 
may derive a certain proof of his divi- 
nity. Such are those places in the Old 
Testament, where the angel who ap- 
peared to the ancients is called God, the 
Almighty God, Jehovah, the Lord of 
Hosts, lam that I am, Sec. 

Ur. Watts supposes, that the doctrine 
of the pre-existence of the soul of Christ 
explains dark and difficult scriptures, 
and discovers many beauties and pro- 
prieties of expression in the word of 
God, which on any other plan lie unob- 
served : For instance, in Col. i. 15, &amp;c. 
Christ is described as the image of the 
invisible God, the first-born of e very- 
creature. His being the image of the in- 
visible God cannot refer merely to his 
divine nature; for that is as invisible in 
the Son as in the Father : therefore it 
seems to refer to his pre-existent soul 
in union with the Godhead. Again : 
when man is said to be created in the 



PRE

PRE 



image of God, Gen. i. 2. it may refer to 
the God-man, to Christ in his pre-ex- 
istent state. God says, Let us make 
man in our image, after our likeness. 
The word is redoubled, perhaps to inti- 
mate that Adam was made in the hke- 
ness of the human soul of Christ, as well 
as that he bore something of the image 
and resemblance of the divine nature. 

On the other side it is affirmed, that 
this doctrine of the pre-existence of the 
human soul of Christ weakens and sub- 
verts that of his personality. 1. A pure 
intelligent spirit, say the!^, the first, the 
most ancient, and the most excellent of 
creatures, created before the founda- 
tion of the world, so exactly resembles 
the second person of the Arlan trinity, 
that it is impossible to show the least 
difference, except in name. — 2. The 
pre-existent intelligence supposed in 
this doctrine, is so confounded with 
those other intelligences called angels, 
that there is great danger of mistaking 
this human soul for an angel, and so of 
making the person of Christ to consist 
of three natures. — 3. If Jesus Christ 
had nothing in common like the rest of 
manklBd except a body, how could this 
semi-conformity make him a real man .■* 
— 4. The passages quoted in proof of 
the pre-existence of the human soul of 
Jesus Christ are of the same sort with 
those which others allege in proof of 
the pre-existence of all human souls. — 
5. This opinion, by ascribing the dignity 
of the work of redemption to this sub- 
lime human soul, detracts from the deity 
of Christ, and renders the last as pas- 
sive as the first active. — 6. This notion 
is contrary to Scripture. St. Paul says, 
in all things it behoved him to be made 
like his brethren : he partook of all our 
infirmities, except sin. St. Luke says, 
he increased in stature and in wisdom,

tions, and an addition of certain severe

PRESBYTER. See next article; 
and articles Deacon, Elder. 

PRESBYTERIANS. The title Pres- 
bytei-ian comes from the Greek word 
ripto-BuTEpoj, which signifies senior or el- 
der, intimating that the government of 
the church in the New Testament was 
by presbyteries, that is, by association 
of ministers and ruling elders, possessed 
all of equal powers, without any supe- 
riority among them, either in office or 
order. The Presbyterians believe, that 
the authority of then- ministers to preacli 
the Gospel, to administer the sacra- 
ments of baptism and tiie Lord's sup- 
per, and to feed the flock of Christ, is 
derived from the Holy Ghost by the 
imposition of the hands of the presby- 
tery ; and they oppose the independent 
scheme of the common rights of Chris- 
tians by the same arguments which are 
used for that purpose by the Episcopa- 
lians. They affirm, however, that there 
is no order in the churcli as established 
by Christ and his apostles superior to 
that of presbyters ; that all ministers 
being ambassadors of Christ, are equal 
by their commission ; that presbyter 
and bishop, though different words, are 
of the same import; and that prelacy 
was gradually established upon the pri.- 
mitive practice of making the moderator 
or speaker of the presbytery a perma- 
nent officer. 

These positions they maintain against 
the Episcopalians by the following 
Scriptural arguments. — They oliserve. 
That the apostles planted churches by 
ordaining bishops and deacons in every 
city; that the ministers which in one 
verse are called bishops, are in the next 
perhaps denominated presbyters; that 
we no where read in the New Testa- 
ment of bishops, presbyters, and dea- 
cons, in any one church ; and that, 
therefore, we are under the necessity 
of concluding bishop and presbyter to 
be two names for the same church of- 
ficer. This is apparent from Peter's ex- 
hortation to the e/rfers or presbyters who 
were among the Jewish Christians. 
'The elders (presbyters) which are 
among vou I exhort, who am also an 
elder, arid a witness of the sufferings of 
Christ, and also a partaker of the glory 
that shall be revealed: feed the flock of 
God which is among you, taking the 
oversight thereof, {inKTxonouiln acting as 
bishops thereof,) not by constraint, bijt 
willingly ; not tor filthy lucre, but of a

I'Ciidy niiiul : neither ar, being lords 
over God's heritage, but being ensam- 
ples to the flock, 1 Pet. v. 2, 3. From 
this passage it is evident that the pres- 
byters not only fed the flock of God, but 
also governed that flock with episcopal 
powers ; and that the apostle himself, 
as a church officer, v/as nothing more 
than a presbyter or elder. The identity 
of the office of bishop and presbyter is 
still more apparent from Heb. xiii. 7, 
17. and 1 Thess. v. 13 ; for the bishops 
are there represented as governing the 
flock, speakmg to them the word of 
God, watching for their souls, and dis- 
charging various offices, which it is im- 
possible for any man to perfoi'm to more 
than one congregation. 

" From the last cited text it is evident 
that the bishops (Trgoic-lajjEvcus) of the 
Thessalonian churches had the pasto- 
ral care of no more souls than they 
could hold personal communion with in 
God's worship ; for they were such as 
all the people were to kiiovj, esteem, 
and love, as those that not only were 
over them, but also ' closely laboured 
among them, and admonished them.' 
But diocesan bishops, whom ordinarily 
the hundredth part of their flock never 
hear nor see, cannot be those bishops 
by whom that flock is admonished ; nor 
can they be what Pettr requires the bi- 
shops of the Jewish converts to be, en- 
samfiles to the fmck. It is the opinion 
of Dr. Hammond, who was a very learn- 
ed divine, and a zealot for episcopacy, 
that the elders whom the apostle James 
desires (Jam. v. 14.) the sick to call for, 
were of the highest permanent order of 
ecclesiastical officers ; but it is self-evi- 
dent that those elders cannot liave been 
diocesan bishops, otherwise the sick 
niustha\e been often without the reach 
of the remcch- proposed to them. 

" There is nothing in Scripture upon 
which the F^piscopalian is more ready 
to rest his cause tlian the alleged epis- 
copacy of Timothy and Titus, of whom 
the former is said to have been bishop 
of Ephesus, and the latter bishop of 
Crete ; yet the Presbyterian thinks it is 
clear as the noon-day sun, that the 
presbyters of Ephesus were supreme 
governors, under Christ, of tlie Ephe- 
sian churches, at the very time that 
Timothy is pretended to have been their 
proper diocesan. 

" In Acts, XX. 17, 8cc. we read, that 
' from Miletus Paul sent to Ephesus, 
and called the elders (presbyters) of 
the church . And when they were come 
to him, he said unto them. Ye know, from 
'the first day that I came into Asia, af- 
ter \frhat manner I have been with you 



at all seasons. And now, I know that 
ye all, among whom I have gone preach- 
mg the kingdom of God, shall see my 
face no more. Wherefore I take you 
to record this day, that I am pure from 
the 1)lood of all men. For I have not 
shunned to declare unto you all the 
counsel of God. Take heed, therefore, 
unto yourselves, and to ,all the flock 
over which the Holy Gg^ost hath made 
you overseers (sTria-xrjr.^us, bishofis,) to 
feed the church of God, wltich he hath 
purchased \vith his own blood. For I 
know this, that after my departure shall 
grievous wolves enter in among you, 
not sparing the flock. Also of your own 
selves shall men arise, speaking per- 
verse things, to draw away disciples af- 
ter them. Therefore watch, and re- 
member that, by the space of three 
years, I ceased not to warn every one 
night and day with tears. And now, 
brethren, I commend you to God, and 
to the word of his grace,' 8cc. 

" From this passage it is evident that 
there was in the city of Ephesus a plu- 
rality of pastors of equal authority, 
without any superior pastor or bishop 
over them ; for the apostle directs his 
discourse to them all in common, and 
gives them equal power' over the whole 
flock. Dr. Hammond, indeed, imagines, 
that the elders whom Paul called to Mi- 
letus, were the bis/io/is of jisia, and 
that he sent for them to Ephesus, be- 
cause that city was the metropolis of 
this province. But, were this opinion 
well founded, it is not conceivable that 
the sacred writer would have called 
them the elders of the chmxh of E/i/ie- 
fius, but the elders of the church in 
general, or the elders of the churches in 
,/tsia. Besides, it is to be remembered, 
that the apostle was in sucli haste to be 
at Jerusalem, that the sacred historian 
measures his time by days ; whereas it 
must have required several months to 
call together the bishops or elders of all 
the cities of Asia ; and he might cer- 
tainly have gone to meet them at Ephe- 
sus in less time than would be requisite 
for their meeting in that city, and pro- 
ceeding thence to him at Miletus. 1 hey 
must therefore have been either the 
joint pastors of one congregation, or the 
pastors of diflferent congregations in one 
city ; and as it was thus in Ephesus, so 
it was in Philippi ; for we find the apos- 
tle addressing his epistle ' to all . the 
saints in Jesus Christ which are at Phi- 
lippi, with the bishops and deacons.' 
from the passage before us it is like- 
wise plain, tliat the presbyters of Ephe- 
sus had not only the name, but the 
whole po%ver of bishops given to them

by the Holy Ghost ; for they ai'e en- 
joined to do the whole work of bishops 

— TToinaivEiv Ttiv £KxXn(7iav rov Sfou — which sig- 
nifies to rule as well as feed the church 
of God. Whence we see that the apos- 
tle makes the power oi govertmg inse- 
parable from that of fireach'ing and 
watching; and that, according to him, 
all who are preachers of God's word, 
and watchmen of souls, are necessarily 
rulers or governors of the church, witli- 
out being accountable for their manage- 
ment to any prelate, but only to their 
Lord Christ, from whom their power is 
derived. 

" It appears, therefore, that the apos- 
tle Paul, left in the church of Ephesus, 
which he had planted, no other succes- 
sors to himself than firesbyter-bisho/is, 
or Presbyterian ministers, and that lie 
did not devolve his power upon any 
prelate. Timothy, whom the Episco- 

Ealians allege to' have been the first 
ishop of Ephesus, was present when 
this settlement was made. Acts, xx. 5 ; 
and it is surely not to be supposed that, 
had he been their bishop, the apostle 
would have devolved the whole epis- 
copal power upon the presbyters before 
his face. If ever there were a season 
fitter than another for pointing out the 
duty of this supposed bishop to his dio- 
cese, and his presbyters' duty to him, it 
was surely when Paul was taking his 
final leave of them, and discoursing so 
pathetically concerning the duty of 
overseers, the coming of ravenous 
wolves, and the consequent hazard of 
the flock. In this farewell discourse he 
tells them that ' he had not shunned to 
declare unto them all the counsel of 
God.' But with what truth could this 
have been said, if obedience to a dio- 
cesan bishop had been any part of their 
duty, either at the time of the apostle's 
speaking, or at any futm-e pei-iod ? He 
foresaw that ravenous wol\ es would en- 
ter in among them, and that even some 
of 4;hemselves should arise speaking per- 
verse things ; and if, as the Episcopalians 
allege, diocesan ejjiscopacy was the re- 
medy provided for these evils, is it not 
strange, passing strange, that the in- 
spired preacher did not foresee that 
1 imothy, who was then standing beside 
him, was destined to fill that iniportant 
office ; or, if he did foi-esee it, that he 
omitted to recommend him to his future 
charge, and to give him proper instruc- 
tions for the discharge of his duty ? 

"But if Timothy was not bishop of 
Ephesus, what, it may be asked, was 
his office in that city ? for tliat he re- l 
sided there for some time, and was by 
the apostle invested with authoriky to i 



ordain and rebuke presbyters, are facts 
about which all parties are agreed, and 
which, indeed, cannot be controverted 
by any reader of Paul's epistles. To 
this the Presbyterian replies, with con- 
fidence, that the power which Timo- 
thy exercised in the church of Ephesus 
was that of an evangelist, Tim. ii. 4, 5. 
and not a fixed prelate. But, according 
to Euseliius, the work of an evangelist 
was, ' to lay the foundations of the faith 
in barbarous nations, and to constitute 
among them pastors, after which he 
passed on to other countries.' Accord- 
mgly we find that Timothy was resi- 
dent for a time at Philippi and Corinth 
(Phil. ii. 19. 1 Cor. iv. 17. xvi. 10, 11.) 
as well as Ephesus, and that he had as 
much authority over those churches as 
over that of which he is said to have 
been the fixed bishop. ' Now, if Timo- 
theus come, see that he may be with 
you without fear, for he worketh the 
work of the Lord, as I also do. Let no 
man, therefore, despise him.' This text 
might lead us to suppose that Timothy- 
was bishop of Corinth as well as of 
Ephesus ; for it is stronger than that 
upon which his episcopacy of the latter 
church is chiefly built. The apostle 
says, 1 Tim. i. 3. 'I besought thee to 
abide still at Ephesus, when I went into 
Macedonia, that thou mightest charge 
some that they teach no other doctrine.' 
But, had Timothy been the fixed bishop 
of that city, there would surely have 
been no necessity for beseeching h.mi to 
abide with his flock. It is to be observed, 
too, that tlie first epistle to Timothy, 
which alone was written to him during 
his residence at Ephesus, was of a date 
prior to Paul's meeting with the elders 
of that church at Miletus; for in the 
epistle he hopes to come to him shortly ; 
whereas he tells the elders at Miletus 
that they should see his face no more. 
This being the case, it is evident that 
Timothy was left by the apostle at 
Ephesus only to supply his place during 
his temporary absence at Macedonia ; 
and that he could not possibly have been 
constituted fixed bishop of that church, 
since the episcopal powers were afterr 
wards committed to the presbyters by 
the Holy Ghost in his presence'. 

"The i, '.entity of the office of bishop 
and presbyter JR-ing thus clearlv esta- 
blished, it 'follows, that the presbyterate 
is the highest permanent office- in the 
chiu'ch, and that every faithful pastor 
of a flock is successor to the apostles in 
every thing in which they were to have 
any successors. In the apostolic office 
there were indeed some thijij!,;^ peculiar

diate call by Christ, their infallibility, 
their being witnesses of our Lord's re- 
surrection, and their unlimited juris- 
diction over the whole woi'ld. These 
powers and privileges could not be con- 
veyed by imposition of hands to any suc- 
cessors, whether called presbyters or 
bishops ; but as rulers or office-bearers 
in particular cliurches, we have the 
confession of ' the very chiefest apos- 
tles,' Peter and John, that they were 
nothing more than presbyters, or pa- 
rish mmisters. This being the case, the 
dispute which has been so warmly agi- 
tated concerning the validity of Presby- 
terian ordination may be soon decided ; 
for if the ceremony of ordination be at 
all essential, it is obvious that such a 
ceremony performed by presbyters must 
be valid, as there is no higher order of 
ecclesiastics in the church by whom it 
can be performed. Accordingly we 
find, that Timothy himself, though said 
to be a bishop, was ordained by the lay- 
ing on of the hands of a presbytery. At 
that ordination, indeed, St. Paul pre- 
sided, but he could preside only as 
primus in fiaribus ; for we liave seen 
that, as permanent officers in the church 
of Christ, the apostles themselves were 
no more than presbyters. If the apos- 
tles' hands were imposed for any other 
pui-pose, it must have been to commu- 
nicate those charismata, or miraculous 
gifts of the Holy Spirit, which were 
then so frequent ; but which no modern 
presbyter or bishop will pretend to give, 
unless his understanding be clouded by 
the grossest ignorance, or perverted by 
the most frantic enthusiasm." 

The members of the church of Scot- 
land are strict Presbytei'ians. Their 
mode of ecclesiastical government was 
brought thither from Geneva by John 
Knox, the famous Scotch reformer, and 
who has been styled the apostle of 
Scotland. 

Their doctrines are Calvinistic, as 
may be seen in the confession of faith, 
and the larger and shorter catechisms ; 
though it is supposed that the clergy, 
when composing instructions, either for 
their respective parishes, or the public 
at large, are no more fettered by the 
confession, than the clergy of the church 
of England are by the thirty-nine arti- 
cles. Many in both communities, it 
seems, take a more extensive latitude 
than their formulas allow them. 

As to the church f^overninent among 
the Scotch Presbyterians, no one is igno- 
rant, that, from the first dawn of the 
reformation among us till the aera of the 
revolution, there was a pcrp'.tual strug- 
gle between the court and the people. 



for the establishment of an episcopal or 
a pi-esbyterian form : the former model 
of ecclesiastical polity was patronised 
by the house of Stuart on account of the 
support which it gave to the preroga- 
tives of the crown ; the latter was the 
favourite of the majority of the people, 
perhaps not so much on account ot its 
superior claim to apostolical institution, 
as because the laity are mixed with the 
clergy in church judicatories, and the 
two orders, which under episcopacy are 
kept so distinct, incorporated, as it were, 
hito one Ijody. In the Scottish churchj 
every regulation of public worship, 
every act of discipline, and every ec- 
clesiastical censure, which in other 
churches flows from the authority of a 
diocesan bishop, or from a convocation 
of the clergy, is the joint work of a 
certain number of clergymen and lay- 
men acting together with equal authori- 
ty, and deciding every question by a plu- 
rality of voices. The laymen who thus 
form an essential part of the ecclesias- 
tical courts of Scotland are called 7'uline- 
elders, and hold the same office, as we'll 
as the same name, with those brethren 
(Acts XV.) who joined with the apostles 
and elders at Jerusalem in determining 
the important question concerning the 
necessity of imposing upon the Gentile 
converts the ritual observances of the 
law of Moses. These lay-elders Paul 
enjoined Timothy, (1 Tim. v. 17.) to ac- 
count worthy of double honour, if they 
should rule well, and discharge the du- 
ties for which they were separated from 
the multitude of their brethren. In the 
church of Scotland every parish has two 
or three of those lay-elders, who are 
grave and serious persons chosen from 
among the heads of families, of known 
orthodoxy, and steady adherence to 
the worship, discipline, and government 
of the church. Being solemnly engaged 
to use their utmost endeavours for the 
suppression of vice and the cherishing 
of piety and virtue, and to exercise dis- 
cipline faithfully and diligently, the mi- 
nister, in the presence of the congT-ega- 
tion, sets them apart to their office by 
solemn prayer ; and concludes the cere- 
mony, which is sometimes called ordi- 
nation, with exhorting both elders and 
people to their respective duties. 

The kirk session, which is the lowest 
ecclesiastical judicatory, consists of the 
minister and those elders of the congre- 
gation. The minister is ex officio mo- 
derator, but has no negative voice over 
the decision of the session ; nor, indeed, 
has he a right to vote at all, unless when 
the voice of the elders are equal and 
opposite. He may, indeed, enter his 



PRE

protest against their sentence, if he 
think it improper, and appeal to the 
judgment of the presbytery ; but this 
privilege belongs equally to every elder, 
as well as to every person who may be- 
lieve himself aggrieved by the pro- 
ceedings of the session. The deacons, 
whose proper office it is to take care of 
the poor, may be present in every ses- 
sion, and offer their counsel on all ques- 
tions that come before it ; but, except 
in what relates to the distribution of 
alms, they have no decisive vote with 
the minister and elders. 

The next judicatory is the firesbytery, 
which consist of all the pastors within a 
certain district, and one ruling elder 
from each parish, commissioned by his 
brethren to represent, in conjunction 
with the minister, the session of that 
parish. The presbytery treats of such 
matters as concern the particular 
churches within its limits ; as the ex- 
amination, admission, ordination, and 
censuring of ministers ; the licensing of 
probationers, rebuking the gross or con- 
tumacious sinners, the directing the sen- 
tence of excommunication, the deciding 
upon references and appeals from kirk 
sessions, I'esolving cases of conscience, 
explaining difficulties in doctrine or dis- 
cipline ; and censuring, according to the 
word of God, any heresy or erroneous 
doctrine which hath either been public- 
ly or privately maintained within the 
bounds of its jurisdiction. Some of them 
have frankly acknowledged that they 
cannot altogether approve of that part 
of her constitution which gives an equal 
vote, in questions of heresy, to an illite- 
rate mechanic and his enlightened pas- 
tor. We are persuaded (say they) that 
it has been the source of much trouble 
to many a pious clergyman, who from 
the laudable desire of explaining the 
Scriptui'es, and declaring to his flock 
all the counsel of God, has employed a 
'variety of expressions of the same im- 
port to illustrate those articles of faith, 
which may be obscurely expressed in 
the established standards. The fact, 
however, is, that in presbyters the only 
prerogatives which the pastors have 
over the iniling elders are, the power of 
ordination by imposition of hands, and 
the privilege of having the moderator 
chosen from their body. 

From the judgment of the presbytery 
there lies an appeal to the provincial 
synod, which ordinarily meets twice in 
the year, and exercises over the pres- 
byteries within the province a jurisdic- 
tion similar to that which is vested in 
each presbytery over the several kirk 
sessions within its bounds. Of these sy- 



nods there are in the church of Scot- 
land fifteen, which are composed of the 
members of the several presbyteries 
within the respective provinces which 
give names to the synods. 

The highest authority in the church 
of Scotland is the general asnemblyf 
which consists of a certain number ot 
ministers and ruling elders delegated 
from each presbyteiy, and of commis- 
sioners from the universities and royal 
boroughs. A presbytery in which there 
are fewer than twelve parishes sends 
to the general assembly two ministers 
and one ruling elder; if it contain be- 
tween twelve and eighteen ministers, it 
sends three of these, and one ruling el- 
der : if it contain between eighteen and 
twenty-four ministers, it sends four mi- 
nisters, and two ruling elders ; and of 
twenty-four ministers, when it contains 
so many, it sends five, with two niling 
elders. Every royal borough sends one 
ruling elder, and Edinburgh two, whose 
election must be attested by the kirk 
sessions of their respective boroughs. 
Every university sends one commission- 
er from its own body. The commission- 
ers are chosen annually six weeks before 
the meeting of the assembly ; and the 
ruling elders are often men of the first 
eminence in the kingdom for rank and 
talents. In this assembly, which meets 
once a year, the king presides by his 
commissioner, who is always a noble- 
man, but he has no voice in their deli- 
berations. The order of their proceed- 
ings is regular, though sometimes the 
number of members ci'eates a confusion ; 
which the moderator, who is chosen 
from among the ministers to be, as it 
were, the speaker of the house, has not 
sufficient authority to prevent. Appeals 
are brought from all the other eccle- 
siastical courts in Scotland to the gene- 
ral assembly; and in questions purely 
religious, no appeal lies from its deter- 
minations. See Hall's View of a Gos- 
/lel Church ; Enc. Brt. art. Presbyte- 
rians; Broiv}i's Vindication of the Pres- 
byterian Form of Church Goverriment;

PRESBYTERIANS, Cumberland, 
this is a body of Presbyterians who prin- 
cipally reside in the states of Kentucky 
and Tennessee, and in the adjacent ter- 
ritories. 

They constituted a presbytery sepa- 
rate from the Kentucky synod and ge- 
neral presbyterian churgh, on the 10th

of February, 1810. The causes that 
led to this are as follow : 

About the year 1799 or 1800, God 
revived religion in a remarkable man- 
ner in the Avestern country, through the 
instrumentality of some presbyterian 
preachers ; consequently, many new 
congi-egations were soon formed and 
organized. But to continue to supply 
them all, by the then licensed and or- 
dained ministers was impracticable. 

A venerable father in the ministry 
who £ame from a distance, discovering 
the necessity for supplies, proposed to 
the preachers who wei'e engaged in 
promoting the revival, to choose from 
amongst the laity some men (whose ta- 
lents, gifts, piety, &amp;c. would justify such 
a step,) and encourage them to prepare 
for the work of the ministry : though 
they might not have a classical educa- 
tion. This proposition was readily ac- 
ceded to, and several persons were 
spoken to on the subject, and encou- 
iTiged to improve their talent by ex- 
hortation, and to prepare written dis- 
courses to exhibit to the next Transyl- 
vania presbytery, as specimens of their 
abilities to sermonize, &amp;c. with which 
they accordingly complied. The dis- 
courses were read to the aged member 
who first recommended the measure, 
and tolerably well approved. They 
were not now received as candidates for 
the ministry, but were directed to pre- 
pare other discourses to read to the next 
presbytery, where the debate became 
very animated, whether they should be 
admitted as candidates for the holy mi- 
nistry ; when finally a majority of one 
vote decided, one of them only should 
be received at that time. The next 
presbytery, however, decided by a large 
majority in favour of the proposed plan ; 
and accordingly, after hearing popular 
trials, &amp;c. proceeded to license three 
men, to wit: — Alexander Anderson, 
Finis Ewing, and Samuel King, to preach 
the Gospel as probationers. These 
men, although two of them had no 
knowledge of the dead languages ; yet 
from their discourses, extempore, as 
well as written, and from the petitions 
of hundreds of serious Christians, pray- 
ing that they might be licensed ; the 
presbytery thou ht they could not be 
out of'^ their duty in promoting them to 
the work of the ministry ; in which 
opinion they were afterwards fully con- 
firmed. Some members of this presby- 
tery, however, as well as the preceding, 
were opposed to the measure, wlio enter- 
ed their protest, and wrote to the synod, 
who, at first, paid but little attention to 
if About this time the Transylvania 



presbytery was divided, and the former, 
Cumberland presbytery, constituted, in 
which there were always a decided ma- 
jority in favour of licensing men to 
preach the Gospel (when need required, 
and God called) who were " apt to 
teach," and sound in the faith, though 
they might not possess a liberal educa- 
tion. Therefore, from time to time 
they licensed, (some of whom they or- 
dained,) men of that description. This 
measure was still opposed by that part 
i of the presbytery who were unfriendly 
to the revival. The synod took the mat- 
ter, and appointed a commission of their 
own body to meet in the bounds of the 
Cumberland presbytery, and directed 
the members thereof, with all their li- 
centiates, candidates, and exhorters, to 
meet ; which summons the greater part 
of them obeyed. After the commission 
and the accused had met, the former 
exhibited many charges against the lat- 
ter; principally taken from the minutes 
of the presbytery and public fame : all 
of which were chiefly comprised in the 
two following, to wit: — 1st, Licensing 
men to preach who had not been ex- 
iUTiined on the languages. 2d, That 
those men who were licensed, both 
learned and less learned, had been only 
required to adopt the confession of 
faith partially, that is, as far as they be- 
lieved it to agree with God's word. 

As to the first ground of complaint, 
the presbytery not only plead the ex- 
ception in the discipline, in " extraordi- 
nary cases," but also the example of a 
number of the presbyteries in different 
parts of the United States. They 
moreover, appealed to a higher autho- 
rity than either of the foregoing, which 
'was the JVew Testameiit, and inquired 
if there be any precept or example in 
that Book which condemns the practice 
of licensing what they (the commission) 
called unlearned men. It was also ask- 
ed, if God could not as easily call a 
Preshytnian not classically learned, to 
preach the Gospel, as he could such of 
anv other denomination ."* 

With respect to doctrines ; the presby- 
tery believed their candidates had de- 
parted from no essential doctrine taught 
in the confession of faith ; and therefore 
ought to have been indulged in their 
conscientious scruples about tenets not 
essential or important. This reasoning, 
however, was not satisfactory to the 
commission, who demanded all the 
young men to be given up to them for 
re-examination. The presbytery re- 
fused ; viewing the demand unprece- 
dented, and directly making dangerous 
encroachments on the liberties and pri- 



PRE

PRE 



vilet^es of presbyteries, who, according 
to the discipline, were sole judges of the 
faitli and qualifications of their own 
candidates for the ministry. The young 
men then being summoned to submit, 
and refiising, the commission proceeded 
solemnly to prohibit them all, learned 
and less learned, from preaching or ad- 
ministering any more as Presbyterians ; 
and summoned the majority of the pres- 
bytery to appear at their next synod, to 
answer for not surrendering their young 
brethren, and to be examined them- 
selves on doctrines. The presbytery 
thought it a very extraordinary step in- 
deed, for a commission of the synod to 
silence, or prohibit, a number of re- 
spectable and useful ministers of Jesus, 
without firocess or trial, men, whose 
moral characters were unexceptionable, 
and who had never been called before 
their own presbytery to answer any 
charge ; and men, who were never con- 
victed of either heresy, imviorality, or 
contumacy, before any judicature what- 
soever. The presbytery being con- 
scious that the commission had acted 
illegally, determined to petition the ge- 
neral assembly. In the mean time they 
formed themselves into a council ; in- 
tending, with their young brethren, to 
promote religion as well as they could in 
that capacity ; refraining from presby- 
terial acts, until they could learn the 
decision of the assembly ; the first de- 
cision of which appeared favourable. 
This encouraged the council to expect 
the assembly would eventually redress 
tlieir grievances. They therefore wait- 
ed and petitioned, until they were con- 
vinced by an act, or decision of the as- 
sembly, that the synod were justified in 
their unconstitutional and unprecedent- 
ed conduct toward the yo\mg preachei's: 
which, (after another fruitless appli- 
cation to the synod and Transylvania 
presbytery) determined thi'ee of the re- 
maining ordained ministers to constitute 
a separate presbytery ; which was done 
in the following manner: 

" In Dickson County, Tennessee State, 
at tlie Rev. S. M'Ad'ow's, this 4th day 
of February, 1810:" 

" We, Samuel M'Adow, Finis Ewing, 
and Samuel King, regularly ordained 
mniistfers in the Presbyterian church, 
against whom no charge either of im- 
morality or heresy has ever been exhi- 
bited, before any church judicatures ; 
having waited in vain more than four 
years ; in the mean time petitioning the 
General Assembly for a redress of 
gi'ievances, and a restoi-ation of our vio- 
lated rights, have, and do hereby agree 
and determine, to constitute a Presby- 



tery, known by the name of the Cum- 
berland Presbytery, on the following 
conditions :" 

All candidates for the ministry who 
may hereafter be licensed by this pres- 
bytery, and all licentiates or probation- 
ers who may hereafter be ordained by 
this presbytery, shall be required be- 
fore such licensure and ordination, to 
receive and adopt the confession and dis- 
cipline* of the presbyterian church, ex- 
cept the idea of fatality that seems to 
be taught under the mysterious doctrine 
of predestination. 

It is to be understood, however, that 
such as can adopt the confession with- 
out such exception, shall not be re- 
quired to make any. Moreover, all 
licentiates, before they are set apart to 
the whole work of the ministry, (or- 
dained) shall be required to undergo an 
examination on English Grammar, Ge- 
ography, Astronomy, natural and mo- 
ral Philosophy, and Church Historj'.t 
The presbytery may also require an ex- 
amination on all or any part of the 
above branches of literature before 
licensure, if they deem it expedient. 

Doctrines. It has been already ob- 
served, that the Presbyterian confession 
is their confession, " except the idea of 
fatality." But as some may think this 
too indefinite, it may be proper here to 
state explicitly all the essential doc- 
trines or tenets they hold. 

1st, I'hat Adam was made upright, 
pure and free; that he was necessarily 
under the moral law, which binds all 
intelligences ; and having transgressed 
it, he was consequently, with all his pos- 
terity, exposed to eternal punishment 
and misery. 

2d, That Christ the second Adam re- 
presented just as many as the first, con- 
sequently made an atonement for all, 
" which will be testified in due time." 
But that the benefit of that atonement 
will be only received by the true believer. 

3d, That all Adam's family are to- 
tally depraved, " conceived in sin ; 
going astray from the womb, and all 
children of wrath ;" therefore must 
" be born again," justified and sancti- 
fied, or thev never can enter into the 
kingdom of God. 

4th, That justification is by faith alone 
as the Instrument ; by the merits of 



* The reception of the disciple is to be nn- 
derstood in conformity to the branches of litt-- 
rature required by this body- 

t It ivill not be understood that exafnination 
on Theo!og:y, experimental reliffion, and a caii 
to the ministry, will be omitted.

Christ's active and passive obedience, 
as the meritorious cause ; and by the 
operation of God's Spirit as the effi- 
cieTit, or active cause. 

5th, That as the sinner is justified on 
the account of Christ's righteousness 
being imputed or accounted to him ; on 
the same account he will be enabled to 
go on fi-om one • degree of grace to 
another, in a progressive life of sanctifi- 
cation, until he is fit to be gathered into 
the gamer of God, who will certainly 
take to glory every man who has been 
really jurtified: that is, he, Christ, has 
become wisdom, (light to convince,) 
righteousness, (to justify) sanctification, 
(to cleanse) and redemption, (to glori- 
fy,) to every truly regenerated soul. 

6th, That there are three persons in 
one God, coequal, essential, and eter- 
nal ; or the Father, Word, and Holy 
Ghost: that the mediator is very God 
and very man ; two distinct natures in 
one person ; therefore while the hu- 
manity obej's and suffers, there is infi- 
nite worth or merit gi^■en to that obe- 
dience and suffering, by the union of the 
di\ inity. 

They dissent from the Confession — 
in, 1st, That there are no eternal repro- 
bates. — 2d, That Christ died not for a 
part only, but for all mankind. — 3d, 
That all infants, dying in infancy are 
saved through Christ, and sanctification 
of the Spirit. — 4th, That the Spirit of 
God operates on the world, or as co-ex- 
tensively as Christ has made the atone- 
ment, in such a manner as to leave all 
men inexcusable. 

As to the doctrines of predestination 
and election, thev think, (with many 
eminent and modest diyines who have 
written on the subject,) they are mys- 
terious, and they are not well pleased 
with the application that rigid Calvin- 
ists, or Arminians m;ike of them. They 
think the truth, or tkaty as well as many 
other points in divinity, lies between the 
opposite extremes. They are confident 
however, that those doctrines should 
not, on the one hand be so construed as 
to make any thing the creature has 
done, or can do, at all meritorious in his 
salvation ; or to lay any grountl to say 
" well done I ;" or to take the least de- 
gree of the honour of our justification 
and perseverance from God's unmeiit- 
ed grace, and Christ's pure righteous- 
ness. On the other hand, they are 
equally confident those doctrines should 
not be so construed as to make God tl e 
author of sin, directly or indirectly ; 
either-of Adam's sin, or any subsequent 
.sin of his fallen race ; or to contradict I 
tiie express and repeated declarations | 



of God's word, on the extent of the 
atonement and operations of the Spirit; 
or to contradict the sincerity of God's 
expostulations with sinners, and make 
his oath to have no meaning, when he 
swears he has no pleasure in their 
death ; or to resolve the whole charac- 
ter of the Deity into his sovereignty, 
without a due regard to all other of his 
adorable attributes. Finally, they think 
those doctrines ought to be thought and 
spoken of in a consistency with God's 
moi-al government, which always has for 
its object the happiness of his intelligent 
creatures, when it consists with his jus- 
tice and the honour of the divine throne. 

Discipline. Their discipline is Pres- 
byterian. Their congregations are go- 
verned by church sessions, presbyte- 
ries, and they now have appointed to 
constitute a synod to be called the Cum- 
berland Svnod. They are tenacious of 
the presLyterial form of church go- 
vernment ; because they believe it to be 
equitable, just, and scriptural ; and be- 
cause it tends to cherish in their minds, 
and the minds of their congregations, a 
love of civil, as well as religious liber- 
ty ; its being so congenial to the repub- 
lican form of gov(.;inment established 
in these United Slates; which stands 
equally aloof from monarchy and anar- 
chy. 

On the subject of their deviation from 
the old rule with respect to literarj' qua- 
lification for the ministry, they would 
not be understood as undervaluing that 
precious handmaid to the useful work 
of a Gospel minister. They have in 
two publications called " a circular 
letter," and " a reply," given abundant 
evidence of their anxiety to acquire and 
promote useful knowledge ; by recom- 
mending the study of the Greek scrip- 
tures, and by their exertion to procure 
a circulating library of theological, his- 
torical, and scientific books, w hich thej- 
are increasing from time to time. Not- 
withstanding they are persuaded that 
Ciod has and does call many to pi-each 
the Gospel, who have no knowledge of 
the original languages, and who have 
been and are eminently useful in their 
profession. They have therefore dis- 
pensed with that condition, as not being 
absolutely necessaiy ; yet they recom- 
mend it, when it can conveniently be 
acquired. From pursuing this course 
they have, as might be expected, sqme 
learned and sume less learned preach- 
ers of the eA'erlasting Gospel : the lat- 
ter of whom appear in many instances, 
to be as useful m promoting the word 
of God as liie former. 
Progress. Since they first constituted 



PRE 



489 



PRE 



a separate presbytery they have made 
considerable jjro'gress. At tirst there 
were but nine preachers in the connec- 
tion, four of- whom only were ordained. 

At that time their organized congre- 
gations were but few ; but since, they 
have increased to about eighty, exclu- 
sive of a number not yet organized. 
Their preachers have increased from 
nine to eighteen, fourteen of whom ai'e 
ordained ; and there are now about ten 
candidates for the ministiy. At their 
stated session in April 1813, they di- 
vided their body into three presbyte- 
ries, and appointed to con';':itute a synod 
on the first Wednesday in October fol- 
lowing. They have pursued the itine- 
rant mode of preaching the Gospel, 
which appears to ha.ve a good effect, 
and to be the best in a frontier country. 
The demand for preaching, however, is 
increasing faster than their preachers. 

They continue to obsen'e a custom 
which was introduced early in the glo- 
lious revival in that countiy, which is, 
to encamp on the gi-ound at their com- 
munion for four days and nights : . and 
it has been remarked that they have 
rarely had a communion since they con- 
stituted, but more or less have given sa- 
tisfactory evidence of having become 
subjects of vital religion. Sometimes, 
howevi^r, there are but few, at other 
times, there are as many as thirty or 
forty, who have made a crediljle pro- 
fession of faith in the Lord Jesus. A 
gi-eat part of their increase consists of 
new converts, whose lives and conver- 
sation manifest " they have been with 
Jesus." 

While God thus evidently owns their 
Immble efforts to spread a savour of 
his name, they hope to bear With firm- , 
ness all the opposition they may meet, 
from individuals or sectaries. 

P. S. When they receive candidates 
for the ministry, they allow them to ex- 
ercise their gift in public speaking, un- 
der the immediate eye of the church ; 
thereby they are better able to judge of 
their " aptness to teach," than they 
could be by their written discourses 
alone, which thev require also. 

PRESBYTERIANS ENGLISH. 
The appellation Presbyterian in England 
is appropriated to a body of dissenters, 
who have not any attachment to the 
Scotch mode of church government any 
more than to episcopacy among us; and 
therefore the term Presbyterian is here 
improperly applied. How this misap- 
plication came to pass cannot be easily 
determined ; but it has occasioned many 
wrong notions, and should therefore be 
rectified. English Presbyterians, as 



they are called, adc^pt nearly the same 
mode of church gofcfcrnmcnt with the 
Independents. Their chief difference 
from the Independents is, that they are 
less attached to Calvinism. 

PRESBYTERY REFORMED.— 
The reformed presbytery in Scotland 
trace their origin as far back as the re- 
formation, and consider themselves, as 
the only pure Presbyterians since the 
revolution. They profess to adhere to 
the solemn league and covenant agreed 
to by the nation before the restoration, 
in which they abjure popery and pre- 
lacy, and resolve to maintain and de- 
fend the doctrines, worship, discipline, 
and government of tlie church, as ap- 
proved by the parliament and assembly 
at Westminster, and by the general as- 
sembly of the church and parliament of 
Scotland, 1645-9. It seems, they object 
not so much to a religious establishment, 
but to the religious establishment as it 
exists ; they object not to an alliance of 
the church with the state, but to the al- 
liance of the church with an uncovenant- 
ed king and government. Their num- 
ber, it is said, amounts to about four 
thousand persons. 

PRESCIENCE OF GOD, is his fore- 
knowledge, or that knowledge which 
God has of things to come. The doc- 
trine of predestination is founded oq. 
the prescience of God, and on the sup- 
position of all futurity being present to 
him. Properly speaking, indeed, pre- 
science follows that of predestination ; 
for if we allow that God from all eter- 
nity foresaw all things, he must thus 
ha\'e foreseen them in consequence of 
his permitting or fore-appointing them. 
Hence events are not certain merely be- 
cause foreknown ; but foreknown be- 
cause antecedently certain on account 
of pre-determining reasons. See Fore- 
knowledge, Predestination. 

PRESCRIPTION, in theology, was 
a kind of argument pleaded By Tertul- 
lian and others in the third century 
against erroneous doctors. This mode 
of arguing has lieen despised by some, 
both because it has been used by Pa- 
pists, and because they think that trath 
has no need of such a support'. Others, 
however, think that if it can be shown 
that any particular doctrine of Chris- 
tianity was held in the earliest ages, 
even approaching the apostolic, it must 
ha\e very considerable weight ; and, in- 
deed, that it has so, appears from the 
universal appeals of all parties to those 
early times in support of their particular 
opinions. Besides, the thing is in itself 
natuTal i for if a man finds a variety of 
opiaiions in the world upon impoitant

passages in Sci ijttiirc, wlicrc shall lie 
be so apt to get the true sense as from 
contemporary writers or others who 
lived very near the apostolic age * And 
if such a man shall find any doctrine or 
interpretations to have been universally 
believed in the first ages, or, as Vicentius 
Lirinensis words it, sem/ier ubique et ab 
omnibus, he will unquestionably be dis- 
posed to think such early and universal 
consent, or such prescription, of very 
•considerable weiglit in determining his 
opinion. 

PRESUMPTION, as it relates to the 
mind, is a supposition formed before ex- 
amination. As it relates to the conduct 
or moral action, it implies arrogance 
and irreverence. As it relates to reli- 
gion in general, it is a bold and daring 
confidence in the goodness of God, with- 
out obedience to h'is will. Prvsumptuoua 
sins must be distinguished from sins of 
infirmity, or those failings peculiar to 
human "nature, Ecc. vii. 20. 1 John i. &lt;S, 
9; froni sins done through ignorance, 
Luke xii. 48 : and from sins iiito which 
men are hurried by sudden and \'iolent 
temptation, Gal. vi. 1. The ingredients 
which render sin presumptuous are, 
knowledge, John, xv. 22; deliberation 
and contrivance, Prov. vi. 14. Psal. 
xxxvi. 4 ; obstinacy, .Ter. xliv. 16. Deut! 
i. 13 ; inattention to the remonstrances 
of conscience, yVcts, vii. 51; opposition 
to the dispensations of Providence, 2 
Chron. xxviii. 22 ; and repeated com- 
mission of the same sin, I'sal. Ixxx-iii. 
\7. Presumptuous sins are numerous ; 
such as profane swearing, perjurv, theft, 
adultery, drunkenness, sab!)ath-break - 
ing, &amp;c. These may be more ])articu- 
lai'ly considered as presumptuous sins, 
because they are generally corrimitted 
against a known law, and so often- re- 
peated. Such sins are most heinous in 
their nature, and most pernicious in 
their effects. They are said to be a 
reproach' to the Lord, Numb. xv. 3 ; 
they harden the heart, 1 Tim. iv. 2; 
draw down judgments from heaven. 
Numb. XV. 31 ; even when repented of, 
ai'c seldom pardoned without some vi- 
sible testimony of God's displeasure, 2 
Sam. xii.' 10. As it respects professors 
of religion, as one observes, they sin 
presumptuouslv, 1. when they take up 
a profession of religion without princi- 
ple ; 2. when they* profess to ask the 
blessing of God, and yet go on in for- 
bidden courses; 3. when they do. not 
take religion as they find it in the Scrip- 
tures ; 4. when they make their feel- 
ings the test of their religion, without 
considering the difference between ani- |i 
mal passions and the operations of the l| 



Spiiit of God ; 5. when they run into 
temptation ; 6. when they indulge in 
selt-confidence and self-complacency ; 
7. when they bring the •spirit of the 
world into the church; 8. when they 
form apologies foi- that in some which 
they condemn in others ; 9. when pro- 
fessing to believe in tiie doctrines of the 
Gospel, they live licentiously; 10. when 
they create, magnify, and pervert their 
troubles ; 1 1 . when they ai'raign the con- 
duct of God as unkind and unjust. See

PRIDE is inordinate and unreasonable 
self-esteem, attended with insolence, 
and rjide treatment of others. " It is 
sometimes," says a good writer, " con- 
founded with vanity, and sometimes 
with dignity ; but to the former passion 
it has no resemblance, and in many cii-- 
cumstances it differs from the latter. 
Vanitv is the parent of loquacious 
boasting ; and the person subject to it, 
if his pretences be admitted, has no in- 
clination to insult the company. The 
proud man, on the other hand, is na- 
tui-ally silent, and, wrapt up in his own 
importance, seldom speaks but to make 
his audience feel their inferiority." 
Pride is the high opinion that a poor lit- 
tle contracted soul entertains of itself. 
Dignity consists in just, great, and uni- 
form actions, and is the opposite to 
meanness. — 2. Pride manifests itself by 
praising ourselves, adorning our per- 
sons, attempting to appear before others 
in a superior light to what we are ; con- 
tempt and slander of others; envy at 
the excellencies others possess ; anxiety 
to gain applause ; distress and rage 
when slighted ; impatience of contra- 
diction, and opposition to God himself. 
— 3. The evil effects of pride are beyond 
computation. It has spread itself uni- 
versally in all nations, among all cha- 
racters ; and as it was the fii'st sin, as 
some suppose, that entered into the 
world, so it seems the last to be con- 
quered. It may be considered as the 
parent Of discontent, ingratitude, covet- 
ousness, poverty, presumption, passion, 
extravagance, bigotry, war, and perse- 
cution. In fact, there is hardly an evil 
perpetrated but what pride is connected 
with it in a proximate or remote sense. 
— 4. To suppress this evil, we should 
consider what we are. " If we could 
trace our descents," says Seneca, " we 
should find all slaves to come from

{)rmces, and all princes from slaves. To 
)e proud of knowledge, is to be blind in 
the light ; to be proud of virtue, is to 

Eoison ourselves with the antidote ; to 
e proud of authority, is to make our 
rise our downfall." The imperfection of 
our nature, our scanty knowledge, con- 
tracted powers, narrow conceptions, 
and moral inability, are strong motives 
to excite us to humility. We should con- 
sider also, what punishment this sin lias 
brought on mankind. See the cases of 
Pharaoh, Haman, Nebuchadnezzar, 
Herod, and others. How particularly 
it is proliibited, Prov. xvi. 18. 1 Pet. v. 
5. James iv. 6. Prov. xxix. 23 ; what a 
torment it is to its possessor, Esther v. 
13 ; how soon all things of a sublunary 
nature will end'; how disgraceful it ren- 
ders us in the sight of God, angels, and 
men ; what a barrier it is to our felicity 
and communion with God ; how fruit- 
ful it is of discord ; how it precludes 
our usefulness, and renders us really 
conteriiptible. See Humility. 
PRIEST, a person set apart for the 

Eerformance of sacrifice, and other of- 
ces and ceremonies of religion. Before 
the promulgation of the law of Moses, 
the first-born of every family, tlie fa- 
thers, tlxe princes, and the kings, were 
priests. Thus Cain and Abel, Noah, 
Abraham, Melchizedec, Job, Isaac, and 
Jacob, offered themsch es their own sa- 
crifices. Among tlie Israelites, after 
their departure from Egypt, the priest- 
liood was confined to one tribe, and it 
consisted of three orders, the high- 
pricat, priests, and Levites. The priest- 
hood was made hereditary in the family 
of Aaron ; and the first-born of the old- 
est branch qf that family, if he had no 
legal blemish, was always the higli- 
priest. Tliis divine appointment was 
observed witli considerable accuracy 
till the Jews fell under the dominion of 
the Romans, and had their faitli cor- 
rupted by a false pliilosopliy. Then, 
indeed, the high-priesthood Avas some- 
times set up to sale, and, instead of con- 
tinuing for life, as .it ought to have done, 
it seems, from some passages in the 
New Testament, to have been nothing 
more than an annual office. There is 
sufficient reason, howevei', to believe, 
that it was never disposed of but to 
some descendant of Aaron capable of 
filling it, liad tlie older l^ranches been 
extinct. [For the consecration and of- 
fices of the Jewish priesthood, we refer 
our readers to the books of Moses.] In 
the time of 'David, the inferior priests 
were divided into twenty-four compa- 
nies, who were to sei-\'e in rotation, each 
company by itself, for a week. I'lie or- 



der in which the several courses were 
to serve was determined by lot ; and 
each course was, in all succeeding ages, 
called by the name of its original chief 

It has been much disputed, whetlier 
in the Christian churcli there be any 
such officer as a priest, in tlie proper 
sense of the word. If tlie word priest 
be taken to denote a person commis- 
sioned by divine authority to offer up a 
real sacrifice to God, we may justly de- 
nv that there is a priest upon earth. 
Under the Gospel, there is but one 
priest,- which is Christ : and but one sa- 
crifice, tliat of the cross. The church 
of Rome, however, erroneously believe 
their priests to be empowered to offer 
up to the Divine Majesty a real proper 
sacrifice, as were the priests under the 
Old Testament. Ecclesiastical history 
informs us that, in tlie second century, 
some time after the reign of the em- 
peror Adrian, wlien the Jews, by the 
second destruction of Jerusalem, were 
bereaved of all hopes of the restoration 
of tlieir government to its former lustre, 
the notion that the ministers of the 
Christian church succeeded to the cha- 
racter and prerogati\es of the Jewish 
priesthood, was industriously propaga- 
ted by the Christian doctors; and that, 
in conseciuence, the bishops claimed a 
rank and character similar to that of 
tlie Jewish high-priest ; the presbyters 
to that of the priests ; and the deacons 
to tliat of the Levites. One of the per- 
nicious effVicts of this groundless com- 
parison and pretfiision seems to have 
been, the introduction of the idea of a 
real sacrifice in the Ciiristian church, 
and of sacrificing priests. 

In the cliurcii of England, the word 
priest is retained to denote the second 
order in her hierarchy, but we believe 
with very different significations, ac- 
cording to the different ojiinions enter- 
tained of tlie Lord's supper. Some few 
of lier divines, of great learning, and of 
undoubted protestantism, mahitain that 
the Lord's sup]ier is a commemorative 
and euchuristical sacrijice. Tliese con- 
sider all who are autliorized to admi- 
nister that sacrament as in the strictest 
sense priests. Others hold the Lord's 
su])i)er to be a feast upon the one sa- 
crifice, once oileied on the cross ; and 
these, too, must consider themselves as 
clothed with some kind of priestliood. 
Great numbers, however, ot the Engr- 
lish clergy, perhaps the majority, agree 
with the cliurch of Scothuid, in main- 
taining that the Lord's su])])er is a rite 
of no other moral import tlian the mere 
commemoration of the death oi Christ. 
These cannot consider themselves as 



PRI 



492 



PRI 



ftriests in the rigid sense of the word, 
but only as presbyters, of which the 
word priest is a contraction of tlie 
same import with elder. See Lord's 
Supper. 

PRIMACY, the highest post in the 
church. The Romanists contend that 
St. Peter, by our Lord's, appointment, 
had a primacy of sovereign authority 
and jurisdiction over the apostles. This, 
however, is denied by the Protestants, 
and that upon just grounds. Dr. Bar- 
j'ow observes, (Works, vol. i. p. 557,^ 
that there are several sorts of primacy 
^vhich may belong to a person in re- 
spect of others. 1. A pi'imacy of worth 
or pei'sonal excellency. — 2. A primacy 
of reputation and esteem. — 3. A pri- 
macy of order or bare, dignity and pre- 
cedence. — 4. A primacy of power and 
jurisdiction. As for the first of these, a 
primacy of worth, we may well grant it 
to Peter, admitting that probably, he did 
exceed the i-est of his brethren in per- 
sonal endowments and capacities ; par- 
ticularly in quickness of apprehension, 
boldness of spirit, readiness of speech, 
charity to our Lord, and zeal for his 
service. — 2. As to the primacy of re- 
pute, which St. Paul means when he 
speaks of those who had a special re- 

fmtation, of those who seemed to be pil- 
ars, of the supereminent apostles. Gal. 
ii. 6, 9. 2 Cor. xi. 5. xii. 11. this advan- 
tage cannot be refused him, being a ne- 
cessary consequent of those eminent 
qualities resplendent in him, and of the 
illustrious performances achieved by 
him beyond the rest. This may be in- 
ferred from that renown which he hath 
had from the beginning ; and likewise 
from his being so constantly ranked in 
t he first place before the rest of his 
i^rethi-en. — 3. As to a primacy of order 
»jr bare dignity, importing that common- 
ly in all meetings and proceedings, the 
other apostles did yield him the prece- 
dence, may be questioned ; for this does 
not seem si^itable to the gi-avity of such 
persons, of their condition and circum- 
stances, to stand upon ceremonies of re- 
spect ; for our Lord's rules seem to ex- 
clude all semblance of ambition, all 
kind of inequality and distance between 
his apostles. Rut yet this primacy may 
tie granted as probable upon divers ac- 
coimts of use and convenience ; it might 
be useful to preserve order, and to pro- 
mote expedition, or to prevent confu- 
sion, distraction, and dilatory olistruction 
in the management of things. — 4. As to 
a primacy importing a superiority in 
command, power or jurisdiction, this- 
we have great reason to deny a])on the 
following considerations. 1. For such a 



power it was needful that a commission 
from God, its founder, should be grant- 
ed in absolute and perspicuous tenns j 
but no such commission is extant in 
Scripture. — 2. If so illustrious an office 
was instituted by our Saviour, it is 
strange, that no Avhere in the evangeli- 
cal or apostolical history there should be 
any express mention of that institution. 
—3. If St. Peter had been instituted 
sovereign of the apostolical senate, his 
office and state had been in nature and 
kind very distinct from the common of- 
fice of the other apostles, as the office of 
a king from the office of any subject; 
and probably would have been signified 
by some distinct name, as that of arch- 
apostle, arch-pastor, the Vicar of Christ, 
or the like ; but no such name or title 
was assumed by him, or was by the rest 
attributed to him. — 4. There was no of- 
fice above that of an apostle, known to 
the apostles or primitive church, Eph. 
iv. 11. 1 Cor. xii. 28.-5. Our Lord 
himself declared against this kind of 
primacy, prol\ibiting his apostles to af- 
fect, to seek, to assume, or admit a su- 
Eeriority of power One above another, 
-uke xxii. 14—24. Mark ix. 35.-6. 
We do not find any peculiar, adminis- 
tration committed to St. Peter, nor any 
privilege conferred on him which was 
not also granted to the other apostles, 
John XX. 23. Mark xvi. 15.— 7. When 
Peter wrote two catholic epistles, there 
does not appear in either of them any 
intimation or any pretence to this arch- 
apostolical power. — 8. In all relations 
which occur in Scripture about contro- 
versies incident of doctrine or practice, 
there is no appeal made to St. Peter's 
judgment or allegation of it as decisive, 
no argument is built on his authority. — 

9. St. Peter no. where appears inter- 
meddling as a judge or govenior para- 
mount in such cases ; yet where he doth 
himself deal with heretics and disorder- 
ly persons, he proceedeth not as a pope 
decreeing ; but as an apostle, warning, 
arguing and persuading against them. — ■ 

10. The consideration of the apo,stles 
proceeding in the conversion of people, 
m the foundation of churches, and in 
administration of their spiritual affairs, 
will exclude any probability of St. Pe- 
ter's jurisdiction over them. They went 
about their busiuQss, not by order or li- 
cence from St. Peter, but, according to 
special direction of God's Spirit. — 11. 
The nature of the apostolic ministry, 
their not being fixed in one place of re- 
sidence, but continually moving about 
the world ; the state of things at that 
time, and the manner of St. Peter's life, 
render it unlikely that he had. such a 



PRI 



493 



PRO 



Jiivisdiction over the apostles as some 
assign him. — 12, It was indeed most re- 
quisite that every apostle should have 
a complete, absolute, independent au- 
thority in managing the duties and con- 
cerns of- the office, that he might not 
any wise be obstructed in the discharge 
of them, not clogged with a need to con- 
sult others, not hampered with ordei-^ 
from those who were at a distance. — 13. 
The discourse and behaviour of St. Paul 
towards St. Peter doth evidence that he 
did not acknowledge any dependence on 
him, or any subjection to him, (ial. ii.* 
11. — 14. If St. Peter had been appoint- 
ed sovereign of the church, it seems 
that it should have been requisite that 
he should have outlived all the apostles; 
for othei'wise, the church would have 
wanted a head, or there must have been 
an inextricable controversy who that 
head was. But St. Peter died long be- 
fore St. John, as all agree, and perhaps 
before divers others of the apostles. 

From- these arguments we must evi- 
dently see what little ^'ound the church 
of Rome hath to derive the supremacy 
of the hope from the supposed primacy 
of St. Peter. 

PRIMATE, an archbishop who is in- 
vested with a jurisdiction over other bi- 
shops. See Archbishop. 

PRIMITIVE CHRISTIANS, those 
who lived in the first ages of Christianity, 
especially the apostles and immediate 
followers of our Lord. 

PRINCIPLE, an essential truth from 
which others are derived : the ground 
or motive of action. See Disposition 
and Doctrine. 

PRIOR, the head of a convent ; next 
in dignity to an abbot. 

PRISCILLIANISTS, the followers 
of Priscillian, in the fourth century. It 
appears ft-om authentic records, that 
the difference between their doctrine 
and that of the Manicheans was not 
very considerable. For they denied the 
reality of Christ's birth and incarnation ; 
maintained that the visible universe 
Avas not the production of the Supreme 
Deity, but of some dsmon or malignant 
l)rinciple ; adopted the doctrines of 
ccqns, or emanations from the divine na- 
ture ; considered human bodies as pri- 
sons formed by the author of evil to en- 
slave celestial minds ; condemned mar- 
riage, and disbelieved the resurrection 
of the body. Their rule of life and 
manners was rigid and severe ; the ac- 
counts, therefoi-e, which many have 
given of their lasciviousness and intem- 
perance deserve not the least credit, as 
they are totally destitute of evidence and 
authority. Tliat the Priscillianists were 



guilty of dissimulation upon some occa- 
sions, and deceived their adversaries by 
cunning stratagems, is ti-ue ; but that 
they held, it as a maxim, that lying and 
perjury were lawful, is a most notorious 
falsehood, witliout even the least shadow 
of probability. 

PROBITY, honesty, sincerity, or ve- 
racity. " It consists in the habit of ac- 
tions useful to society, and in the con- 
stant observance of the laws which jus- 
tice and conscience impose upon us. . 
The man who obeys all the laws of so- 
ciety with an exact punctuality, is not, 
therefore, a man of probity : laws can 
only respect the external and definite 
parts of human conduct ; but probity 
respects our more private actions, and 
such as it is impossible in all cases to 
define ; and it appears to be in morals 
what charity is in religion. Probity 
teaches us to perform in society those 
actions which no external power can 
oblige us to pei-form, and is that quality 
in the human mind from which we claim 
the performance of the rights common- 
ly called imjierftct." 

PROCESSION, a ceremony in the 
Romish church, consisting of a formal 
march of the clergy and people, putting 
up prayers, &amp;c. and in this manner vi- 
siting some church, &amp;c. They have 
processions of the hont or sacrament : 
of our Saxnour to mount Calvary; of 
the Bosary, &amp;c. 

Processions are said to be of Pagan 
original. The Romans, when the em- 
pire was distressed, or after some vic- 
tory, used constantly to order proces- 
sions, for several days together, to be 
made to the temples, to beg the assis- 
tance of the gods, or to return them 
thanks. 

The first processions mentioned in ec- 
clesiastical history, are th&lt;?se set on foot 
at Constantinople, by St. Chrysostom 
The Arians of that city, being forced to 
hold their meetings without the town, 
went thither night and morning, singing 
anthems. Chrysostom, to prevent their 
perverting the Catholics, set up coun- 
ter-processions, in which the clergy and 
people marched by night, singing pray- 
ers and hymns, and carrying crosses and 
flambeaux. From this peViod the cus- 
tom of processions was introduced 
among the Greeks, and afterwards 
among the Latins; but they have 
subsisted longer, and been more fre- 
quently used in the Western than in 
the Eastern church. 

PROCESSION OF THE HOLY 
GHOST, a term made use of in refei-- 
ence to the Holy Ghost, as proceeding , 
from the Father, or from the Father 



PRO 



494 



PRO 



and the Son. It seems to be founded on 
that passage in John xv. 26. " When 
the Comforter is come, whom I will 
send imto you from the Father, even 
the Spirit of Truth which firoceedeth 
from the Father, He shall testify of me." 
The procession of the Holy Ghost, it is 
said, is expressly taught by Chi'ist, in 
very strong terms, in this text. This 
procession, it is alleged, is here evi- 
dently distinguished from his mission ; 
for it is said, "Whom I will se7id to you 
from the Father, even the Spirit of 
Truth, \jh\c)\ p7-occeds from the Father." 
If his mission and proceeding were the 
same thing, thfere would be a tautology 
in the words, his mission, according to 
that interpretation, being mentioned 
twice in the same verse. Dr. Watts, 
however, ol)serves, that the procession 
of the Holy Ghost fi-om the Father, re- 
spects not his nature or substance, but 
his mission only ; and that no distinct 
and clear ideas can be formed of this 
procession ; consequently it must be 
given up as popish, scholastic, incon- 
ceivable, and imlefensible. But, it is 
answered, what clear idea can be given 
us of the originate, self-existent, eternal 
being of the Father :* Sliall we, there- 
fore, deny him to be without beginning 
or end, and to be self-existent, because 
"we know not how he is so ? If not, why 
must we give up -tlie procession of tlie 
Spirit, because we know not the mode 
of it. We can no more explain the man- 
ner how the Spirit proceeds from the 
Father, than we can explain the eternal 
generation and hypostatical union of the 
two natures of the Son. We may say 
to the objector, as Gregory Nazianzen 
formerly did to his adversary, " Do you 
tell me how the Father is unbegotten, 
■and I will attempt to tell you how the 
Son is begotten, and the Spirit pro- 
ceeds." 

The clearest and fullest account of 
this procession, next to that in the 
above-mentioned text, is that in 1 Cor. 
ii. 12. " The Spirit which is of God ;" 
that is (say the advocates for this doc- 
trine,) the Spirit which is the same in 
nature and essence with the Fatlier, and 
so is said to be of \\\\xt, or out of him, not 
as to local separation, but with respect 
to identity of nature. 

About the eighth and ninth centuries 
there was a very warm dispute between 
the Greek and Latin churches, wl\ether 
the Spirit proceeded from the Father 
only, or from the Father and the Son ; 
and the controversy arose to such a 
height, that they charged one another 
with heresy and schism, when neither 
side well understood what the\- contend- 



ed for. The Latin church, however, 
has not scrupled to say that the Spirit 
proceeds from the Father and the Son ; 
but the Greek church chooses to ex- 
press it thus : the Spirit proceeds from 
the Father by or through the Son, or he 
receives of the Son, Gal. iv. 6. See 
Holy Ghost ; Bishop Pearson on the 
preec/, p. 324; Watts's Works, 8vo. ed. 
vol. V. p. 199 ; Hurrion on the Holy 
Spirit, p. 204; Ridgley's Div. qu. 11; 
Br. Liffhffoot's Works, vol. i. p. 482. 

PROFANE, a term used in opposi- 
tion to /jcj/j/; and in general is applied 
to all persons who have not the sacred 
character, and to things which do not 
belong to the service of religion. 

PROFESSION, among the Roman- 
ists, denotes the entering into a religious 
order, whereby a person offers himself 
to God by a vow of inviolably observing • 
obedience, chastity, and poverty. 

Christians are required to make a 
profession of their faith, 1. Boldly, Rom. 
i. 16.— 2. Explicitly, Matt. v. -16.— 3. 
Constantly, Heb. x. 23. — 4. Yet not os- 
tentatiously, but with humility and 
meekness. 

PROFESSOR, a term comtnonly 
used in the religious world, to denote 
any person who makes an open acknow- 
ledgment of the religion of Christ, or 
who cxitwardly manifests his .attach- 
ment to Christianity. All real Chris- 
tians are professors, but all professors 
are not real Christians. In this, as in 
all other things of worth and impor- 
tance, we find counterfeits. There are 
many who become professors, not from 
principle, from investigation, from love 
to the truth ; but from interested mo- 
tives, pi-ejudice of education, custom, 
influence of connections, no\elty, &amp;c. as 
Saul, Jehu, Judas, Demas, the foolish 
virgins, &amp;c. See article Christian :

Christian; Bellamy's True Religion de- 
lineated; Shepherd's Sincere Convert,' 
and on the Parable of the Ten Vir- 
gins ; Seeker's A'onsnch Professor. 

PROMISE is a solemn asseveration, 
by which one pledges his veracity that 
he shall perform, or cause to be per- 
formed, the thing which he mentions. 

The obligatioj) of promises arises from 
the necessity of the wel!-l)eing and ex- 
istence of society. " Virtue requires," 
as Dr. Doddridge observes, " that pro- 
mises be fulfilled. The promisee, i. e. 
the person to whom the promise is 
made, acquires a property in virtue of 
the promise. The uncertainty of pro- 
perty would evidently be attended with 
great inconvenience. By failing to ful- 
fil my promise, I either show that I was 



PRO 



495 



PRO 



not sincere in makins? it, or that I have 
little constancy or resolution, and either 
•\vay injure my character, and conse- 
quently my usefolness in life. Promises, 
however, are not binding, 1. If they 
were made by us before we came to 
such exercise of reason as to be fit to 
transact affairs of moment ; or if by any 
distemper or sudden sui'^^rise we -are de- 
prived of the exercise of our reason at 
the time when the promise is made. — 

2. If the promise was made on a false 
presumption, in which the promiser, af- 
ter the most diligent inquiry, was im- 
posed upon, especiallv if^ he were de- 
ceived by the fraud of the promisee. — 

3. If the thing itself be vicious ; for vir- 
tue cannot require that vice shotild be 
committed. — 4. If the accomplishment 
of the promise be so hard and intolera- 
ble, that there is reason to believe that, 
had it been foreseen, it would have been 
an excepted case. — 5. If the promise be 
not accepted, or if it depend on condi- 
tions not performed." See Doddridg-e's 
Lee. lee. 69 ; Grot, de Jure, lib. ii. cap. 
1 1 ; Faley's Mor. Phil. ch. 5, vol. i. ; 
Grove's Mor. Phil. vol. ii. p. 2, c. 12 ; 
Jf'atts's Ser. ser. 20. 

PROMISES OF GOD are the kind 
declarations of his word, in which he 
hath assured us he will bestow blessings 
upon his people. The promises con- 
tained in the sacred Scriptures may be 
considered, 1. Divine as to their origin. — • 
2. Suitable as to their nature. — 3. Abun- 
dant as to tlieir numlier. — 4. Clear as to 
their expression. — 5. Certain as to their 
accomplishment. The consideration of 
them should, 1. Prove an antidote to 
despair. — 2. A motive to patience. — 3. 
A call for prayer. — 4. A spur to perse- 
verance. See Clark on the Promises, a 
book that Dr. Watts says, "he could 
djare put into the hands of every Chris- 
tian, among all their divided sects and 
parties in the world." Buck's Serm. 
ser. xi. 

PROPHECY, a word derived from 
?rj-(pn?Eia, and in its original import signi- 
fies the prediction of future events. It 
is thus defined by Witsius : " A know- 
ledge and manifestation of seci'et things, 
which a man knows not fi-om his own 
sagacity, noi- from the relation of others, 
but by an extraordinary revelation of 
God from heaven." In the Old and 
New Testaments the word is not al- 
ways confined to the foretelling of fu- 
ture events. In several instances it is 
of the same import with preaching, and 
denotes the faculty of illustrating and 
applying to present practical purposes 
the doctrines of prioi- revelation. Thus, 
in Nehemiah it js said, " Thou hast ap- 



pointed prophets to prea'ch," ch. vi; 
ver. 7; and whoever speaketh unto men 
to edification, and exhortation, and com- 
fort, is by St. Paul called a prophet, 
1 Cor. xiv. 3. HAfice it was that there 
were schools of prophets in Israel, where 
young men were instructed in the truths 
of religion, and fitted to exhort and com- 
fort tiie people. It is prophecy, how- 
ever, according to the first definition 
given abo\e, Ave shall here consider. 

Prophecy (with the power of work- 
ing miracles) may be considered as the 
highest evidence that can be given of a 
supernatural communion with the Deity. 
Hence, among the professors of almost 
eveiy religious system, there have been 
numberless pretenders to the gift of 
prophecy. Pagans had their oracleg, 
augurs, and soothsayers ; modern idola- 
ters their necromancers and diviners; 
and the Jews, Christians, and Mahome- 
tans, their 'prophets. The pretensions 
of Pagans and impostors, have, how- 
ever, been justly exposed ; while the 
Jewish and Christian pi-ophecies carry 
with them evident niark^s of their va- 
lidity. Hence St. Peter observes, " Wq 
have a more sure word of prophecy, 
whereunto we do well to take heed, as 
unto a light that shineth in a dark place ; 
for the prophecy came not in old time 
by the Avill of man, but holy men of God 
spake as'thev were moved by the Holv 
Ghost." 2 'Pet. ii. 19, 21. Scripture 
■prophecy, therefore, hath God for its 
origin. It did not arise from the genius 
of the mind, the temperarnent of the 
body, the influence of the' stars, &amp;:c. 
but from the sovereign will of God. The 
ways by which the i)eity made known 
his mind were various; such as b}' 
dreams, visions, angels, symbolic repre- 
sentations, impulses on the mind, Numb. 
xii. 6. Jer. xxxi, 26. Dan. viii. 16, 17 

As to the language of prophecy : " It 
is," says Mr. Grav, "remarkable for 
its magnificence. lEach prophetic wri- 
ter is distinguished for peculiar bean- 
ties ; but their style in general may be 
characterised as strong, animated, and 
imjjressive. Its ornaments are derived 
not from accumulation of epithet, or la- 
boured harmony; but from the rei\ 
grandeur of its images, and the majestic 
force of its expressions. It is varied 
with -striking propriety, and enlivened 
with qiiick but easy transitions. Its sud- 
den bursts of eloquence, its earnest 
warmth, its affecting exhortations aad 
appeals, affords very interesting proofs 
of that lively impvession, and of that in- 
spired conviction, under which t)ie pro- 
phets wrote ; and which enabled them, 
among a people not distinguished for

genius, to surpass, in every variety of 
composition, the most admired produc- 
tions of Paj^an antiquity. If the imagery 
employed i)v the sacred writers appears 
sometimes to partafee of a coarse and 
indelicate cast, it must be recollected, 
that the Eastern manners and languages 
required the most forcible representa- 
tions ; and that the masculine and in- 
dignant spirit of the prophets led them 
to adopt the most energetic and descrip- 
tive expressions. No style is, perhaps, 
so highly figui-ative as that of the pro- 
phets. Every object of nature and of 
art which could furnish allusions is ex- 
plored with industiT .; every scene of 
creation, and every' page of science, 
seems to have unfolded its rich varieties 
to the sacred writers, who, in the spirit 
of Easteni. poetry, delight in every kind 
of metaphorical embellishment. Thus, 
by way of illustration, it is obvious to re- 
mark, that earthly dignities- and powers 
are symbolized by the celestial bodies ; 
the effects of moral evil are shown un- 
der the storms and convulsions of na- 
ture ; the pollutions of sin are repre- 
sented by external impurities ; and the 
beneficial influence of righteousness is 
depicted by the serenity and confidence 
of peaceful life. This allegorical lan- 
guage, being founded in ideas univer- 
sally prevalent, and adhered to with in- 
variable relation and regular analogy, 
has furnished great ornament and ele- 
gance to the sacred writings. Some- 
times, however, the inspired penmen 
drew their allusions from local and tem- 
l)orary soarces of metaphor ; from the 
])eculiar scenery of their coimtry ; from 
the idolatries of heathen nations ; from 
their own history and cii'cum stances; 
from the serviceof their temple, and the 
ceremonies of their religion ; from man- 
ners that have faded, and customs that 
have elapsed. Hence many appropri- 
ate beauties have vanished. Many de- 
scriptions and many representations, 
that must have had a solemn importance 
among the Jews, are now considered, 
from a change of circumstances, in a de- 
graded point of view. Hence, likewise, 
here and thei-e a shade of obscurity. In 
general, however, the language of Scrip- 
ture, though highly sublime and beauti- 
ful, is easy- and intelligible to all capaci- 
ties." 

2. Of the use and intent of firofihecy. 
■ As prophecy is so striking a proof of 
a supernatural communion with the 
Deity, and is of so early a date, we may 
rest 'assured it was given for wise and 
important ends. " It cannot be sup- 
posed," says bishop Sherlock, "that 
God delivered prophecies only to satis- 



fy or employ the curiosity of the inqui- 
sitive, or that he gave his Spirit to men 
merely to enable them to give forth 
predictions for the amusement and en- 
tertainment of the world: there must 
be some end worthy of the author." 
Now, what end could this be, but to 
keep alive in the minds of those to whom 
it was. given, a sense of religion, and a 
hope of future deliverance from the 
curse of the fall through Jesus Christ f 
" The uses of pi-ophecy," says Dr. Jor- 
tin, " besides gradually opening and un- 
folding the things relating to the Mes- 
siah, and the blessings which by him 
should be conferred upon mankind, are 
many, great, and manifest. 
■ " i. it served to secure the belief of a 
God, and of a providence. 

" As God is invisible and spiritual, 
there was cause to fear, that, ifi the 
first and rader ages of the world, when 
men were busier in cultivating the earth 
than in cultivating arts and sciences, and 
in seeking the necessaries of life than iu 
the study of morality, they might forget 
their Creator and Governor; and, there- 
fore, God maintained amongst them the 
great article of faith in him, by mani- 
ifestations of himself; by sending an- 
gels to declare his will; by miracles, 
and by prophecies. 

" 2. It was intended to give men the 
profoundest veneration for that amazing 
knowledge from which nothing was con- 
cealed, not even the future actions of 
creatures, and the things which as yet 
were not. How could a ihan hope to 
hide any counsel, any design or thought, 
from such a Being ? 

" 3. It contributed to keep up devo- 
tion and true religion, the religion of the 
heart, which consists partly in enter- 
taining just and honourable notions of 
God, and of his perfections, and which 
is a more rational and a more accepta- 
ble service than rites and cei-emonies. 

" 4. It excited men to i-ely upon God, 
and to love him Avho condescended to 
hold this mutual intercourse with his 
creatures, and to permit them to con- 
sult him, as one friend asks advice of 
another. 

" 5. It was intended to keep the peo- 
ple, to whom God revealed himself, 
from idolatry ; a sin to which the Jews 
would be inclined, both from the dispo- 
sition to it which they had acquired in 
Egypt, and from the contagion of bad 
example. 

The' people of Israel Avere strictly 
forbidden to consult the diviners and 
the gods of other nations, and to use any 
enchantments and wicked arts; and 
that they might have no temptation to

it, God permitted them to apply to him 
and to his prophets, even upon small 
occasions; and he raised up amongst 
them a succession of prophets, to whom 
they might have recourse for advice and 
direction. These prophets were re- 
verenced abroad as well as at home, 
and consulted by foreign princes ; and, 
in times of the captivity, they were ho- 
noured by great kings, and advanced to 
high stations." 

As it respects us, prophecy connect- 
ed with miracles affords a considerable 
evidence of the truth of revelation, as 
well as of a superintending Providence. 
This evidence too, is a growing evi- 
dence. "The divine design, uniformly 
pursued through a series of successive 
generations, opens with a gi'eater de- 
gree of clearness, in proportion to the 
lapse of time and the number of events. 
An increase of age is an addition to its 
strength ; and the nearer we approach 
the point towards which the dispensa- 
tions of God unvaryingly tend, the more 
clearly shall we discern the wonderful 
regularity, consistency, and beauty of 
this stupendous plan for universal good. 
Of the great vise of prophecies which 
have been fulfilled, as a direct and 
strong ar§;ument to convert unbelievers 
to Christianity, and to establisli Chris- 
tians in the faith, we have the most am- 
ple proofs. Our Lord himself made 
very frequent appeals to prophecy as 
evidence of his divine mission: he re- 
ferred the Jews to their own Scriptures, 
as niost fully and clearly bearing wit- 
ness of himself. Upon them he ground- 
ed the necessity of his sufferings ; upon 
them he settled the faith of the disci- 

i)les at Emmaus, and of the apostles at 
erusalem. The same source supplied 
the eloquence of St. Peter and St. Paul, 
and the means with which Apollos 
'mightily convinced the Jews.' This 
was a powerful instiiiment of persuasion 
in the succeeding ages of the church, 
when used by the primitive apologists. 
Upon this topic were emjjloyed the 
zeal and diligence not only of Justin 
Martyr, but Tertullian, Cyprian, and 
Augustin. It would never have been so 
frequently employed, if it had not been 
well adapted to the desired end ; and 
that it did most completely answer this 
end, by the conversion ot unbelievers, 
is evident from the accounts of Scrip- 
ture, and the records of the primitive 
church. 

"Prophecy keeps the attention of 
Christians alive to the truth and impor- 
tance of their holy religion: to its truth, 
because prophecy and Christianity had 
one and the same origin, both being de- 



rived from the same fountain of per- 
fection ; it keeps them alive to its im- 
portance, because prophecy shows that 
the Supreme Being has vouchsafed, 
through a long succession of ages, to 
prepai-e mankind, by gradual revela- 
tions of his will, for future blessings; 
and has proved, by sending chosen mes- 
sengers to usher in this final dispensa- 
tion, that ' the testimony of Jesus is the 
spirit of prophecy.' ^ It confirms the 
general belief of a God, and points out 
to a careless world the plain traces of 
his watchful providence. It displays the 
counsels of inspiration, incessantly di- 
recting the course of events, without 
violating the order of reason and of hu- 
man action. Such knowledge is too 
wonderful for us ! such power is above 
our comprehension ! But the fact is 
placed before our eyes. We see, or may 
see, a regular train of prophecies tend- 
ing towards one declared end, accurate- 
ly fulfilled and fulfilling amidst all the 
confusion and opposition of this tumultu- 
ous world ; and we see that these pro- 
phecies ai-e clear, both in prediction 
and accomplishment, in proportion to 
their importance in fixhig our belief in 
the pro\'idence of God, and in the great 
truths of divine revelation. Thus it ap- 
pears that the chief design of pi'ophecy 
is to bear constant witness to religious 
truth ; but though to convince gainsay- 
ers of this truth is justly considered as 
its principal use, it has another very 
important object, to which it well be- 
comes us to pay attention, from motives 
of gratitude, as well as from fear of in- 
curring the blame which Scripture in- 
variably imputes to those who neglect 
to take advantage of the light afforded 
them. It is designed to protect be- 
lievers in the word of God from the 
dangers arising from the prevalent cor- 
ruptions, errors, and vices of the age in 
which they live. The due consideration 
of prophecy will administer consolation 
amidst present distress, and enliven 
faith and elevate hope, whilst passing- 
through those dai-k depressing scenes, 
which, without this gracious aid, might 
lead through the intricacies of doubt to 
the gloom of despair." 

Objections, however, have been raised 
agahist the prophecies from their ob- 
scurity. But to this it is answered, that 
they have often a first, or jjartial, and an 
ultimate completion, of which the for- 
mer may be generally considered as an 
earnest of the latter. It is principally 
this double sense of prophecy which 
renders it obscure ; for though the pre- 
dictions of the prophets were sometimes 
positive and exactly descriptive, and de- 
3R

livered -with an accurate and definite 
designation of names and times, pro- 
2)hecy was not generally designed to be 
clear befoi'e its accomplisliment. It is, 
however, always sufficiently exact in its 
descriptions to authenticate its preten- 
sions to a divine authority ; to produce, 
when it comes to pass, an acknowledg- 
ment of its unerring certainty ; and to 
demonstrate the wisdom and power of 
Ciod. As Bishop Newton observes, pro- 
phecies are the only species of writing 
which are designed more for the instruc- 
tion of future ages than of the times 
wherein they ai*e written. In this re- 
spect, as the world groweth older, it 
groweth wiser. Time, that deti-acts 
something from the evidence of other 
writers, is still adding something to the 
credit and authority of the prophets. 
Future ages will comprehend more 
than the present, as the present under- 
stands more than the past ; and the 
perfect accomplishment will produce a 
perfect knowledge of all the prophe- 
cies. 

3. Of the fnljilment oj firofihecy. 

Our limits will not permit us to give a 
copious account of the various prophe- 
cies which have been remarkably ful- 
filled ; but whoever has examined pro- 
fane history with any degree of atten- 
tion, and compared it witli the predic- 
tions of Scripture, must, if he be not 
blinded by prejudice, and haixlened by 
infidelity, be convinced of the truth of 

firophecy by its exact accomplishment, 
t is in vain to say that these prophecies 
were delivered since the events have 
taken place ; for we see the prophecies, 
the latest whereof were delivered about 
1700 years ago, and some of them above 
oOOO years ago, fulfilling at this very 
time; and cities, and countries, and 
kingdoms, in the very same condition, 
and all brought about in the very same 
manner, and with the very same cir- 
cumstances, as the prophets had fore- 
told. "We see," says Bishop New- 
ton, "the descendants of Shem and 
Japheth, ruUng and enlarged in Asia 
and Europe, and perhaps in America, 
and 'the curse of servitude,' still at- 
tending the wretched descendants of 
Ham in Africa. We see the posterity 
of Ishmael, ' multiplied exceedingly,' 
and become 'a gi'eat nation,' in the Ara- 
bians; yet living like 'wild men,' and 
shifting from place to place in the wil- 
derness; * their hand against every 
man, and every man's hand against 
them ;' and still dwelling an indepen- 
dent and free people, ' in the presence 
of all their brethren,' and in the pre- 
sence of all their enemies. We see the 



family of Esau totally extinct, and that 
of Jacob subsisting at this day; 'the 
sceptre departed from Judah,' and the 
people livmg no where in authority, 
e\ ery where in subjection; the Jews still 
dwelling alone among the nations, while 
' the remembrance of Amalek is utter- 
ly put out from under lieaven.' W^e see 
tne Jews severely punished for their in- 
fidelity and disobedience to their great 
prophet like unto Moses : ' plucked 
from off their own land, and removed 
into all the kingdoms of the earth ; op- 
pressed and spoiled evermore ;' and 
made ' a proverb and a by-word among 
all nations.' We see * Ephraim so bro- 
ken as to be no more a people,' while 
the whole nation is comprehended un- 
der the name of Judah ; the Jews won- 
derfully preserved as a distinct people, 
while their great conquerors are every 
where destroyed ; their land lying de- 
solate, and themselves cut oif from be- 
ing the people of God, while the Gen- 
tiles are advanced in their room. We 
See Nineveh so completely destroyed, 
that the place thereof is not and cannot 
be known; Babylon made 'a desola- 
tion for ever, a possession for the bit- 
tern, and pools of water;' Tyre become 
Mike the top of a rock, z place for 
fishers to spread their nets upon ;' and 
Egypt, 'a base kingdom, the basest of 
the kingdoms,' and still tributary and 
subject to strangers. We see, of the 
four gi-eat empires of the world, the 
fourth and last, which was greater and 
moi-e powerfxd than any of the former, 
divided in the western part thereof into 
ten lesser kingdoms ; and among them 
a power 'with a triple crown differs 
from the first,' with ' a mouth speaking 
very great things,' and with 'a look 
more stout than his fellows, speaking 
great words against the Most High, 
wearing out the saints of the Most 
High, and changing times and laws.' 
We see a power ' cast down the truth 
to the ground, and prosper, and prac- 
tise, and destroy the holy people, not re- 
garding the Ciod of his fathers, nor the 
desire of wives, but honouring Mahuz- 
zim,' gods-protectors, or saints-protec- 
tors, ' and causing' the priests of Ma- 
huzzim ' to rule over many, and to di- 
vide the land for gain.' We see the 
Turks 'stretching forth their hand 
over the countries,' and particularly 
• over the land of Egypt, the Lybians at 
their steps,* and the Arabians still 
' escaping out of their hand.' We see 
the Jews • led away captive into all na- 
tions, and Jenisalem trodden down of 
the Gentiles,' and likely to continue so 
' until the times of the Gentiles be ful-

filled,' as the Jews are by a constant 
miracle preserved a distinct people for 
the completion of other prophecies re- 
lating to them. We see one ' who op- 
{)oseth and exalteth himself above all 
aws, divine and human, ' sitting as God 
in the church of God, and showing him- 
self that he is God, whose coming is af- 
ter the working of Satan, with all power, 
and signs, and lying wonders, and with 
all deceivableness of unrighteousness.' 
We see a great afiostacy in tlie Chris- 
tian church, which consists chiefly in 
the worship of demons, angels, or de- 
parted saints, and is promoted ' through 
the hypoci'isy of liars, forbidding to mar- 
ry, and commanding to abstain from 
meats. \A'e see the seven churches of 
Asia lying in the same forlorn and deso- 
late condition that the angel had signi- 
fied to St. John, their ' candlestick re- 
moved cut of its place,' their churches 
turned into mosques, their worship into 
superstition. In short, we see the cha- 
racters of ' the beast and tlie false pro- 
phet,' and ' the whore of Babylon,' now 
exemplified in every particular, and in 
a city that is seated ' upon seven moun- 
tains ;' so that, if the bishop of Rome 
had set for his picture, a greater resem- 
blance and likeness could not have been 
drawn. 

" For these things we have tlie attes- 
tation of past, and the experience of 
present times ; and we cannot well be 
deceived, if we will only believe our own 
eyes and observation. We actually sec 
the completion of many of the prophe- 
cies in the state of men and things 
around us; and we have the prophecies 
themselves recorded in bx^oks, which 
books have been read in ])ublic assem- 
blies these 1700 or 2000 years, have 
been disjjei'sed into several countries, 
have been translated into se\erai lan- 
guages, and quoted and commented 
upon by different nations, so that there 
is no room to suspect so much as a pos- 
sibility of forgery or illusion." 

4. Rules for understanding the firo- 
fihecies. 

In order to understand the prophe- 
cies, and to form a right judgment of 
the argument for the trut'li of Chris- 
tianit} , we must not consider tliem singly 
and apart, but as a grand wlmle, or a 
chain reaching through several tliousand 
years, yet manifestly subservient to one 
and the same end. This end is no otlicr 
than the estabhshment of the xiniversal 
empire of truth and righteousness under 
the dominion of Jesus Christ. We are 
not, indeed, to suppose that each of the 
prophecies recorded in the Old Testa- 
ment expressly points out, and clearly 



characterizes Jesus Christ ; yet, taken 
as a whole, this grand system refers to 
hill) ; for the testimony of Jesus is the 
spirit of ptxiphec)'. " All the revolu- 
tions of divine providence have him for 
their scope and end. Is an empire, or 
kingdom erected? that empire, or king- 
dom is erected with a view, directly or 
indirectly, to the kingdom of the Mes- 
siah. Is an empire, or kingdom, sub- 
verted or overthrown ? that empire, or 
kingdom, is overthrown in subserviency 
to the glory of his kingdom and em- 
pire, which shall know neither bounds 
nor end, but whose limits shall be no 
other than the limits of the universe, 
and whose end no other than the days of 
eternity. Jesus Christ, then, is the only 
person that ever existed in whom all 
the propliecies meet as in a centre." 
In order, therefore, to oppose error and 
confront the infidel, we must study the 
prophecies not as independent of each 
other, but as connected ; for " the ar- 
gument from prophecy," says Bishop 
Hurd, " is not to oe formed from the 
consideration of single prophecies, but 
from all the prophecies taken together, 
and considered as making one system ; 
in which, from the mutual dependence 
and connection of its parts, preceding 
prophecies prepare and illustrate those 
which follow ; and the;^, again, reflect 
light on the foregoing : just as in any 
pliilosophical system, that which shows 
the solidity of it is the harmony and cor- 
respondence of the whole, not the ap- 
plication of it in particular instances. 

" Hence, though the evidence be but 
small from the completion of any one 
prophecy taken separately, yet that 
evidence, being always something, the 
amount of the whole evidence resulting 
from a great number of prophecies, all 
relati\e to the same design, may be 
considerable ; like many scattered rays, 
which, though each be weak in itself, 
yet, concentrated into one point, shall 
form a strong light, and strike the sense 
very powerfully. Still more ; this evi- 
dence is not merely a growing evi- 
dence, but is indeed multiplied upon 
us, from tlie number of reflected lights 
which the several component parts of 
such a system reciprocally throw upon 
Ciich ; till, at length, the conviction 
rises unto a high degree of moral cer- 
tainty." 

Farther, in order to understand the 
prophecies, we must endeavour to find 
out the true subject of propliecy ; that' 
is, [)recisely what the propliets speak of, 
and the characters that are applied to 
that subject. The literal sense should 
be always kept in view, and a know-

led.^e of oriental customs attended. The 
beginning and end of the prof)hetic ser- 
mons must be carefully observed. The 
time, as near as possible, of the predic- 
tion, should be ascertained. An ac- 
quaintance with the metliod of salvation 
by Christ will greatly assist us in this 
work. The mind must be unprejudiced, 
and we should be well acquainted with 
the Scriptures at large. These rules, 
"with dependence on the divine teaching, 
will assist us in understanding the pro- 
phecies. See Bisho/i A^ewton's Dis- 
sertations on the Profihecies ; Bishop 
Sher/ock's Use and Intent of Profihecy;

PROPHESYINGS, religious exer- 
cises of the clergy in the reign of Queen 
Elizabeth, instituted for the purpose of 
promoting knowledge and piety. The 
jiiinisters of a particular division at a 
bet time met together in some church of 
a market or other large town, and there 
each in their order explained, according 
to their abilities, some portion of Scrip- 
ture allotted to them before. This done, 
a moderator made his observations on 
what had been said, and determined 
the true sense of the place, a certain 
space of time beuig fixed for dispatching 
the whole. These institutions, like all 
others, however, it seems, were abused, 
by irregularity, disputations, and divi- 
sions. Archbishop Grindal endeavoured 
to regulate the prophesyings, and cover 
them from the objections tliat the court 
made against them, by enjoining the 
ministers to observe decency and order, 
by forl)idding them to meddle with poli- 
tics and church government, and by 
prohibiting all non-conformist ministers 
and laymen from being speakers. The 
queen, however, was resolved to sup- 
press them ; and having sent for the 
archbishop, told him she was informed 
that the rites and ceremonies of the 
church were not duly observed in these 
prophesyings; that persons not law- 
fully called to be ministers exercised in 
them ; that the assemblies themselves 
were illegal, not being allowed by pub- 
lic authority ; that the laity neglected 



their secular affairs by repairing to 
these meetings which filled their heads 
with notions, and might occasion dis- 
putes and sedition in the state ; that it 
was good for the church to have but 
few preachers, three or four in a coun- 
ty being sufficient. She further declar- 
ed her dislike of the number of these 
exercises, and therefore commanded 
him peremptorily to put them down. 
The archbishopj however, instead of 
obeying the commands of his royal mis- 
tress, thought that she had made some 
infringement upon his office, and wrote 
the queen a long and earnest letter, de- 
claring that his conscience would not 
suffer him to comply with her com- 
mands. The queen was so inflamed 
with this letter, that the archbishop was 
sequestered from his office, and he ne- 
A'er afterwards recovered the queen's 
favour. Thus ended the prophesyings; 
"a useful institution," says Neale, "for 
promoting Christian knowledge and 
piety, at a time when both were at 
a very low ebb in the nation. The 
queen put them down for no other rea- 
son, but because they enlightened the 
people's minds in the Scriptures, and 
encouraged their inquiries after truth ; 
her majesty being always of opinion 
that knowledge and learning in the laity 
would only endanger their peaceable 
submission to her absolute will and 
pleasure." 

PROPHET, a person who foretels 
future events. It is particularly applied 
to such inspired persons among the Jews 
as were commissioned by God to declare 
his will and purposes to that people. 
See Prophecy. 

False Prophets. See Impostors ; 
and Josephus's Hist, of the Jews. 

Sojis of the Prophets, an appellation 
given to young men who were educated 
in the schools or colleges under a proper 
master, who was commonly, if not al- 
ways, an inspired prophet in the know- 
ledge of religion, and in sacred music, 
and thus were qualified to be public 
preachers, 1 Sam. x. 1 Sam. xi. 2 Sam. 
xix. 2 Kings, ii. 

PROPITIATION, a sacrifice offered 
to God to assuage his wrath, and render 
him propitious. Among the Jews, there 
were both ordinary and public sacrifices, 
as holocausts, 8cc. offered by way of 
thanksgiving ; and extraordinary ones, 
offered by persons guilty of any crime, 
by way of propitiation. The Romish 
church believe the mass to be a sacri- 
fice of propitiation for the living and the 
dead. The reformed churches allow of 
no propitiation, but that one offered by 
Jesus on the cross, whereby divine Jus:-

tice is appeased, and our sins forgiven, 
Rom. iii. 25. 1 John, ii. 2. 

As it respects the unbloody propitia- 
tory sacrifice of the mass above-men- 
tioned, little need be said to confute such 
a doctrine. Indeed, it is owned in the 
church of Rome, that there is no other 
foundation for the belief of it than an 
unwritten tradition. There is no hint 
in the Scripture of Christ's offering his 
body and blood to his Father at his in- 
stitution of the eucharist. It is also a 
manifest contradiction to St. Paul's doc- 
trine, who teaches, that, without shed- 
ding of blood, there is no remission ; 
therefore thei'e can be no remission of 
sins in the mass. The sacrifice of Christ, 
according to the same apostle, is not to 
be repeated. A second oblation would 
be supei'fluous ; consequently the pre- 
tended true and proper sacrifice of the 
mass must be superfluous and useless. 

The propitiation made by Jesus Christ 
is that which atones for and covers our 
guilt, as the mercy-seat did the tables of 
the law ; or it may be defined thus : 
" It is the avei'ting the punishment due 
to any one, by undergoing the penalty in 
tlie room of the guilty." Thus Jesus 
Christ is called the propitiation or 
atonement, as his complete righteous- 
ness appeases his Father, and satisfies 
his law and justice for all our trans- 
gressions. See Atonement, and books 
under that article. 

PROPORTION OF FAITH. See 
Analogy of Faith. 

PROSELYTE, a new convert to 
some religion or religious sect. Among 
the Hebrews, proselytes were distin- 
guished into two sorts : the first called 
proselytes of the gate, because suffered 
to live among them, and were those who 
observed the moral law only, and the 
rules imposed on the children of Noah ; 
the second were called proselytes of 
justice, who engaged to i-eceive circum- 
cision, and the whole law of Moses, and 
enjoyed all the privileges of a native 
Hebrew. 

PROSEUCHE, from n^oat^rx, signi- 
fies prayer ; but it is taken for the places 
of prayer of the Jews, and was pretty 
near the same as their synagogues. But 
the synagogues were originally in the ci- 
ties, and were covered places ; where- 
as, for the most part, the proseuches, 
were out of the cities, and on the banks 
of rivers, having no covering, except, 
perhaps, the shade of some trees or 
covered galleries. Acts xvi. 13. 

PROSPERITY, a state wherein 
things succeed, according to our wishes, 
and are productive of affluence and 
ease. However desirable prosperity be, 



it has its manifest disadvantages. It too 
often alienates the soul from God ; ex- 
cites pride ; exposes to temptation ; 
hardens the heart ; occasions idleness ; 
promotes effeminacy ; damps zeal and 
energy ; and, too often has a baneful 
relative influence. It is no wonder, 
therefore, that the Almighty in general 
withholds it from his children; and that 
adversity should be their lot rather than 
prosperity. Indeed adversity seems 
more beneficial on the whole, although 
it be so unpleasant to our feelings. " The 
advantages of prosperity," says Bacon, 
" are to be wished ; but the advantages 
of adversity are to be admired. The 
principal virtue of prosperity, is tem- 
perance ; the principal virtue of adver- 
sity, is fortitude, which in morality is 
allowed to be the most heroical virtue : 
prosperity best discovers vice, adversity 
best discovers virtue, which is like those 
perfumes that are most fragrant when 
burnt or bruised." It is not, however, 
to be understood, that prosperity in it- 
self is unlawful. The world with all its 
various productions was formed by the 
Almighty for the happiness of man, and 
designed to endear himself to us, and to 
lead our minds up to him. What how- 
ever God often gives us as a blessing, 
by our own folly we pervert and tui-n 
into a curse. Where prosperity is 
given, there religion is absolutely ne- 
cessary to enable us to act under it as 
we ought. Where this divine principle 
influences the mind, prosperity may be 
enjoyed and become a blessing ; for 
"While bad men snatch the pleasures 
of the world as by stealth, without 
countenance from God, the proprietor 
of the world ; the righteous sit openly 
down to the feast of life, under the 
smile of heaven. No guilty fears damp 
their joys. The blessing of God rests 
upon all they possess. Their piety re- 
flects sunshine from heaven upon the 
prosperity of the world ; unites in one 
point of view the smiling aspect, both 
of the powers above, and of the objects 
below. Not only have they as full a 
relish as others of the innocent plea- 
sures of life, but moreover, in them 
they hold communion with God. In all 
that is good or fair, they trace his hand. 
From the beauties of nature, from the 
improvements of art, from the enjoy- 
ments of social life, thev raise their af- 
fections to the source of all the happi- 
ness which surrounds them, and thus 
widen the sphere of their pleasures, by 
adding intellectual and spiritual to 
earthly joys. Blair's Sermons, vol. i. 
ser. 3. Bates's Works, p. 297. 
Spiritual prosperity consists in the

continual progress of the mind in know- 
ledge, purity, and joy. It arises from 
the participation of the divine blessing ; 
and evidences itself by frequency in 
prayer; love to God's word; delight 
m his people ; attendance on his ordi- 
nances ; zeal in his cause ; submission 
to his will ; usefulness in his church ; 
and increasing abhorrence of every thhig 
that is derogatory to his glory. 

PROTESTANT, a name first given 
in Germany to those who adhei-ed to 
the doctrine of Luther, because in 1529, 
they protested against a decree of the 
emjjeror Charles V. and the diet of 
Spires; declaring that they appealed 
to a general council. The same has also 
been given to those of the sentiments of 
Calvin ; and is now become a common 
denomination for all those of the reform- 
ed churches. See article Rf:FORMA- 
TION ; Fell's Four Letters on genuine

PROVIDENCE, the superintendence 
and care which God exercises over 
creation. The arguments for the pro- 
vidence of God are generally drawn 
from the light of nature ; the being of a 
God ; the creation of the world ; the 
wonderfully disposing and controlling 
the affairs and actions of men ; from the 
absolute necessity of it ; from the va- 
rious blessings enjoyed by his creatures; 
the awful judgments that have been in- 
flicted ; and from the astonishing pre- 
servation of tlie Bible and the church 
through every age, notwithstanding the 
attempts of earth and hell against them. 
Providence has been divided into im- 
mediate and mediate, ordinary and ex- 
traordinary, common and special, uni- 
Acrsal and particular. Immediate pro- 
vidence is what is exercised by God 
himself, without the use of any instru- 
ment or second cause ; mediate provi- 
dence is what is exercised in the use 
of means ; ordinary providence is what 
is exercised in the common course of 
means, and by the chain of second 
causes ; extraordinary is what is out of 
the common way, as miraculous opera- 
tions ; common providence is what be- 
longs to the whole world ; s/iecial, what 
relates to the church ; universal relates 
to the general upholding and preserving 
all things ; particular relates to indivi- 
duals in every actionand circumstance. 
This last, however, is denied by some. 
But, as a good writer observes, "The 
opinion entertained by some that the 
providence of God extends no farther 
than to a general superintendence of 
the laws of nature, without interposing 



in the particular concerns of individual^ 
is contrary both to reason and to Scrip- 
ture. It renders the government of the 
Almighty altogether loose and contin- 
gent, and would leave no ground for 
reposing any trust under its protection ; 
for the majority of human aitairs would 
then be allowed to fluctuate in a fortui- 
tous course, without moving in any regu- 
lar direction, and without tending to any 
one scope. The uniform doctrine of the 
sacred writings is, that thi-oughout the 
universe nothing happens without God^ 
that his hand is ever active, and his de- 
cree or permission intervenes in all ; 
that nothing is too great or unwieldy 
for his management, and nothing so mi- 
nute and inconsiderable as to be below 
his inspection and care. While he is 
guiding the sun and moon in their 
course through the heavens ; while in 
this inferior world he is ruling among 
empires, stilling the ragings of the iva- 
terSf and the tumults of the people, \vq 
is at the same time watching over the 
humble good man, who, in the obscurity 
of his cottage, is serving and worship- 
ping him." 

"In what manner, indeed. Provi- 
dence interposes in human affairs ; by 
what means it influences the thoughts 
and counsels of men, and, notwith- 
standing the influence it exerts, leaves 
to them the freedom of choice, are 
subjects of dark and mysterious nature, 
and which have given occasion to many 
an intricate controversy. Let us re- 
member, that the manner in which 
God influences the motion of all the 
heavenly bodies, the nature of that se- 
cret power by which he is ever direct- 
ing the sun and the moon, the planets, 
stars, and comets, in their course 
through the heavens, while they ap- 
pear to move themselves in a free 
course, are matters no less inexplicable 
to us than the manner in which he in- 
fluences the councils of men. But 
though the mode of divine operation re- 
mains unknown, the fact of an over- 
niling influence is equally certain in the 
moral as it is in the natural world. In 
cases where the fact is clearly authen- 
ticated, we are not at liberty to call its 
tmth in question, merely because we 
understand not the manner in which it 
is brought about. Nothing can be more 
clear, from the testimony of Scripture, 
than that God takes part in all that • 
happens among mankind ; directing and 
over-ruling the whole course of events 
so as to make every one of them answer 
the designs of his wise and righteous 
government. We cannot, indeed, con- 
ceive God acting as the governor of the 



PRO 



503 



PRO 



world at all, unless his government were 
to extend to all the events that happen. 
It is upon the supposition of a particu- 
lar providence that our worship and 
pra\'ers to him are founded. All his 
perfections would be utterly insignifi- 
cant to us, if they were not exercised, 
on every occasion, according as the cir- 
cumstances of his creatures required. 
The Almighty would then be no more 
than an unconcerned spectator of the 
behaviour of his subjects, regarding the 
obedient and the rebellious with an, 
equal eye. 

" The experience of every one also, 
must, more or less, bear testimony to it. 
We need not for this purpose have re- 
course to those sudden and unexpected 
vicissitudes which have sometimes as- 
tonished whole nations, and drawn their 
attention to the conspicuous hand of 
heaven. We need not appeal to the 
liistory of the statesman and the war- 
i-ior ; of the ambitious and the enter- 
prising. We confine our observation to. 
those whose lives have been most plain 
and simple, and who had no desire to 
depart li'om the ordinary train of con- 
duct. In how many instances have we 
found, that we are held in subjection to 
a higher Power, on whom depends tlie 
accomplishment of our wishes and de- 
signs .■* Fondly we had projected some 
favourite plan : we thought that we had 
forecast and provided for all that might 
happen ; we had taken our measures 
with such vigilant prudence, that on 
every side we seemed to ourselves per- 
fectly guarded and secure ; but, lo I 
some little event hath come about, un- 
foreseen by us, and in its consequences 
at the • first seemingly inconsiderable, 
which yet hath turned the whole course 
of things into a new direction, and 
blasted all our hopes. At other times 
our counsels and plans have been per- 
mitted to succeed : we then applauded 
our own wisdom, and sat down to feast 
on the happiness we had attained. To 
our surprise we found that happiness 
was not there, and that God's decree 
had appointed it to be only vanity. We 
labour for prosperity, and obtain it not. 
Unexpected, it is sometimes made to 
drop upon us as of its own accord. The 
happiness of man depends on seci"et 
springs too nice and delicate to be ad- 
justed by human art : it requires a fa- 
vourable combination of external cir- 
cumstances with the state of his own 
mind. To accomplish on every occa- 
sion such a combination, is far beyond 
his power : but it is what God can at all 
times effect ; as the whole series of ex- 
ternal causes are arranged according to 



his pleasure, and the hearts of all men 
are in his hands, to turn them nvhereso- 
ever he will, as rivers of ivater. From 
the imperfection of our knowledge to 
ascertain what is good for us, and fi-om 
the defect of our power to bring about 
that good when known, arise all those 
disappointments which continually tes- 
tify tliat the way of man is not in him- 
self; that he is not the master of his 
own lot ; that, though he may devise, it 
is God who directs; God, who can 
make the smallest incident an effectual 
instrument of his providence for over- 
turning the most laboured plans of 
men. 

" Accident, and chance, and fortune, 
are words which we often hear men- 
tioned, and much is ascribed to them ih 
the life of man. But they are words 
without meaning ; or, as far as they 
have any signification, they are no other 
than names for the unknown operations 
of Providence ; for it is certain that ia 
God's universe nothing comes to pass 
causelessly, or in vain. Every event has 
its own determined direction. That 
chaos of human affairs and intrigues 
where we can see no light, that mass of 
disorder and confusion which they of- 
ten present to our view, is all clearness 
and order in the sight of Him who is 
governing and directing all, and bring- 
ing forward every event in its due time 
and place. The Lord sitteth on the 
flood. The Lord viaketh the wrath of 
mafi to praise him, as he maketh the 
hail and the rain obey his word. He 
hath firepared his throne in the heaveris; 
mid his kingdom ruleth over all. A 
7nan^s heart deviseth his way, but the 
Lord directeth his stefis." 

"To follow the leadings of provi- 
dence, means no other than to act 
agreeably to the law of duty, prudence, 
and safety, or any particular circum- 
stance, according to the direction or de- 
termination of the word or law of God. 
He follows the dictates of Providence, 
who takes a due survey of the situation 
he is placed in, compares it with the 
rules of the word which reaches his 
case, and acts accordingly. To know 
the will of God as it respects provi- 
dence, there must be, 1. Deliberation. 
— 2. Consultation. — 3. Supplication. The 
tokens of the divine will and pleasure in 
any particular case are not to be gath- 
ered from our inclinations, particular 
j frames, the form of Scripture phrases, 
impulses, nor even the event, as that 
camiot always be a rule of judgment ; 
but whatever appears to be proper du- 
ty, true prudence, or real necessity, that 
we shomd esteesi to be his will." Set

PRUDENCE is the act of suiting 
■words and actions according to the 
circumstance of things, or rules of right 
reason : Cicero thus defines it : " Est 
rerum expetendarum fugiendarum sci- 
entia." — "The knowledge of what is 
to be desired or avoided." Grove thus : 
" Prudence is an ability of judging what 
is best in the choice both of ends and 
means." Mason thus : " Prudence is a 
conformity to the rules of reason, ti-uth, 
and decency, at all times, and in all cir- 
cumstances. It differs from wisdom 
only in degree ; wisdom being nothing 
but a more consummate habit of pni- 
dence ; and prudence a lower degree 
or weaker habit of Avisdom." It is 
divided into, 1. Christian pnidence, 
which directs to the pursuit of that 
blessedness which the (iospel discovers 
by the use of Gospel means. — 2. Moral 
prudence has for its end peace and sa- 
tisfaction of mind in this world, and the 
greatest happiness after death. — 3. Ci- 
vil prudence is the knowledge of what 
ought to be done in order to secure the 
outward happiness of life, consisting in 
prosperity, liberty, &amp;c. — 4. Monastic, 
relating to any circumstances in which 
a man is not charged with the care of 
others. — 5. (Economical prudence re- 
gards the conduct of a family. — 6. Po- 
litical refers to the good government 
of a state. 

The idea of pinidence, says one, in- 
cludes fu^sXia, or due consultation : that 
is, concerning such things as demand 
consultation in a right manner, and for 
a competent time, that the resolution 
taken up may be neither too precipitate 
nor too slow ; and o-uvtais, or a faculty of 
discerning pi'oper means when they oc- 
cur. To the perfection of prudence 
these three things are farther required, 
viz. ^fivclns.or a natural sagacity. A7xiwia, 
presence of mind, or a i-eady turn of 
thought ; and Eutteipo, or experience. 

Plato styles prudence the leading 
virtue ; and Cicero observes, "that not 
one of the virtues can want pi-udence," 
which is certainly most true, since with- 
out pnidence to guide them, piety would 
degenerate into superstition, zeal into 
bigotry, temperance into austerity, cou- 
rage into rashness, and justice itself into 
folly. See Watts's Ser. ser. 28; Grove's I

PSALMODY, the art or act of sing- 
ing psalms. Psalmody was always es- 
teemed a considerable part of devotion, 
and usually performed in the standing 
posture ; and as to the manner of pro- 
nunciation, the plain song was some- 
times used, being a gentle inflection of 
the voice, not much different from read- 
ing, like the chant in cathedrals; at 
other times more artificial compositions 
were used, like our anthems. 

As to the persons concerned in sing- 
ing, sometimes a single person sung 
alone ; sometimes the whole assembly 
joined together, which was the most an- 
cient and general practice. At other 
times, the psalms were sung alternately, 
the congregation dividing themselves 
into two parts, and singing verse about, 
in their turns. There was also a fourth 
way of singing, pretty common in the 
fourth century, which was, when a sin- 
gle person began the verse, and the 
people joined with him in the close : 
this was often used for variety in the 
same ser\ice with alternate psalmody. 
See Singing. 

PSAl'YRIANS, a sect of Arianswho 
in the council of Antioch, held in the 
year 360, maintained that the Son was 
not like the Father as to will; that he. 
was taken from nothing, or made of 
nothing; and that in God generation 
was not to be distinguished from crea- 
tion. 

PURGATORY is a place in which 
the just who depart out of this life are 
supposed to expiate certain offences 
which do not merit eternal damnation. 
Broughton has endeavoured to prove 
that this notion has been held by Pa- 
gans, Jews, and Mahometans, as well 
as by Christians ; and that, in the days 
of the Maccabees, the Jews believed 
that sin might be expiated by sacrifice 
after the death of the sinner. The ar- 
guments advanced by the Papists for 
purgatory are these : 1. Every sin, how 
slight soever, though no more than an 
idle word, as it is an offence to God, de- 
serves punishment from him, and will 
be punished by him hereafter, if not 
cancelled by repentance here. — 2. Such 
small sins do not deserve eternal pun- 
ishment. — 3. Few depart this life so 
pure as to be totally exempt from spots 
of this nature, and from every kind of 
debt due to God's justice. — 4. There- 
fore few will escape without suffering 
something from his justice for sucJi 
debts as they have carried with them 
out of this world, according to that rule

of divine justice, by which he treats 
every soul hereafter according to its 
own works, and according to the state in 
which he finds it in death. From these 
propositions, which the Papist considers 
as so many self-evident truths, he infers 
that there must be some third place of 
punishment ; for since the infinite good- 
ness of God can admit nothing into hea- 
ven which is not clean and pure from 
all sin both great and small, and his in- 
finite justice can permit none to receive 
the reward of bliss who as yet are not 
out of debt, but have something in jus- 
tice to suffer, there must of necessity, 
be some place or state, where souls de- 
parting this life, pardoned as to the ex- 
ternal guilt or pain, yet obnoxious to 
some temporal penalty, or with the 
guilt of some venial faults, are purged 
and purified before their admittance in- 
to heaven. And this is what he is taught 
concerning purgatory, which, though he 
know not where it is, of what nature 
the pains are, or how long each soul is 
detained there, yet he believes that 
those who are in this place are relieved 
Dy the prayers of then- fellow-members 
here on earth, as also by alms and 
masses offered up to God for their 
souls. And as for such as have no re- 
lations or friends to pray for them, or 
give alms or procure masses for their 
relief, they are not neglected by the 
church, which makes a general com- 
memoration of all the faithful departed 
in every mass, and in every one of the 
canonical hours of the' divine office. 
Besides the above arguments, the fol- 
lowing passages are alleged as proofs : 
2 Maccabees, xii. 43, 44, 45. Matt. xii. 
31, 32. 1 Cor. iii. 15. 1 Pet. iii. 19. But it 
may be observed, 1. That the books of 
Maccabees have no evidence of inspi- 
ration, therefore quotations from them 
are not to be regarded. — 2. If they 
were, the text's referred to would rather 
prove that there is no such place as 
purgatory, since Judas did not expect 
the souls departed to reap any benefit 
from his sin-offering till the resurrection. 
The texts quoted from the Scriptures 
have no reference to this doctrine, as 
may be seen by consulting the context, 
and any just commentator thereon. — 3. 
Scripture, in general, speaks of depart- 
ed souls going immediately at death to 
a fixed state of happiness or miseiy, 
and gives us no idea of purgatorv, Isa. 
Ivii. 2. Rev. xiv. 13. Luke, xvi.' 22. 2 
Cor. v. 8. — 4. It is derogatory from the 
doctrine of Christ's satisfaction. If 
Christ died for us, and redeemed us 
from sin and hell, as the Scripture 
speaks, then the idea of farther merito- 



rious suffering detracts from the pef- 
fection of Christ's work, and places 
merit still in the creature ; a doctrine 
exactly opposite to Scripture. Sec

PURIFICATION, a ceremony which 
consists in cleansing any thing from pol- 
lution or defilement. Purifications are 
common to Jews, Pagans, and Maho- 
metans. See Impurity. 

PURITANS, a name given in the 
primitive church to the Novatians, be- 
I cause they would never admit to com- 
I munion any one, who from dread of 
I death, had apostatized from the faith ; 
I but the word has been chiefly applied to 
I those who were professed favourers of 
a farther degree of reformation and pu- 
rity in the church before the act of uni- 
formity, in 1662. After this period, the 
term Nonconformists became common, 
to which succeeds the appellation Dis- 
senter. 

"During the reign of queen Eliza- 
beth, in which the royal prerogative 
was carried to its utmost limits, there 
were found many "daring spirits who 
questioned the right of the sovei-eign to 
prescribe and dictate to her subjects 
what principles of religion they should 
profess, and what forms they ought to 
adhere to. The ornaments and habits 
worn by ihe clergy in the preceding 
reign, when the Romish religion and 
rites were triumphant, Elizabeth was 
desirous ofp reserving in the Protestant 
service. This was the cause of great 
discontent among a large body of her 
subjects : multitudes refused to attend 
at those churches where the habits 
and ceremonies were used ; the con- 
forming clergy they treated with con- 
tumely; and from the superior purity 
and simplicity of the modes of worship 
to which they adhered, they obtained 
the name of Puritans. The queen 
made many attempts to repress every 
thing that appeared to her as an innova- 
tion in the religion established by her 
authority, but without success : by her 
almost unlimited authority she readily 
checked open and avowed opposition, 
but she could not extinguish the princi- 
ples of the Puritans, ' by whom alone,' 
according to Mr. Hume, * tlie precious 
spark of liberty had been kindled and 
was preserved, and to whom the Eng- 
lish owe the whole fi-eedom of their 
constitution.' Some secret attempts 
that had been made by them to establish 
a separate congregation and discipline.

had been carefully repressed by the 
strict hand Avhich Elizabeth held over 
all her subjects. The most, therefore, 
that they could effect was, to assemble 
in pri^-ate houses, for the purpose of 
worshipping God according to the dic- 
tates of their own consciences. These 
practices were at first connived at, but 
afterwards every mean was taken to 
suppress them, and the most cruel me- 
thods were made use of to discover 
persons who were disobedient to the 
royal pleasure." 

The severe persecutions carried on 
against the Puritans during the reigns 
of Elizabeth and the Stuarts, served to 
lay the foundation of a new empire in 
Xhe A^Testern world. Thither as into a 
wilderness they fled from the face of 
their persecutors, and, being protected 
in the free exercise of their religion, 
continued to increase, till in about a 
century and a half they became an in- 
dependent nation. The different prin- 
ciples, however, on Avhich they had ori- 
ginally divided from the church esta- 
blishment at home, operated in a way 
that might have been expected when 
they came to the possession of the civil 
power abroad. 1 hose who formed the

measure put an end to these pi'oceed- 
ines. 

Neither the Puritans before the pass- 
ing of the BartholomcAv act in 1662, nor 
the Nonconformists after it, appear to 
have disapproved of the articles of the 
established church in matters of doc- 
trine. The number of them Avho did so, 
hoAvever, was very small. While the 
great body of the bishops and clergy had 
from the days of archbishop Laud 
abandoned their oavu articles in favour 
of Arminianism, they Avere attached to 
the principles of the first reformers; 



and by their labours and sufferings the 
spirit of the reformation was kept alive 
in the land. But after the revolution, 
one part of the Protestant Dissenters, 
chieny Presbyterians, first veered to- 
Avards Arminianism, then revived the 
Arian conti-oversy,and by degi'ees many 
of them settled in Socinianism. At the 
satfle time another part of them, chiefly 
Independents and Baptists, earnestly 
contending for the doctrines of grace, 
and conceiving as it Avould seem, that 
the danger of erring lay entirely on one 
side, first veered tOAvards high Calvin- 
ism, then forbore the unregenerate to 
repent, believe, or do any thing practi- 
cally good, and by degrees many of 
them^ it is said, settled in Antinomian- 
ism. 

Such are the principles which haA^e 
found place amongst the descendants of 
the Puritans. At the same time, how- 
ever, it must be acknowledged that a 
goodly number of each of the three de- 
nominations have adhered to the doc- 
trine and spirit of their forefathers : and 
liaA'e proA'Cd the efficacy of their prin- 
ciples by their concern to be holy m all 
manner of conversation. See articles

conformists, in this work. See also

PURITY, the freedom of any thing 
from foreign admixture ; but more par-^ 
ticularly it signifies the temper directly 
opposite to criminal sensualities, or the 
ascendency of irregular passions. [See 
Chastity.] 

Purity implies, 1. A. fixed habitual 
abhorrence of all forbidden indulgences 
of the flesh. — 2. All past impurities, 
either of heart or life, Avill be reflected 
on Avith shame and sorroAv. — 3. The 
heart Avill be freed, in a great measure, 
from impure and irregular desires. — i. 
It Avill discover itself by a cautious fear 
of the least degree of impurity. — 5. It 
implies a careful and habitual guard 
against cA^ery thing Avhich tends to pol- 
lute the mind. See Evans's Sermons 
on the Christian Temper, ser. 23 ; and 
Watts'' s Sermons, ser. 27.

QUAKERS, a sect which took its rise 
in England about the middle of the 
seventeenth century, and rapidly found 
its way into other countries in Europe, 
and into the English settlements in 
North America. The members of this 
society, we believe, called themselves at 
first Seekers, from their seeking the 
truth ; but after the society was form- 
ed, they assumed the appellation of 
Friends. The name of Quakers was 
given to them by their enemies, and 
though an epithet of reproach, seems to 
be stamped upon them indelibly. George 
Fox is supposed to be their first founder; 
but, after the restoration, Penn and Bar- 
clay gave to their principles a more re- 
gular form. 

, The doctrines of the society have 
been variously represented ; and some 
have thought and taken pains to prove 
them favourable to Socinianism. But, 
according to Penn, they believe in the 
Holy Three, or the trmity of the Fa- 
ther, Word, and Spirit, agreeable to the 
Scripture. In reply to the charge that 
they deny Christ to be God, Penn says, 
" that it is a most unti-ue and unchari- 
table censure — that they truly and ex- 
pressly own him to Jae so according to 
the Scripture." To the objection that 
they deny the human nature of Christ, 
he answers, "We never taught, said, 
or held so gross a thing, but believe 
liim to be truly and properly man like 
us, sin only excepted." The doctrines 
of the fall and of the redemption by 
Christ ai-e, according to him, believed 
firmly by them ; and he declares " that 
they own Jesus Christ as their sacrifice, 
atonement, and propitiation." 

But we shall here state a further ac- 
count of their principles and discipline, 
as extracted from a summai-y transmit- 
ted to me from one of their most re- 
spectable members. 

They tell us, that, about the beginning 
of the seventeenth century, a number 
of men, dissatisfied with all the modes of 
religious worship then known in the 
world, withdrew from the communion 
of every visible church to seek the 
Lord in retirement. Among these was 
their honourable elder, Geori^e Fox, 
who, being quickened by the immediate 
touches of divine love, could not satisfy 
his apprehensions of duty to God with- 
out directing the people where to find 



the like consolation and instruction. In 
the course of his travels, he met with 
many seeking persons in circumstances 
similar to his own, and these readily re- 
ceived his testimony. They then give 
us a short account of their sufFermgs 
and different settlements; they also vin- 
dicate Charles II. from the character 
of a persecutor ; acknowledging that, 
though they suffered much during his 
reign, he gave as little countenance as 
he could to the severities of the legisla- 
ture. They even tell us that he exert- 
ed his influence to rescue their friends 
from the unprovoked and cruel perse- 
cutions they met with in New England ; 
and they speak with becoming gratitude 
of the different acts passed in their fa- 
vour during the reigns of William and 
Maiy, and George I. They then pro- 
ceed to give us the following account of 
their doctrine. 

" We agree with other professors of 
the Christian name, in the belief of one 
eternal God, the Creator and Pre- 
sei-A^er of the universe ; and in Jesus 
Christ his Son, the Messiah and me- 
diator of the new covenant, Heb, xii. 24. 

"When we speak of the gracious 
display of the love of God to mankind, 
in the miraculous conception, birth, life, 
miracles, death, resurrection, and as- 
cension of our Saviour, we prefer the 
use of such terms as we find in Scrip- 
ture ; and contented with that know- 
ledge which divine wisdom hath seen 
meet to reveal, we attempt not to ex- 
plain those mysteries which remain un- 
der the veil ; nevertheless we acknow- 
ledge and assert the divinity of Christ, 
who is the wisdom and power of God 
unto salvation, 1 Cor. i. 24. 

" To Christ alone we give the title of 
the Word of God, John, i. 1. and not to 
the Scriptures, although we highly es- 
teem these saci-ed writings, in subordi- 
nation to the Spirit (2 Pet. i. 21.) from 
which they wei-e given forth ; and we 
hold with the apostle Paul, that they 
are able to make wise unto salvation, 
through faith, which is in Chi-ist Jesus, 
2 Tim. iii. 15, 

" We reverence those most excellent 
precepts which are recoided in Scrip- 
ture to have been delivered by our great 
Lord ; and we firmly believe that they 
are practicable, and binding on every 
Christian ; and that in the life to come

every man will be rewarded accoi-ding 
to his works, Matt. xvi. 27. And fur- 
ther ; it is our belief, that in order to 
enable mankind to put in practice 
these sacred precepts, many ot which 
are contradictory to the unregenerate 
will of man, John, i. 9. eveiy man 
coming into the world is endued with a 
measure of the light, grace, or good 
Spirit of Christ ; by which, as it is at- 
tended to, he is enabled to distinguish 
good from evil, and to correct the dis- 
orderly passions and corrupt propensi- 
ties of his nature, which mere reason is 
altogether insufficient to o\-ercome. For 
all that belongs to man is fallible, and 
within the reach of temptation ; but 
this divine grace, which comes by him 
■who hath overcome the world, John, 
xvi. 33. is, to those who humbly and 
sincerely seek it, an all-sufficient and 
present help in time of need. By this- 
the snares of the enemy are detected, 
his allurements avoided, and deliver- 
ance is experienced through faith in its 
effectual opei'ation ; whereby the so\d 
IS translated out of the kingdom of dark- 
ness, and from under the power of Sa- 
tan, unto the marvellous light and king- 
dom of the Son of God. 

" Being thus persuaded that man, 
&gt;vithout the Spirit of Christ inwaidly 
I'evealed, can do nothing to the glory of 
God, or to effect his own salvation, we 
think this influence especially necessary 
to the performance of the highest act 
of which the human mind is capable ; 
even the Avorship of the Father oflights 
and of spirits, in spirit and in truth : 
therefoi-e we consider as obstructions to 
pure worship, all forms which divert the 
attention of the mind from the secret 
ii'.tluence of this unction from the Holy 
One, 1 John, ji. 20, 27. Yet, although 
true worship is not confined to time and 
place, we think it incumbent on Chris- 
tians to meet often together, Heb. x. 
25. in testimony of their dependence on 
the heavenly Father, and for a renewal 
of their spiritual strength : nevertheless, 
in the performance of worship, we dare 
not depend for our acceptance with 
him on a formal repetition of the words 
and experiences of others ; but we be- 
lieve it to be our duty to lay aside the 
activity of the imagination, and to wait 
in silence to have a true sight of our 
condition bestowed upon us ; believing 
even a single sigh (Rom. vii. 24.) arising 
from such a sense of our infirmities, and 
of the need we have of divine help, to 
be more acceptable to God than any 
performances, however specious, which 
originate in the will of man. 

" From what has been said respect- 



ing worship, it follows that the ministry 
we approve must have its origin from 
the same source ; for that which is 
needful for man's own direction, and 
for his acceptance with God, Jer. xxiii. 
30, to 32, must be eminently so.to enable 
him to be helpful to others. Accord- 
ingly we believe that the renewed as- 
sistance of the light and power of Christ 
is indispensably necessary for all true 
ministry; and that this holy influence is 
not at our command, or to be procured 
by study, but is the free gift oi" God to 
chosen and devoted servants. Hence 
arises our testimony against preaching 
for hire, in contradiction to Christ's po- 
sitive command, ' Freely ye have re- 
ceived, freely give,' Matt. x. 8. and 
hence our conscientious refusal to sup- 
port such ministry by tithes, or other 
means. 

" As we dare not encourage any mi 
nistry but that which we believe to 
spring from the influence of the Holy 
Spirit, so neither dare we attempt to 
restrain this influence to persons of any 
condition in life, or to the male sex 
alone ; l)ut, as male and female are one 
in Christ, we allow such of the female 
sex as we believe to be endued with a 
right qualification for the ministry, to 
exercise their gifts for the general edi- 
fication of the church ; and this liberty 
we esteem a peculiar mark of the Gos- 
pel dispensation, as foretold by the pro- 
phet Joel, Joel, ii. 28, 29. and noticed by 
the apostle Peter, Acts, ii. 16, 17. 

" There are two ceremonies in use 
among most professors of the Christian 
name — water-baptism, and what is 
termed the Lord's supper. The first of 
these is generally esteemed the essen- 
tial means of initiation into the church 
of Christ ; and the latter of maintaining 
communion with him. But as we have 
been convinced that nothing short of his 
redeeming power, invariably revealed, 
can set the soul free from the thraldoni 
of sin, by this power alone we believe 
salvation to be affected. We hold, that, 
as there is one Lord and one faith, Eph. 
iv. 5. so his baptism is one, in nature and 
operation ; that nothing short of it can 
make us living membersof his mystical 
body; and that the baptism with water; 
administered by his forerunner John, 
belonged, as the latter confessed, to an 
inferior dispensation, John, iii. 30. 

" With respect to the other rite, we 
believe that communion between Christ 
and his church is not maintained by 
that, nor any other external perform- 
ance, but only by a real participation of 
his divine nature (1 Pet. ii. 4.) through 
faith; that this is the supper alluded to 



QUA 



509 



QUA 



in the Revelation, Rev. vii. 20. ' Behold 
I stand at the door, and knock : if any 
man hear my voice, and open the door, 
I will come in to him, and will sup with 
him, and he with me ;' and that where 
the substance is attained, it is unneces- 
sary to attend to the shadow, which doth 
not confer grace, and concerning which, 
opinions so different, and animosities so 
violent, have arisen. 

" Now, as we thus believe that the 
grace of God, which comes by Jesus 
Christ, is alone sufficient for salvation, 
we can neither admit that it is conferred 
on a few only, whilst others are left 
without it, nor thus asserting its univer- 
sality, can we limit its operation to a 
partial cleansing of the soul from sin, 
even in this life. We entertain worthier 
notions both of the power and goodness 
of our heavenly Father, and believe that 
he doth vouchsafe to assist the obedient 
to experience a total surrender of the 
natural will to the guidance of his pui-e 
unerring Spirit ; through whose renew- 
ed assistance they are enabled to bring 
forth fruits unto holiness, and to stand 
perfect in their present rank. Matt. v. 
48. Eph. iv. 13. Col. iv. 12. 

" There are not many of our tenets 
more generally known than our testi- 
mony against oaths, and against war. 
With respect to the former of these, we 
abide literally by Christ's positive in- 
junction, delivered in his sermon on the 
mount, ' Swear not at all," Matt. v. 34. 
From the same sacred collection of the 
most excellent precepts of moral find 
religious duty, from the example of our 
Lord himself. Matt. v. 39, 44, &amp;c. Matt. 
xxvi. 52, 53. Luke, xxii. 51. John, 
xviii. 11. and from the coiTespondent 
convictions of his Spirit in our hearts, 
we are confirmed in the belief that wars 
and fightings are in their origin and ef- 
fects utterly repugnant to the Gospel, 
which still breathes peace and good- 
will to men. We also are cleai-ly of 
the judgment, that if the ben^olence 
of the Gospel were generally prevalent 
in the minds of men, it would effectually 
prevent them from oppressing, much 
more from enslaving, their, brethren (of 
whatever colour or complexion,) for 
whom, as for themselves, Christ died ; 
and would even influence their conduct 
in their treatment of the brute creation, 
which would no longer groan, the vic- 
tims of their avarice, or of their false 
ideas of pleasure. 

"Some of our ideas have in former 
times, as hath been shown, subjected 
our friends to much suffering fi-om go- 
vernment, though to the salutary pur- 
poses of government our principles are 



a security. They inculcate submission 
to the laws in all cases wherein con- 
science is not violated. But we hold, 
that, as Christ's kingdom is not of this 
world, it is not the business of the civil 
magistrate to interfere in matters of re- 
ligion, but to maintain the external 
peace and good order of the commu- 
nity. We therefore think persecution, 
even in the smallest degree, unwar- 
rantable. We ai'e careful in requiring 
our members not to be concerned in 
illicit trade, nor in any manner to de- 
fraud the revenue. 

"It is well known that the society, 
from its first appearance, has disused 
those names oi the months and days, 
which, "liaving been given in honour of 
the heroes or false gods of the heathen, 
originated in their flattery or supersti- 
tion ; and the custom of speaking to 
a single person in the plural number, as 
having arisen also from motives of adu- 
lation. Compliments, superfluity of ap- 
parel and furniture, outward shows of 
rejoicing and mourning, and the obser- 
vation of days and times, we esteem to 
be incompatible with the simplicity and 
sincerity of a Christian life ; and public 
diversions, gaming, and other vain 
amusements . of the world, we cannot 
but condemn. They are a waste of 
that time which is given us for nobler 
pur])oses ; and divert the attention of 
the mind from the sober' duties of life, 
and from the reproofs of instruction by 
which we are guided to an everlasting 
inheritance. 

" To conclude : although we have 
exhibited the several tenets which dis- 
tinguish our religious society as objects 
of our belief, yet' we are sensible that a 
true and living faith is not produced in 
the mind of man by his own effort, but 
is the free gift of God in Christ Jesus, 
Eph. ii. 8. nourished and increased by 
the progressive operation of his Spirit in 
our hearts, and our proportionate obe- 
dience, John, vii. 17. Therefore, al- 
though for the preservation of the tes- 
timonies given us to bear, and for the 
peace and good order of the society, we 
deem it necessaiy that those who are ad- 
mitted into membership with us should 
be previously convinced of those doc- 
trines which we esteem essential,- yet 
we require no formal subscription to 
any articles, either as a condition of 
membershi]), or a qualification for the 
service of the church. We prefer the 
judging of men bv their fruits, and de- 
pending on the aid of Him, who, by his 
prophet, hath promised to be 'a spirit ot 
judgment, to him that sitteth in judg- 
ment,' Isa. xxviii. 6. Without this, "there

5s a danger of receiving numbers into 
outward communion, without any addi- 
tion to that spiritual sheep-fold, whereof 
our blessed Lord declared himself to be 
both the door and the shepherd, John, 
7. 11 ; that is, such as know his voice 
and follow him in the paths of obedi- 
ence. 

"In the practice of discipline, we 
think it indispensable that the order re- 
commended by Christ himself be ijiva- 
riablv observed, Matt, xviii. 15 — 17. 

" To effect the salutary purposes of 
discipline, meetings were, appointed at 
an early jjeriod of the society, which, 
from the times of their being lield, were 
called quarterly meetings. It was af- 
terwards found expedient to divide the 
districts of those meetings, and to meet 
more frequently: from whence arose 
monthly meetings, subordinate to those 
lield quarterly. At length, in 1669, a 
&gt;'early meeting was established, to su- 
perintend, assist, and provide rides for 
the whole, previously to which general 
meetings had been occasionally lield.- 

"A monthly meeting is usually com- 
posed of several particular congrega- 
tions, situated within a convenient dis- 
tance from each other. Its business is 
to provide for the subsistence of tlic 
poor, and for the education of their off- 
spring ; to judge of the sincerity and fit- 
ness of persons appearing to be con- 
vinced of the religious principles of the 
society, and desiring to be admitted into 
membership ; to excite due attention to 
the discharge of religious and moral 
duty; and to deal with disorderly mem- 
bers. Monthly meetings also grant to 
such of their members as remove into 
other monthly meetuigs certificates of 
their membership and conduct ; with- 
out which they cannot gain member- 
ship in such meetings. Each monthly 
meeting is required to appoint certain 
persons, under the name of overseers, 
who are to take care that the rules of 
bur discipline be put in pi'actice ; and 
when any case ot complaint, or disor- 
derly conduct, comes to their know- 
ledge, to see that private admonition, 
agreeably to the Gospel rule before 
mentioned, be given, previously to its 
being laid before the monthly meeting. 

"When a case is introduced, it is 
usual for a small committee to be ap- 
pouited to visit the offender, to en&lt;1ea- 
vour to convince him of his error, and 
to induce him to forsake and condemn 
it. If they succeed, the person is by 
minute declared to have made satisfac- 
tion for the offence ; if not, he is dis- 
owned as a member of the society. 

"In disputes between individuals, it 



has long been the decided judgment of 
the society, that its members should not 
sue each other at law. It therefore en- 
joins all to end their differences by- 
speedy and impartial arbitration, agree- 
ably to rules laid down. If any refuse 
to adopt this mode, or, having adopted 
it, to submit to the award, it is the di- 
rection of the yearly meeting that such 
be disowned. 

"To monthly meetings also belongs 
the allowing of marriages ; for our so- 
ciety hath always sci'upled to acknow- 
ledge the exclusive authority of the 
pi-iests in the solemnization of marriage. 
Those who intend to marry appear to- 
gether, and propose their intention to 
the monthly meeting ; and if not at- 
tended by their parents and guardians, 
produce a written certificate of their 
consent, signed in the presence of wit- 
nesses. The meeting then appoints a 
committee to inquire whether they be 
clear of other engagements respecting 
marriage ; and if at a subsequent meet- 
ing, to which the parties also come and 
declare the continuance of their inten- 
tion, no objections be reported, they 
have the meeting's consent to solem- 
nize their intended marriage. This is 
done in a public meeting for worship, 
towards the close whereof the pai*ties 
stand up, and solemnly take each other 
for husband and wife. A certificate of 
the proceedings is then publicly read, 
and signed by the parties, and after- 
wards by the relations and others as 
witnesses. Of such marriage the month- 
ly meeting keeps a record ; as also of 
the births and burials of its members. 
A certificate of the date of the name of 
the infant, and of its parents, signed by 
those present at the bii'th, is the sub- 
ject of one of these last-mentioned re- 
cords ; and an order for the interment, 
countersigned by the grave-maker, of 
the other. The naming of children is 
without ceremony. Burials are also con- 
ducted in a simple manner. The body, 
followed by the relations and friends, is 
sometimes, previously to interment, car- 
ried to a meeting ; and at the grave a 
pause is generally made : on both which 
occasions it frequently falls out that one 
or more friends present have somewhat 
to express for the edification of those 
who attend ; but no religious rite is con- 
sidered as an essential part of burial. 

"Several monthly meetings compose 
a quarterly meeting. At the quarterly 
meetings are produced written answers 
from the monthly meetings to certain 
queries respecting the conduct of their 
members, and the meeting's care over 
them.' The accounts thus received are 



QUA 



511 



QUA 



digested into one, which is sent, also in 
the form of answers to queries, by re- 
presentatives to the yearly meeting. 
Appeals from the judgment of monthly 
meetings are brought to the quarterly 
meetings, whose business also it is to 
assist in any difficult case, or where re- 
missness appears in the care of the 
monthly meetings over the individuals 
who compose them. — There are seven 
yearly meetings, viz. I.London, to which 
come representatives from Ireland ; — 
2. New England ; — 3. New York ; — 
4. Pennsylvania and New Jersey ; — 5. 
Maryland ; — 6. Virginia ; — 7. the Caro- 
linas and Georgia. 

" The yearly meeting has the general 
superintendence of the society in the 
country in which it is established ; and, 
therefore, as the accounts which it re- 
ceives discover the state of inferior 
meetings, as particular exigencies re- 
quire, or as the meeting is impressed 
with a sense of duty, it gives forth its 
advice, making such regulations as ap- 
pear to be requisite, or excites to the 
observance of those already made ; and 
sometimes appoints committees to visit 
those quarterly meetings which appear 
to be in need of immediate advice. Ap- 
peals from the judgment of quarterly 
meetings are here finally determined ; 
and a brotherly correspondence, by 
epistles, is maintained with other yearly 
meetings. 

" In this place it is proper to add, that, 
as we believe women may be rightly 
called to the work of the ministry, we 
also think that to them belongs a share 
in the support of our Christian disci- 
pline ; and that some parts of it, where- 
m their own sex is concerned, devolve 
on them with peculiar propriety ; ac- 
cordingly they have monthly, quarterly, 
and yearly meetings of their own sex, 
held at the same time and in the same 
place with those of the men ; but sepa- 
rately, and without the power of makmg 
rules; and it may be remarked, that, 
during the persecutions which in the last 
century occasioned the imprisonment of 
so many of the men, the care of the 

Eoor often fell on the women, and was 
y them satisfactorily administered. 
" In order that those who are in the 
situation of Ministers may have the ten- 
der sympathy and counsel of those of 
either sex, who by their experience in 
the work of religion, are qualified for 
that service, the monthly meetings are 
advised to select such, under the deno- 
mination of elders. These, and minis- 
ters approved by their monthly meet- 
ings, have meetings peculiar to them- 
selves, called meetings of ministers and 



elders ; in which they have an oppor- 
tunity of exciting each other to a dis- 
charge of their several duties, and of 
extending advice to those who may ap- 
pear to be weak, without any needless 
exposure. Such meetings are generally 
held in the compass of each monthly, 
quarterly, and yearly meeting. They 
are conducted by rules prescribed by 
tlie yearly meeting, and have no au- 
thority to make any alteration or addi- 
tion to them. The members of them 
unite with their brethren in the meet- 
ings for discipline, and are equally ac- 
countable to the latter for their conduct. 

" It is to a meeting of this kind in 
London, called the second-day's morn- 
ing meeting, that the revisal of manu- 
scripts concerning our principles, pre- 
viously to publication, is intrusted by the 
yearly meeting held in London ; and 
also the granting, in the intervals of the 
yearly meeting, of certificates of appro- 
bation to such ministers as are concern- 
ed to travel in the work of the minis- 
try in foreign parts, in addition to those 
granted by their monthly and quarterly 
meetings. When a visit of this kind 
doth not extend beyond Great Britain, 
a certificate from the monthly meeting 
of Avhich the minister is a member is 
sufficient ; if to Ireland, the concurren,ce 
of the quarterly meeting is also re- 
quired. . Kegulations of similar tenden- 
cy obtain in other yearly meetings. 

" The yearly meeting of London, in 
the year 1675, appointed a meeting to 
be held in that city, for the purpose of 
advising and assisting in case of suffer- 
ing for conscience-sake, Avhich hath 
continued with great use to tlie society 
to this day. It is composed of friends, 
under the name of correspondents, cho- 
sen by the several quarterly meetings^^ 
and who reside in or near the society.

names of all these correspondents, pre- 
viously to their being recorded as such, 
are submitted to the approbation of the

who are approved ministers are also 
members of this meeting, which is call- 
ed the meeting for sufferings ; a name 
arising from its original puiposc, which 
is not yet become entirely obsolete.

meeting for sufferings with the care of 
printing and distributing books, and with

stances which may occasion an appli- 
cation to government. 

" There is not, in any of the meetings 
which have been mentioned, any presi- 
dent, as we believe that divine wisdom 
alone ought to preside ; nor hath any 
member a right to claim pre-eminence 
over the rest. The office of clerk, with 
a few exceptions, is undertaken volun- 
tarily by some member ; as is also the 
keeping of the records. When these 
are very voluminous, and I'equire a 
house for their deposit, (as is the case in 
London, whei'e the general records of 
the society in Great Britain are kept,) 
a clerk is hired to have the care of them; 
but except a few clerks of this kind, and 
persons who have the care of meet- 
ing-houses, none receive any stipend or 
gratuity for tlieir services in our reli- 
gious society." See a pamphlet enti-

QUIETISTS, a sect famous towards 
the close of the seventh century. They 
were so called from a kind of absolute 
rest and inaction, which they supposed 
the soul to be in when arrived at that 
state of perfection which they called 
the unitive life; in which state they 
imagined the soul wholly employed in 
contemplating its God, to whose influ- 
ence it was entirely submissive, so that 
he could turn and drive it where and 
how he would. 

Molinos, a Spanish priest, is the re- 

fiuted author of Quietism ; though the 
lluminati, in Spain, had certainly 
taught something like it before. Molinos 
had numerous disciples in Italy, Spain, 
France, and the Netherlands.' One of 
the principal patrons and propagators 
of Quietism in France was Marie Bou- 
veres de la Motte Guyon, a woman of 
fashion, and remarkable for her piety. 
Her religious sentiments made a great 
noise in the year 1687, and were de- 
clared unsound by several learned men, 
especially Bossuet, who opposed them 
in the year 1697. Hence arose a con- 
troversv between the prelate last men- 



tioned and Fenelon, archbishop of Cam* 
bray, who seemed disposed to favout 
the system of (iuyon, and who, in 1697, 
published a book containing several of 
her tenets. Fenelon's book, by means 
of Bossuet, was condemned in the year 
1699, by Innocent XII. and the sentence 
of condemnation was read by Fenelon 
himself at Cambray, who exhorted the 
people to respect and obey the papal 
decree. Notwithstanding this seeming 
acquiescence, the archbishop persisted 
to the end of his days in the sentiments, 
which, in obedience to the order of the 
pope, he retracted and condemned in a 
public manner. 

A sect similar to this appeared at 
Mount Athos, in Thessaly, near the end 
of the fourteenth century, called Hesy- 
chasts, meaning the same with Quietists. 
They were a branch of the Mystics, or 
those more perfect monks, who, by long 
and intense contemplation, endeavour- 
ed to arrive at a tranquillity of mind 
free from every degree of tumult arid 
perturbation. 

QUIETNESS, in a moral sense, is 
opposed to disorderly motion, to turbu- 
lencv, to contention, to pragmatical cu- 
riosity, to all such exorbitant behaviour, 
whereby the right of others is infringed, 
their peace disturbed, their just interest 
or welfare any ways prejudiced. It is a 
calm, steady, regular way of proceed- 
ing within the bounds and measures 
prescribed by reason, justice, and chari- 
tv, modesty and sobriety. It is of such 
importance, that we find it enjoined in 
the sacred Scripture ; and we are com- 
manded to study and peruse it with 
the greatest diligence and care, 1 
Thcss. iv. 11. The great Dr. Barrow 
has two admirable sermons on this sub- 
ject in the first volume of his Works. 
He justly obsei'ves, 1. That quietness 
is just and equal. — 2. It indicates hu- 
mility, modesty, and sobriety of mind. — 
3. It is beneficial to the world, preserv- 
ing the general order of things. — i. It 
preserves concord and amity. — 5. It 
begets tranquillity and peace. — 6. It is 
a decent and lovely thing, indicating a 
good disposition, and producing good 
effects. — 7. It adonieth any profession, 
l:&gt;ringing credit and respect thereto. — 8. 
It is a safe practice, keeping us from 
needless encumbrances and hazards: 
whereas, pragmatic^tlness, interfering 
with the business and concerns of others, 
often raises dissensions, invoh'es in guilt, 
injures others, shows our vanity and 
pride, and exposes to continual trouble 
and danger.

QUINTILIANS, a sect that appear- 
ed in Phrygia, about 189; thus called 
from their prophetess Quintilia. In this 
sect the women were admitted to per- 
form the sacerdotal and episcopal func- 
tions. They attributed extraordinary 
gifts to Eve for having first eaten of the 
tree of knowledge ; lold gi-eat things of 
Mar}', the sister of Moses, as having 



been a prophetess, &amp;c. They added, 
that Philip the deacon had four daugh- 
ters, who were all prophetesses, and 
were of their sect. In these assemblies 
it was usual to see the virgins entering 
in white robes, personating prophetess- 
es. The errors of the Quintilians were 
at first looked upon as folly and mad- 
ness; but, as they appeared to gain 
ground, the council of Laodicea, in 320, 
condemned it.

were the same as the Seekers. See

REALISTS, a term made use of to 
denote those Trinitarians who are the 
most orthodox, in opposition to the So- 
cinian and ShiDcUian schemes. It was 
also the name of a sect of school philo- 
sophers, formed in opposition to the 
Nominalists. The former believed that 
universals are realities, and have an 
actual existence out of the mind ; while 
the latter contended that they exist only 
in the mind, and are only ideas. 

REASON, a faculty or power of the 
mind, whereby it draws just conclu-. 
sions from the true and clear princi- 
ples. Many attempts have been made 
to prove reason inimical to revelation ; 
but nothing can be more evident than 
that it is of considerable use in know- 
ing, distinguishing, proving, and de- 
fending the mysteries of revelation ; al- 
though it must not be considered as a 
perfect standard by which all the mys- 
teries of religion must be measured Ije- 
fore they are received by faith. "In 
things," says Dr. Watts, " which are 
plainly and expressly asserted in Scrip- 
tui'e, and that in a sense which contra- 
dicts not other parts of Scripture, or 
natural light, our reason must submit, 
and believe the thing, though it cannot 
find the modus or manner of its being : 



so in thedodtrines of the Trinity and In- 
carnation, which are above the reach of 
our reason in this present state. But we 
cannot, nor must we, be led to take the 
woVds of Scripture in such a sense as 
expressly and evidently contradicts all 
sen^e and reason, as transubstantiation : 
for the two great lights of God, reason 
and revelation, never contradict each 
other, though one be superior to the 
other. 

"Therefore reason has a great deal 
to do in I'cligion, viz. to find out the iTile 
(of faith,) to compare the parts of this 
rule v^'ith one another, to explain the 
one by the other, to give the gramma- 
tical and logical sense of the expres 
sions, and to exclude self-contradictory 
interpretations, as well as. interpreta- 
tions contrary to reason. But it is not 
to set itself up as a judge of those truths 
expressed therein, which are asserted 
by a superior and infallible dictator, 
God himself; but reason requires and 
commands even the subjection of all its 
own powers to a truth tluis divinely at- 
tested ; for it is as possible and as pro- 
per that God should propose doctrines 
to our understanding wliich it cannot 
comprehend, as duties to our practice 
which we cannot see the reason of; for 
he is equally superior to our r.nderstand- 
ing and will, and he puts the obedience 
of both to a trial." bee Religion and

only from all conversation with the i 
world, but even with the house. This is 
a kind of voluntary imprisonment from 
a motive either of devotion or penance. 
RECONCILIATION, the restoring 
to favour or friendship those who were 
at variance. It is more particularly 
used in reference to the doctrine of the 
atonement. Thus God is said to recon- 
cile us to himself by Jesus Christ, 2 Cor. 
V. 18. Our state by nature is that of 
enmity, dissatisfaction, and disobedience. 
But by the sufferings and merit of Christ 
we are reconciled and brought near to 
God. The blessings of reconciliation are 
pardon, peace, friendship, confidence, 
holiness, and eternal life. The judicious 
Guyse gives us an admirable note on 
this doctrine, which I shall here trans- 
cribe. " When the Scripture speaks of 
reconciliation by Chi-ist, or by his cross, 
blood, or death, it is commonly ex- 
pressed by God's reconciling us to him- 
self, and 7iot by his bein_^ reconciled 
unto us ; the reason of which seems to 
be, because God is the offeiided party, 
and we are the offmders, who, as such, 
have need to be reconciled to him : and 
the price of reconciliation, by the blood 
of Christ, is paid to him, and not to us. 
Grotins observes, that, in heathen au- 
thors, men's being reconciled to their 
gods is always understood to signifv ap- 
peasing the anger of their gods. Con- 
demned rebels may be said to be recon- 
ciled to their sovereign, when he, on 
one consideration or another, pardons 
them ; though, perhaps, they still re- 
main rebels in their hearts against him. 
And when our Lord ordered the offend- 
ing to go and be reconciled to his of- 
fended " brother, Matt. v. 23, 24, the 
plain meaning is, that he should go and 
try to appease his anger, obtain his for- 
giveness, and regain his favour and 
friendship, by humblhig himself to him, 
asking his pardon, or satisfying him for 
any injury that he might have done him. 
In like manner, God's recoticiling us to 
himself by the cross of Christ does not 
signify, as the Socinians contend, our 
being reconciled by conversion to a reli- 
gious turn in om- hearts to God, but is a 
reconciliation that results from God's 
graciously providing and accepting an 
atonement for us, that he might not in- 
flict the punishment upon us wliich ^ve 
Reserved, and the law condemned us 
to; but might be at peace with us, and 
receive us. into favour on Christ's ac- 
covmt. For this reconciliation, by the 
cross of Christ is in a way of atonement 
or satisfaction to divine justice for sin ; 
and with respect hereunto, we are said ■ 
to be reconciled to God by the death of 



his Son ifhile nve are enemies, which is 
of much the same import ivith Christ's 
dying for the ungodly, and ivhile we 
were yet sinners, Rom. v. 6, 8, 10. AncI 
our being reconciled to God, by ap- 
proving and accepting of his method of 
reconciliation by Jesus Christ, and, ou 
that encouragement, turning to him, is 
distinguished frona his reconciling us to 
himself and not imputing our tres- 
passes to us, on account of Christ's 
having been made sin for us, that nve 
might be made the righteousness of 
God in him, 2 Cor. v. 18, 21. This is 
called Christ's making reconciliation 
for iniquity, and making reconciliation 
for the sins of the fieofile, Dan. ix. 24. 
Heb. ii. 17, and answers to the ceremo- 
nial and typical reconciliation which was 
made by the blood of the sacrifices un- 
der the law to make atonement and re- 
conciliation for Israel, 2 Chron. xxix. 
24. Ezek. xlv. 15, 17, and which was 
frequently styled making atonement for 
sin, and afi atonernent for their souls. 
Now as all the legal sacrifices of atone- 
ment, and the truly expiatoiy sacrifices 
of Christ, were offered not to the of- 
fenders, but to God, to reconcile him to 
tliem, what can reconciliation by the 
dec It, blood, or cross of Christ mean, 
but diat the law and justice of God were 
thereby satisfied, and all obstructions, 
on his part, to peace and friendship to- 
ward sinners are removed, that he might 
not pursue his righteous demands upon 
them, accoi'ding to tlie holy resentments 
of liis nature and will, and the threaten- 
ings of his huv for their -sins ; but might 
mercifully forgive them, and take them 
into a state of favour with himself, 
upon their receiving the atonement, or 
{xalaKKrx'yrw) reconciliation (Rom. v. 11,) 
by faith, after the offence that sin had 
given him, and the breach it had made 
upon the original friendship between 
him and them ?" See articles Atone- 
ment, Mediator, and Propitia- 
tion; Grot, de Satisf. cap. 7; Dr.

RECTITUDE, or Uprightness, is 
the choosing and pursuing those things 
which the mind, upon due inquiry and 
attention, clearly jjerceives to be good, 
and avoiding those that are evil. 

RECTOR, a term applied to several 
persons whose offices are very different, 
as, 1. The rector of a parish is a clergy- 
man that has the charge atid care of a 
parish, and possesses all the tithes, 8cc. 
— 2. The same name is also given to the 
chief elective officer in several foreign

universities, and also to the liead mas- 
ter of large schools. — 3. Rector is also 
used in several convents for the supe- 
rior officer who governs the house. The 
Jesuits gave this name to the superiors 
of such of their houses as were either 
seminaries or colleges. 

RECUSANTS, such persons -as ac- 
knowledge the pope to be the supreme 
head of the church, and refuse to ac- 
knowledge the king's supremacy ; who 
are hc'nce called popish recusants. 

REDEMPTION,;n theology, denotes 
our recovery from sin and death by the 
obedience and sacrifice of Christ, who, 
on this account, is called The Redetinci\ 
Isaiah lix. 20. Job xix. 25. Our Eng- 
lish word redemfition, says Dr. Gill, is 
fi'om the Latin tongile, and signifies 
buying again ; and several words, in the 
Greek, language of the New Testa- 
ment, are used in the affair of our re- 
demption, which signify the obtaining of 
something by paying a proper price for 
it : sometimes the simple verb ayoja^co, 
to buy, is used : so the redeemed are 
said to be bought unto God by the blood 
of Christ, and to be bought from the 
earth, and to be bought from among 
men, and to be bought with a price ; 
that is, with the price of C^hrist's blood, 
1 Cor. vi. 20. Hence the church of 
God is said to be purchased with it, 
Acts XX. 28. Sometimes the compound 
word £?a7oja{u is used ; which signifies 
to buy again, or out of the hands of ano- 
ther, as the redeemed are bought out of 
the hands of justice, as in Gal. iii. 13. 
and Gal. iv. 5. In other places, autjov 
is used, or others derived from it, which 
signifies the deliverance of a slave or 
captive from thraldom, by paying a ran- 
som price for him: .so the saints are 
said to be redeemed not with silver or 
gold, the usual price paid for a ransom, 
but with a far greater one, the blood 
and life of Christ, which he came into 
this world to give as a ransom price 
for many, and even himself, which is 
avTi\uTjov, an answerable, adequate, and 
full price for them, 1 Pet. i. 18. The 
evils from which we are redeemed or 
delivered are the curse of the law, sin, 
Satan, the world, death, and hell. The 
moving- cause of redemption is the love 
of God, John iii. 16. The firocuring- 
cause, Jesus Christ, 1 Pet. i. 18, 19. 
The ends of redemption are, that tlie 
justice of God might be satisfied ; his 
people reconciled, adopted, sanctified, 
and brought to glory. The properties 
of it are these : 1. It is agreeable to all 
the perfections of God. — 2. What a crea- 
ture n-^ver could obtain, and therefore 
entirely of free grace. — 3. It is special 



and particular. — 4. Full and complete. — 
And, 5, lastly. It is eternal as to its 
blessings. See articles Propitiation,

REFORMATION, in general, an 
act of reforming or correcting an error 
or abuse in religion, discipline, or the 
like. By way of eminence, the word is 
used for that great alteration and re- 
formation in the corrupted system of 
Christianity, begun by Luther in the 
year 1517. 

Before the period of the reforma- 
tion, the pope had in the most audacious 
manner declared himself the sovereign 
of the whole world. Ail the parts of it 
which were inhabited by those who were 
not Christians, he accounted to be inha-^ 
bited by nobody; and if Christians took 
it into their heads to possess any of those 
countries, he gave them full liberty to 
make war upon the inhabitants without 
any provocation, and to treat them with 
no more humanity than they would have 
treated wild beasts. Tlie countries, if 
conquered, were to be parcelled out ac- 
cording 10 the pope's pleasure ; and 
dreadful was the situation of that prince 
who refused to obey the will of the holy 
pontiff. In consequence of this extra- 
ordinary authority which the pope had 
assumed, he at last granted to the king 
of Poitugal all the countries to the east- 
ward of Cape Non in Africa, and to the 
king of Spain all the countries to the 
westv/ai'd of it. In this was completed 
in his person the character of Antichrist 
sitting in the temple of God, and show- 
ing himself as God. He had long be- 
fore-assumed the supremacy belonging 
to the Deity himself in spiritual mat- 
ters; and now he assumed the same 
supremacy in worldly matters also, 
giving the extreme regions of the earth 
to whom he pleased. 

Every thing was quiet, every heretic 
exterminated, and the whole Christian 
world supinely acquiesced in the enor- 
mous absurdities which were inculcated 
upon them ; when, in 1517, tlie empire 
of superstition began to decline, and has 
continued to do so ever since. The per- 
son who made the first attack on the 
extravagant superstitions then pi-evail- 
ing was Martin Luther, the occasion of 
which is fully related under the article 
Lutherans. 

The reformation began in the city of 
Wittemberg, in Saxony, but was'noy

long confined either to that city or pro- 
vince. In 1520, the Franciscan fnars, 
who had the care of promulgating in- 
dulgences in Switzerland, were opposed 
by Zuinglius, a man not inferior in un- 
derstanding and knowledge to Luther 
himself. He proceeded with the great- 
est \ igour, even at the very beginning, 
to overturn the whole fabric of popery; 
but his opinions v/ere declared erro- 
neous by the vuiiversities of Cologne and 
Lou-i ain. Notwithstanding this, the ma- 
gistrates of Zurich approved of his pro- 
ceedings ; and that whole canton, to- 
gether, with those of Bern, Basil, and 
ChafTausen, embraced his opinions. 

In Germany, Luther continued to 
make great advances, without being in 
the least intimidated by the ecclesiasti- 
cal censui'es which were thundered 
against him from all quarters, he being 
continually protected by the German 
princes, either from religious or politi- 
cal motives, so that his adversaries 
could not accomplish his destruction, as 
they had done that of others. Melanc- 
thon, Carlostadius, and other men of 
eminence, also greatly forwarded the 
work of Luther ; and in all pi-oljability 
the popish hierarchy would have soon 
come to an end, in the' northern parts of 
Europe at least, had not the emperor 
Charles V. giAen a severe check to the 
jjrogi'ess of reformation in Germany. 

During the confinement of Luther in 
a castle near \\"arburg, the reformation 
advanced rapidly; almost every city in 
Saxony embracing the Lutheran opi- 
nions. At this time an alteration in the 
established forms of v.'orship was first 
ventured upon at Wittemberg, by abo- 
lishing the celebration of private masses, 
and by giving the cup as well as the 
bread to the laity in the Lord's supper. 
In a short time, however, the new opi- 
nions Avere condemned by the university 
of Pai-is, and a refutation of them was 
attempted by Henry VIII. of England. 
But Luther was not to be thus intimi- 
dated. He published his animadver- 
sions on both with as much acrimony as 
if he had been refuting the meanest ad- 
versary ; and a conti'oversy managed by 
such illustrious antagonists drew a ge- 
neral attention, and the reformers daily 
gained new converts both in France 
and England. 

But while the efforts of Luther were 
thus e\'ery AVhere crowned with success, 
the divisions began to prevail which 
have since so much agitated the reform- 
ed churches. — The fii-st dispute was be- 
tween Luther and Zuinglius concerning 
the manner in which the body and blood 
of Christ were present in the eucharist. 



Both parties maintained theiv tenets 
with the utmost obstinacy; and, by their 
divisions, first gave their adversaries an 
argument against them, Avhich to this 
day the Catholics urge with great force ; 
namely, that the Protestants are so di- 
vided, that it is impossible to know who 
are right or wrong ; and that there 
cannot be a stronger proof than these di- 
visions that the whole doctrine is false. 
To these intestine divisions were added 
the horrors of a civil war, occasioned by 
oppression on the one hand, and en- 
thusiasm on the other. See Anabap- 
tists. 

■ These proceedings, however, were 
checked. Luther and Melancthon were 
ordered by the elector of Saxony to 
draw up a body of laws relating to the 
form of ecclesiastical government, the 
method of public worship, &amp;c. which 
was to be proclaimed by heralds through- 
out his dominions. He, with Melanc- 
thon, had translated part of the New 
Testament in 1522 ; on the reading of 
which the' people were astonished to 
find how different the laws of Christ 
were to those which thev had imposed 
by the ]iope, and to wliich they had 
been subject. The pi'inces and the 
people saw that Luther's opinions were 
founded on truth. They openly re- 
nounced the papal supremacy, and the 
happy morn of the reiomiation was wel- 
comed by those who had long sat in su- 
perstitious darkness. 

This open resolution so exasperated 
the patrons of popery, that they intended 
to make war on the Lutherans, who 
prepared for defence. In 1526, a diet 
was assembled at Spire, when the em- 
peror's ambassadors were desired to 
use their utmost endeavours to suppress 
all disputes about religion, and to insist 
upon the rigorous execution of the 
sentence which had been pronounced 
against liUther at Worms. But this 
opinion was opposed, and the diet proved 
favourable to the reformation. But this 
i tranquillity, which they in consequence 
enjoyed, did not last long. In I- 39, a 
new diet was formed, and the power 
which had been gi-anted to princes of 
managing ecclesiastical affairs till the 
meeting of a general council, was now 
revoked, and every change declared 
unlav/ful that should be introduced into 
the doctrine, discij)line, or worship of 
the established religion, before the de- 
termination of the approaching council 
was known. This decree was consider- 
ed as iniquitous and intolerable by se- 
veral members of the diet; and when 
they found that all their arguments and 
remonstrances were in vain, they en-

tered a solemn protest against the de- 
cree on the 19th of April, and appealed 
to the emperor and a future council. 
Hence arose the denomination of Pro- 
testantH, which from that time has been 
'gnen to those who separate fi'om the 
church of Rome. 

Charles V. was in Italy, to whom the 
dissenting princes sent ambasadors to 
lay their grievances before him ; but 
thev met with no encouraging reception 
from him. The pope and the emperor 
were in close union at this time, and they 
had interviews upon the business. The 
pope thought the emperor to be too cle- 
ment, and alleged that it v/as his duty 
to execute vengeance upon the heretical 
faction. To this, however, the empe- 
ror paid no regard, looking spon it as 
imjust to condemn, unheard, a set of 
men who had always approved them- 
selves good citizens The emperor, 
therefore, set out for Germany, having 
already appointed a diet of the empire 
to be held at Augsburg, whei'e he ar- 
rived, and found there a' full assembly 
of the members of the diet. Here the 
gentle and pacific Melancthon had been 
ordered to draw up a confession of their 
faith, which he did, and expressed his 
sentiments and doctrine with the great- 
est elegance and perspicuity ; and thus 
came forth to view the famous confession 
of jiugsbiirg. 

This was attempted to be refiited by 
the divines of the church of Rome, and 
a controversy took place, which the 
emperor endeavoured to reconcile, but 
Avithout success ; all hopes of bringing 
about a coalition seemed utterly despe- 
• rate. The votaries of the cliurch of 
Rome, therefore, had recourse to the 
powerful arguments of imperial edicts 
and the force of the secular arm ; and, 
on the 19th of November, a decree was 
issued by the emperor's orders every 
way injurious to the reformers. Upon 
which they assembled at Smalcald, 
where they concluded a league of mu- 
tual defence against all aggressors, by 
which they formed the Protestant states 
into one body, and resolved to apply to 
the kings of France and England to im- 
plore them to pati'onize their new con- 
tederacy. The king of France, being 
the avowed rival o^ the emperor, de- 
termined secretly to cherish those 
sparks of political discord; arid the 
king of England, highly incensed against 
Charles, in complaisance to whom the 

f)ope had long retarded, and now open- 
y opposed, his long solicited divorce, 
was equally disposed to strengthen a 
league which might be rendei'ed formi- 
dable to the emperor. Being, however^ 



so taken up with the scheme of divorce, 
and of abolishing the papal jurisdiction 
in England, he had b\it little leisure to 
attend to them. Meanwhile Charles 
was convinced that it was not a time to 
extirpate hei'csy by violence ; and at 
last terms of pacification were agreed 
upon at Nuremberg, and ratified so- 
lemnly in the diet at Ratisbon : and af- 
fairs so ordered by Di\^ne Providence, 
that the Protestants obtained terms 
which amounted almost to a toleratioH 
of their religion. 

Soon after the conclusion of the peace 
at Nuremburg, died John, elector of 
Saxony, who was succeeded by his son 
John Frederic, a prince of invincible 
fortitude and magnanimit}^, but whose 
reign was little better than one con- 
tinued train of disappointments and 
calamities. Tlie religious truce, how- 
ever, gave new \'igour to the reforma- 
tion. Those who had hitherto been on- 
ly secret enemies to the Roman pontiff, 
now publicly threw off his yoke ; and 
various cities and provjpces of Ger- 
many enlisted themselves under the re- 
ligious standards of Luther. On the 
other hand, as the emperor had now no 
other hope of terminating the religious 
disputes but by the meetijig of a general 
council, he repeated his reouests to the 
pope for" that purpose. The pontiff 
(Clement VH.) whom the history of 
past councils filled with the greatest 
uneasiness, endeavoured to retard what 
he could not with decency refuse. At 
last, in 1533, he made a proposal by his 
j legate, to assemble a council at Mantua, 
Placentia, or Bologna ; but the Pro- 
testants refused their consent to the no- 
mination of an Italian council, and in- 
sisted that a controversy which had its 
rise in the heart of Germany should be 
determined within the limits of the em- 
pire. The pope, by his usual artifices, 
eluded the performance of his own pro- 
mise ; and in 1534, was cut off bv death, 
in the midst of his stratagem. His suc- 
cessor Paul III. seemed to show less re- 
luctance to the assembling a general 
council, and, in the year 1535, expressed 
his inclination to convoke one at Man- 
tua ; and, in the year following, actual- 
ly sent circular letters for that purpose 
thi'ough all the states and kingdoms un- 
der his jurisdiction. This council was 
summoned by a bull issued out on the 
second of June 1536, to meet at Man- 
tua the following year .- but several ob- 
stacles prevented its meeting ; one of 
the most material of whicii was, that 
Frederic duke of Mantua had no.incli- 
nation to receive at once so many guests, 
some of them -^'ery turbuleutj into the

place of his residence. On the other 
hand, the Protestants were firmly per- 
suaded, that, as the council was assem- 
bled in Italy, and by the authority of the 
pope alone, the latter must have had an 
undue influence in that assembly; of 
consequence that all things must have 
been carried by the votaries of Rome. 
For this reason they assembled at Smal- 
eald in the ye* 1537, where they so- 
lemnly protested against this partial atid 
coriTjpt council ; and, at the same time, 
liad a new summary of their doctrine 
drawn up by Luther, in order to pre- 
sent it to the assembled bisliops, if it 
should be required of them. This sum- 
mary, which had the title of The Arti- 
cles of Smalcald, is conmioniy joined 
with the creeds and confessions of the 
Lutheran chuixh. 

After the meeting of the general 
council in Mantua was thus prevented, 
many schemes of accommodation were 

I)roposed both b}^ the emperor and the 
^rotcstants; but,' by the artifices of the 
chuixh of Rome, all of them came to 
nothing. In ]5^1, the emperor appointed 
a meeting at Worms on the subject of 
religion, between persons of piety and 
learning, chosen from the contending 
parties. This conference, however, 
was,.for certain reasons, removed to the 
diet that was to be held at Ratisbon the 
same year, and in which the principal 
subject of deliberation waS a memorial 
presented by a person unknown, con- 
taining a project of peace. But the 
conference produced no other effect 
Ihan a mutual agreement of the con- 
tending parties to refer their matters to 
a general council, or, if the meeting of 
such a council should be prevented, to 
the next German diet. 

The i-esolution was rendered ineffec- 
tual by a variety of incidents, which 
widened the breach, and put off to a 
farther day the deliberations which 
were designed to heal it. The pope or- 
dered his legate to declare to the diet 
of Spire, assembled in 1542, that he 
would, according to the promise he had 
already made, assemble a general coun- 
cil, and that Trent should be the place 
of its meeting, if the diet had no ob- 
jection to that city. Ferdinand, and the 
pnnces who adhered to the cause of the 
]&gt;ope, gave their consent to this propo- 
sal ; but it was vehemently objected to 
by the Protestants, both because the 
council was summoned by the authority 
of the pope only, and also because ihe 
place was within the jurisdiction of tlie 
pope ; whereas they desired a free 
council, which should not be biassed by 
the dictates nor awed by the proximity 



of the pontiff. But this, protestation 
produced no effect. Paul IIL persisted 
in his purpose, and issued out his cir- 
cular letters for the convocation of the 
council, with the approbation of the em- 
peror. In ju.stice to this pontiff, lioAt-* 
ever, it must be observed,.that he show- 
ed himself not to be averse to every 
reformation. He appointed four cardi- 
nals, and three other persons eminent 
for their learning, to draw up a plan for 
the i-eformation of the church m gene- 
ral, and of the church of Rome in par- 
ticular, 'lihe reformation proposed hi 
this plan was, indeed, extremely super- 
ficial and partial ; yet it contained some 
particulars which could scarcely have 
been expected from those who com- 
posed it. 

All this time the emperor had been 
labouring to persuade the Protestants 
to consent to the meeting of the coun- 
cil at Trent ; but, when he fomid them 
fixed in their opposition to this mea- 
sure, he began to listen to the sanguinary 
measures of the pope, and resolved to 
terminate the disputes by force of arms. 
The elector of Saxony and landgrave 
of Hesse, who were the chief supporters 
of the Protestant cause, upon this, took 
proper measures to prevent their being 
surprised and overwhelmed by a su- 
I)erior force ; but, before the hori-ors of 
war commenced, the gi'eat reformer 
Luther died in peace at Ayselben, the 
place of his nativity, in 1546. 

The emperor and the pope had mu- 
tually resolved on the destruction of all 
who should dare to oppose the council 
of Trent. The meeting of it was to 
serve as a signal for taking up arms ; , 
and accordingly its deliberations were 
scarcely begun, in 1546, when the Pro- 
testants perceived undoubted signs of 
the approaching storm, and a formida- 
ble union betvi'ixt the emperor and the 
pope, which threatened to crush and 
overwhelm them at once. This year, 
indeed, there had been a new confereiice 
at Ratisl)on upon the old subject of ac- 
commodating differences in religion; 
but, from the manner in which the de- 
btites were carried on, it plainly ap- 
peared that these differences could on- 
ly be decided in the field of battle. The 
council of Trent, in the mean time, pro.- 
mulgated their decrees ; while the re- 
formed princes, in the diet of Ratisbon, 
protested against their authority, and 
were on that account proscribed by the 
emperor, who raised an army to reduce 
them to obedience. 

The elector of Saxony and the land- 
grave of Hesse led their forces into Ba- 
varia against the emperor, and cannona*

ded his camp in Ingoldstadt. It was 
supposed that this would bring on an 
engagement, Avhich would probably 
have been advantageous to the cause of 
the reformed ; but this was prevented 
chiefly by the pei-fidy of Maurice, duke 
of Saxony, who invaded the dominions 
of his uncle. Divisions were also fo- 
mented among the confederate princes 
by the dissimulation of the emperor; 
and France failed in paying the subsidy 
which had been promised l;y its mo- 
narch ; all which so discouraged the 
heads of the Protestant party, that their 
army soon dispersed, and the elector of 
Saxony was obliged to direct his march 
homewards. But he was pursued by 
the emperor, who made several forced 
marches with a view to destroy his 
enemy before he should have time to 
recover his vigour. The two armies 
met near Muhlberg, on the Elbe, on the 
24th of April, 1547 ; and, after a bloody 
action, the elector was entirely defeat- 
ed, and himself taken prisoner. Mau- 
rice, who had so basely betrayed him, 
was now declared electftr of Saxony ; 
and, by his entreaties, Philip, landgrave 
of Hesse, the other chief of the Pro- 
testants, was persuaded to throw him- 
self on the mei:cy of the emperor, and 
to implore his pardon. To this he con- 
sented, relying on the promise of Charles 
for obtaining forgiveness, and being re- 
stored to liberty ; but, notwithstanding 
these expectations, he was unjustly de- 
tained prisoner, by a scandalous viola- 
tion of the most solemn convention. 

The affairs of tlie Protestants now 
seemed to be desperate. In the. diet of 
Augsburg, which was soon after called, 
the empei'or required the Protestants 
to leave the decision of these religious 
disputes to the wisdom of the council 
which was to meet at Trent. The 
greatest part of the members consented 
to this proposal, being convinced by the 
powerful argument of an imperial ai'- 
my, which was at hand to dispel the 
darkness from the eyes of such as might 
otherwise have been blind to the force 
of Charles's reasoning. However, thi 
general submission did not produce the 
effect which was expected from it. A 
plague which broke out, or was said to 
do so, in the city, caused the greatest 

Eart of the bishops to I'etire to Bologna, 
y which means the council was in ef- 
fect dissolved ; nor could all the en- 
treaties and remonstrances of the em- 
peror prevail upon the pope to re-as- 
semble it without delay. During this 
interval, therefore, the emperor judged 
it necessary to fall upon some method 
of accommodating the religious differ- 



ences, and maintaining peace until the 
council so long expected should be 
finally obtained. Witli this view he or- 
dered Julius Pelugius, bishop of Naum- 
berg, Michael Sidonius, a creature of 
the pope, and John Agricola, a native of 
AvselbcTi, to draw up a formulary which 
might serve as a rule of faith and wor- 
ship till the council should be assembled ; 
but as this was only a temporary expe- 
dient, and had not the force of a per- 
manent or perpetual institution, it 
thence obtained the name of the In- 
ter im. 

This project of Charles was formed 
parth' with a design to vent his resent- 
ment against the pope, and pai'tly to an- 
swer other political purposes. It con- 
tained all the essential doctrines of the 
church of Rome, though considerably 
softened by the artful terms which 
were employed, and which were quite 
different from those employed before 
and after this period by the council of 
Trent. There was even an affected 
ambiguity in many of the expressions, 
which made them'susceptible of diffei-- 
ent senses, and applicable to the senti- 
ments of both communions. The con- 
sequence of all this was, that the impe- 
rial creed was reprobated by both" par- 
tics. [Sec Interim.] In the year 1542, 
the pope (Paul III.) died ; and was suc- 
ceeded by Julius III. who, at the re- 
peated solicitations of the emperor, con- 
sented to the re-assembling of a coun- 
cil of Trent. A diet was again held at 
Augsburg, under the cannon of tlie im- 
perial army, and Charles laid the mat- 
ter before the princes of the empire. 
Most of those present gave t"lieir con- 
sent to it, and, among the rest, Maurice 
elector of Saxony ; who consented on 
the following conditions: 1. That the 

Eoints of doctrine which had already 
een decided there should be re-ex- 
amined. — 2. That this examination 
should be made in presence of the Pro- 
testant divines. — 3. That the Saxon 
Protestants should have a Jibci'ty of 
voting as well as of deliberating in the 
council. — 4. That the pope should not 
pretend to preside in the assembly, 
either in person or by his legates. _ This 
declaration of Maurice was read in tiic 
diet, and his deputies insisted uponits 
being entered into the registers, which 
the archbishop of Mentz obstinately re- 
fused. The diet was concluded in 1551 ; 
and, at its breaking up, the emperor de- 
sired the assembled princes and states 
to prepare all things for the approach- 
ing council, and promised to use his ut- 
most endeavours to procure modera- 
tion and harmony, impartiality and cha-

rity, in the transactions of that as- 
sembly. 

On the breaking up of the diet, the 
Pi'otestants took such steps as they 
thought most properfortheirown safety. 
The Saxons employed Melancthon, and 
the Wirtembergers Brensjiiis, to draw 
up confessions of faith to be laid before 
the new council. The Saxon divines, 
however, proceeded no farther than 
Nuremberg, having received secret 
orders from Maurice to stop there ; for 
the elector perceiving that Charles had 
formed designs against the liberties of 
the German princes, resolved to take 
the most effectual measures for crush- 
ing his ambition at once. He therefoi-e 
entered with the utmost secrecy and 
expedition into an alliance with the king 
of France and several of the German 
princes, for the security of the rights 
and liberties of the empire ; after which, 
assembling a powerful armv in 1552, he 
marched against the emperor, who lay 
■with a handful of troops at Inspruck, 
and expected no such thing. By this 
sudden and unforeseen accident, Charles 
was so much dispirited, that he was 
willing to make peace almost on any 
terms. The consequence of this was, 
that* he concluded a ti-eaty at Passau,. 
which by the Protestants is considered 
as the basis of their religious liberty. 
By the first three articles of this treaty 
it was agreed that Maurice and the 
confederates should lay down their arms, 
and lend their troops to Ferdinand, to 
assist him against the Turks ; and that 
the landgrave of Hesse should be set at 
liberty. By the fourth it was agreed 
that the rule of faith called the Interim 
should be considered as null and void ; 
that the contending parties should en- 
joy the free and undisturbed exercise 
of their religion until a diet should 
be assembled to determine amicably 
the present disputes (which diet was 
to meet in the space of six months;) 
and that this religious libeity should 
continue ^always, in case it should be 
found impossible to come to a uni- 
formity in doctrine and worship. It 
was also determined, that all those who 
had suffered banishment or any other 
calamity, on account of their having 
been concerned in the league or war of 
Smalcald, should be reinstated in their 
privileges, possessions, and employ- 
ments; that the impei'ial chamber at 
Spire should be open to the Protestants 
as well as to the Catholics ; and tliat 
there should always be a certain num- 
ber of Lutlierans in that high court. 
To this peace Albert, marquis of Bran- 
denburg; refused to subscribe ; and con- 



tinued the war against the Roman Ca- 
tholics, committed such ravages in the 
empire, that a confederacy was at last 
foj-med against him. At" the head of 
this confederacy was Maurice, elector 
of Saxony, who died of a wound he. re- 
ceived in a battle fought on the occa- 
sion in 1553. 

The assembly of the diet promised by 
Charles was prevented by various ac- 
cidents ; however, it met at Augsburg, 
in 1555, where it was opened by Ferdi- 
nand in the name of the empei'or, and 
terminated those deplorable calamities 
which had so long desolated the empire. 
After various debates the following acts 
were passed on the twenty-fifth of Sep- 
tember : — That the Protestants who 
followed the confession of Augsburg 
should be for the future considered as 
entirely free from the jurisdiction of the ■ 
Roman pontiff and from the authority 
and superintendence of tlie bishops ; 
that they wei'c left at perfect liberty to 
enact laws for themselves relating to 
their religious sentiments, discipline, and 
worship ; tha* ;dl the inhabitants of the 
German empire should be allowed to 
judge for themselves in religious mat- 
ters, and to join themselves to that 
church whose doctrine and worship 
they thought the most pure and conso- 
nant to the spirit of true Christianity ; 
and that all those who should injure or 
prosecute any person under religious 
pretences, and on account of their opi- 
nions, should be declared and proceeded 
against as public enemies of the empire, 
invaders of its liberty, and disturbers of 
its peace. 

Thus was the reformation established 
in many parts of the German empire, 
where it continues to this day ; nor have 
the efforts of the popish powers at vcaY 
time "been able to suppress it, or even to 
prevent its gaining ground. It was not, 
howe\er, in Germany alone that a re- 
formation of religion took place. Al- 
most all the kingdoms of Europe began 
to open their eyes to the truth about the 
same time. The reformed religion was 
propagated in Sweden, soon after Lu- 
ther's rupture with the church of Rome, 
by one of his disciples named Olaua 
Patri. The zealous efforts of this mis- 
sionary were seconded by Gustavus 
Vasa, whom the Swedes had raised to 
the throne in the place of Christiern, 
king of Denmark, whose horrid bar- 
barity lost him the crown. This prince, 
however, was as prudent as he was 
zealous; and, as the minds of the 
Swedes were in a fluctuating state, he 
wisely avoided all kinds of vehemence 
and precipitation in spreading the new.

doctrine. Accordingly the first object 
of his attention was the instruction of 
his people in the sacred doctrines of the 
holy Scriptures ; for which purpose he 
invited into his dominions several learn- 
ed Germans, and spread abroad through 
the kingdom the Swedish translation of 
the Bible that had been made by Olaus 
Petri. Some time after this, in 1526, he 
appointed a conference at Upsal, be- 
tween the reformer and Peter Gallius, 
a zealous defender of the ancient supei-- 
stition, in which each of the champions 
was to bring forth his arguments, that 
it might be seen on which side the truth 
lay. In this dispute Olaus obtained a 
signal victory ; which contributed much 
to confirm Gustavus in his persuasion of 
the truth of Luther's doctrine, and to 
promote its progi-ess in Sweden. The 
following year another event gave the 
finishing stroke to its propagation and 
success. This was the assembly of the 
states at Westeraas, where Gustavus 
recommended the doctrine of the re- 
formers with such zeal, that after warm 
debates, fomented by the clergy in ge- 
neral, it was unanimously resolved 
that the reformation introduced by Lu- 
ther should have place in Sweden. 
This resolution was principally owing 
to the firmness and magnanimity of 
Gustavus, who declared publicly, that 
he would lay down the sceptre, and re- 
tire fi-om tJie kingdom, rather than rule 
a people enslaved by the orders and au- 
thority of the pope, and more controlled 
by the tyranny of their bishops than by 
the laws of their monarchs. From this 
time the papal empire in Sweden was 
entirely overthrown, and Gustavus de- 
clared head of the church. 

In Dcnviark, the reformation was in- 
troduced as early as the year 1521, in 
consequence of the ardent desire dis- 
covered by Christiern 11, of havinp; his 
subjects instructed in the doctrines of 
Luther. This monarch, notwithstanding 
his cruelty, for which his name has been 
rendered odious, was nevertheless desi- 
rous of delivering his dominions from 
the tyranny of the church of Rome. For 
this purpose, in the year 1520, he sent 
for Martin Reinard, one of the disciples 
of Carlostadt, out of Saxony, and ap- 
pointed him professor of divinity at 
Hasnia ; and after his death which hap- 
pened in 1521, he invited Carlostadt 
himself to fill that in&gt;portant place. 
Carlostadt accepted of this office, in- 
deed, but in a short time returned to 
Germany ; upon which Christiern used 
his utmost endeavours to engage Lu- 
ther to visit his dominions, but in vain. 
However, the progress of Christiern in 



reforming the religion of his subjects, 
or rather of advancing his own power, 
above that of the church, was checked, 
in the year 1523, by a conspiracy, by 
which he was deposed and banished; 
his uncle Frederic, duke of Holstein 
and Sleswic, being appointed his suc- 
cessor. 

Frederic conducted the reformation 
with much greater prudence than his 
predecessoi". He permitted the Pro- 
testant doctors to preach publicly the 
sentiments of Luther, but did not ven- 
ture to change the established govern- 
ment and discipline of the church. 
However, he contributed greatly to the 
progi-ess of the reformation by his suc- 
cessful attem.pts in favour of religious 
liberty in an assembly of the states held 
at Odensee in 1527. Here he procured 
the publication of a famous edict, by 
which every subject of Denmark was 
declared free either to adhere to the te- 
nets of the church of Rome, or to the 
doctrine of Luther. The papal tyran- 
ny was totally destroyed by his succes- 
sor Christiern IIL He began by sup- 
pressing the despotic authority of the 
bishops, and restoring to their lawful 
owners a great part of the wealth and 
possessions which the church had ac- 
quired by various stratagems. This was 
followed by a plan of religious doctrine, 
worship, and discipline, laid down by 
Bugenhagius, whom the king had sent 
for from Wittemberg for that purpose ; 
and in 1539, an assembly of the states at 
Odensee gave a solemn sanction to all 
these transactions. 

In France, also, the reformation be- 
gan to make some pi-ogress very early. 
Margaret, queen ot Isavarre, sister to 
Francis I. the perpetual rival of Charles 
V. was a great friend to the new doc- 
trine ; and it appears that, as early as 
the year 1523, there were in several of 
the provinces of France great numbers 
of people who had conceived the 
greatest avers'^on both to the doctrine 
and tyranny of the church of Rome; 
among whom were many of the first 
rank and dignity, and even some of the 
episcopal order. But as their number 
increased daily, and troubles and com- 
motions were excited in several places 
on account of the religious differences, 
the authority of the king intervened, 
and many persons emnient for their vir- 
tue and piety were put to death in the 
most barbarous manner. Indeed, Fran- 
! cis, who had either no religion at all, or, 
i at best, no fixed and consistent system 
of religious principles, conducted him- 
self towards the Protestants in such a 
manner as best answered his private

views. Sometimes he resolved to invite 
Melancthon into France, probahly witli 
a view to please his sister, the queen of 
Navarre, Avhom he loved tenderly, and 
who had strongly imbibed the Protes- 
tant principles' At other times he ex- 
ercised the most infernal cruelty to- 
wards the reformed ; and once made 
the following- mad declaration. That, 
if he thought the blood of his arm was 
tainted by the Lutheran heresy, he 
-would have it cut off; and that he would 
not even spare his own children, if they 
entertained sentiments contrary to those 
of the Catholic church. 

About this time the famous Calvin 
began to draw the attention of the pub- 
lic, but more especially of the queen of 
Navarre. His zeal exposed him to 
danger ; and the friends of the re- 
formation, whom Fi-ancis was daily 
committing to the flames, placed him 
more than once in the most perilous 
situation, from which he was delivered 
by the intei-position of the queen of 
Navarre. He therefore retired ovit of 
France to Basil, in Switzerland, where 
he published his Christian Institutions, 
and became afterwards so famous. 

Those among the French who first 
renounced the jurisdiction of the Ro- 
mish church are commonly called Lu- 
therans by the writers of those early 
times ; hence it has been supjiosed that 
they had all imbibed the peculiar senti- 
ments of Luther. But this appears by 
no means to have been the case ; for the 
vicinity of the cities of Geneva, Lau- 
sanne, Sec. which had adopted the doc- 
trines of Cah in, produced a remarka- 
ble effect upon the French I'rotestant 
churches ; insomuch that, about the 
middle of tliis ccntuiy, they all entered 
into communion with the&lt; church of 
Geneva. The French Protestants were 
called Huguencts, [see Huguenots,] 
by their adversaries, by way of con- 
tempt. Their fate wa^ very severe, 
being persecuted with unparalleled fu- 
ry ; and though many princes of the 
blood, and of the first nobility, had em- 
braoed their sentiments, yet in no part 
of the world did the reformers suffer so 
much. At last, all commotions were 
quelled by the fortitude and magnani- 
mity of Henry IV. who, in the year 
1598, granted all his subjects full liberty 
of conscience by the famous edict of 
Nantes, and seemed to have thoroughly 
established the reformation throughout 
his dominions. During the minority of 
Louis XIV. however, this edict was re- 
voked by cardinal Mazarine, since 
whicli time the Protestants have often 
been cruelly persecuted : nor was the 



nrofession of the reformed religion in 
France at any time so safe as in most 
other countries of Europe. 

In the other parts of Europe the op- 
position to the churcli of Rome was but 
Faint and ambiguous before the diet of 
Augsburg. Before that period, how- 
ever, it appears, from undoubted testi- 
nir)ny, that the doctine of Luther had 
made a considerable, though probably 
secret progress through Spain, Hun- 
gary, Bohemia, Britain, Poland, and the 
Netherlands; and had in all these coun- 
tries many friends, of whom several re- 
paired to Wittemberg, in order to en- 
large their knowledge by means of 
Luther's conversation. Some of these 
countries threw off the Romish yoke 
entirely, and in others a prodigious 
number of families embraced the prin- 
ciples of the reformed religion. It is 
certain, indeed, and the Roman Catho- 
lics themselves acknowledge it without 
hesitation, that the papal doctrines and 
authority would have fallen into ruin in 
all parts of the world at once, had not 
the force of the secular arm been em- 

filoyed to support the tottering edifice, 
n the Netherlands, particulai'ly, the 
most grievious persecutions took place, 
so that by the emperor Charles V . up- 
wai'ds of 100,000 were destroyed, while 
still greater cruelties were exercised 
upon the people by his son Philip II. 
'1 he revolt of th6 United Provinces how- 
e^'er, and motives of real policy, at last 
put a stop to these furious proceedings ; 
and though in many provinces of the 
Netherlands, the establishment of the 
Popish religion was still continued, the 
Protestants have been long free from 
the danger of persecution on account of 
their principles. 

The reformation made a considerable- 
]jrogress in S/iahi and Itulij soon after 
the rupture between Luther and the 
Roman pontiff. In all the provinces of 
Italy, but more especially in the terri- 
tories of Venice, Tuscany, and Naples, 
the superstition of Rome lost ground, 
and great numbers of people of all 
ranks expressed an aversion to the pa- 
pal yoke. This occasioned violent and 
dangerous commotions in the kingdom 
of Naples in the year 1546 ; which, 
however, were at last quelled by the 
united efforts of Charles V. and his 
viceroy Don Pedro di Toledo. In se- 
veral places the pope put a stop to the 
progress of the reformation by letting 
loose the inquisitors, who spread dread- 
ful marks of their barbarity through 
the greatest part of Italy. Those for- 
midable ministers of superstition put so 
many to death, and peipetrated such

horrid acts of cruelty and oppression, 
that most of the reformed consulted 
their safety by a voluntary exile, while 
others returned to the religion of Rome, 
at least in external appearance. But 
the inquisition, which frightened into 
the profession of popery several Pro- 
testants in other parts of Italy, could 
never make its way into the kingdom of 
Naples ; nor could either the authority 
or entreaties of the pope engage the 
Neapolitans to admit even visiting in- 
quisitoi's. 

In Spain, sevei^al people embraced 
the Protestant religion, not only fi'om 
the controversies of Luther, but even 
fi'om those divines whom Charles V. 
had brought with him into Germany in 
order to refute the doctrines of Luther; 
for these doctors imbibed ti\e pretended 
heresy, instead of refuting it, and pro- 
pagated it more or less on their return 
home. But the inquisition, which could 
obtain no footing in Naples, reigned tri- 
umphant in Spain ; and by the most 
dreadful methods fi-ightened the peo- 
ple back into popery, and suppressed 
the desire of exchanging their super- 
stition for a more rational plan of reli- 
gion. It was, indeed, presumed that 
Charles liimself died a Protestant ; and, 
it seems to be certain, that, when the 
approach of death had dissipated those 
schemes of ambition and grandeur which 
liad so long blinded him, his sentiments 
became much more rational and agree- 
able to Christianity than they had ever 
been. All the ecclesiastics who had at- 
tended him, as soon as he expired, were 
sent to the inquisition, and committed to 
the flames, or put to death by some 
other method equally terrible. Such 
was tbe fate of Augustine Casal, the em- 
peror's preacher ; of Constantine Pon- 
tius, his confessor ; of Egidius, whom he 
had named to the bishopric of Tortosa ; 
of Baitholomew de Caranza, a Domini- 
can, who had been confessor to king 
Philip and queen Mary ; with twenty 
others of less note. 

In England, the principles of the re- 
formation began to be adopted as soon 
as an account of Luther's doctrines 
could be conveyed thitlicr. In that 
kingdom there were still great remains 
of the sect called Lollards, whose doc- 
trine resembled that of Luther ; and 
among v^'hom, of consequence, the sen- 
timents of our reformer gained great 
credit. Henr}" VIII. king of England at 
that time, was a violent partisan of the 
church of Rome, and had a particular 
veneration for the writings of Thomas 
Aquinas. Being informed that Luther 
5poke of his favourite author with con- 



tempt, he conceived a violent prejudice 
against the reformer, and even wrote 
against him, as we have already ob- 
served. Luther did not hesitate at 
writing against his majesty, overcame 
him in argument, and ti-eated him with 
very little ceremony. The first step 
towards public reformation, however, 
was not taken till the year 1529. 
(ireat complaints had been made in 
England, and of a very ancient date, of 
the usurpations of the clergy ; and, by 
the prevalence of the Lutheran opi- 
nions, these complaints were now Be- 
come more general than befoi'e. The 
House of Commons, finding the occasion 
favourable, passed several bills, re- 
straining the imjjositions of the clergy ; 
but what threatened the ecclesiastical 
oi'der with the greatest danger, wei-e, 
the se\'ere reproaches thrown out al- 
most without opposition in the House 
against the dissolute lives, ambition, and 
avarice of the priests, and their con- 
tinual encroachments on the privileges 
of the laity. The bills for regulating 
the clei'gy met with opposition in the 
House of Lords ; and bishop Fisher im- 
puted them to want of faith m the Com- 
mons, and to a formed design, proceed- 
ing from heretical and Lutheran prin- 
ciples, of robbing the chui-ch of her pa- 
trimony, and overturning the national 
religion. The Commons, however, 
complained to the king, by their speak- 
er, sir Tliomas Audley, of these re- 
flections thrown out against them ; and 
the bishop was obliged to retract his 
words. 

Though Henry had not the least idea 
of rejecting any, even of the most ab- 
surd Romisli superstitions, yet, as the 
oppressions of the clergy suited very 
ill with the violence of his own temper, 
he was pleased with every oppoi-tunity 
of lessening their power. In the par- 
liament of 1.531 he showed his design of 
humbling the clergy in the most ef- 
fectual manner. An obsolete statute 
was revived, from which it was pre- 
tended that it was criminal to submit to 
the legatine j^owcr which had been ex- 
ercised by cardinal Wolsey. By this 
stroke the whoU- body of the clergy was 
declared guilty at oiice^ They were too 
well acquainted with Henr\ 's disposi- 
tion, however, to re))lv, that their ruin 
would have been the certain conse- 
quence of their not submittiniy to Wol- 
sey's commission, which had been given 
by royal authority. Instead of making 
any defence of this kind, they chose to 
throw themselves upon tlie mercy of 
their sovereign ; which, however, it cost 
them 118,840/. to procure. A confession

was likewise extorted from them, that 
the king was protector and supreme 
head of the church of England ; though 
some of them had the dexterity to get a 
clause inserted which invalidated the 
whole submission, viz. in so far as is 
permitted by the law of C/irikt. 

The king, having thus begun to re- 
duce the power of the clergy, kept no 
bounds with them afterwards. He did 
not, indeed, attempt any reformation in 
religious matters ; nay, he persecuted 
most violently such as did attempt this 
in the least. Indeed, the most essential 
article of his creed seems to have been 
his own supremacy ; for whoever de- 
nied this was sure to suffer the most se- 
vere penalties, whether Protestant or 
Papist. 

He died in 1547, and was succeeded 
by his only son Edwai'd VI. Thisamia- 
bleprince, whose early youth was crown- 
ed with that wisdom, sagacity, and vir- 
tue, that would have done honour to 
advanced years, gave new spirit and 
vigour to the Protestant cause, and was 
its brightest ornament, as well as its 
most effectual support. He encouraged 
learned and pious men of foreign coun- 
tries to settle in England, and addressed 
a particular invitation to Martin Bucer 
and Paul Fagius, whose moderation 
added a lustre to their other virtues, 
that by the ministry and labours of these 
eminent men, in concert with those of 
the friends of the reformation in Eng- 
land, he might purge his dominions from 
the sordid fictions of popery, and esta- 
blish the pure doctrines of Christianity 
in their place. For this purpose he is- 
sued out the wisest orders for the re- 
storation of true religion ; but his reign 
■was too short to accomplish fully such a 
glorious purpose. In the year 1553 he 
was taken from his loving and afflicted 
subjects, whose sorrow was inexpressi- 
ble, and suited to their loss. His sister 
Mary, (the daughter of Catharine of 
Arragon, from whom Henry had been 
separated by the famous divorce,) a fu- 
rious bigot to the church of Rome, and a 
princess whose natural character, like 
the spirit of her religion, was despotic 
and cruel, succeeded him on the British 
thi'one, and imposed anew the arbitrary 
Jaws and the tyrannical yoke of Rome 
upon the people of England. Nor were 
the methods which she employed in the 
cause of superstition better than the 
cause itself, or tempered by any senti- 
ments of equity or compassion. Barba- 
rous tortures, and death in the most 
shocking forms, awaited those who op- 
posed her will, or made the least stand 
against the restoration of popery j and. 



among many other victims, the learned 
and pious Cranmer, archbishop of Can- 
terbury, who had been one of the most 
illustrious instruments of the reforma- 
tion in England, fell a sacrifice to her 
fury. This odious scene of persecu- 
tion was happilv concluded in the year 
1558 by the death of the queen, who left 
no issue ; and, as soon as her successor 
the lady Elizabeth ascended the throne, 
all things assumed a new and pleasing 
aspect. This illustrious princess, whose 
sentiments, counsels, and projects, 
breathed a spirit superior to the natural 
softness and delicacy of her sex, exerted 
this vigorous and manly spirit in the de- 
fence of oppressed conscience and ex- 
piring lil)erty, broke anew the despotic 
voke of papal authority and supersti- 
tion ; and, delivering her people from 
the bondage of Rome, established that 
form of religious doctrine and ecclesias- 
tical government which still subsists in 
England. This i"eligious establishment 
differs in some respects from the plan 
that had been formed by those whom 
Edward VI. had employed for promoting 
the cause of the reformation, and ap- 
proaches nearer to the rites and disci- 
pline of former times; though it is wide- 
ly different, and in the most important 
points, entirely opposite to the princi- 
ples of the Roman hierarchy. 

The cause of the reformation under- 
went in Ireland the same vicissitudes 
and I'evolutions that had attended it in 
England. When Henry VIII. after the 
abolition of the papal authority, was de- 
clared supreme head upon earth of the 
church of England, (ieorge Brown, a 
native of England, and a monk of the 
Augustine order, whom that monarch 
had created, in the year 1535, archbi- 
shop of Dublin, began to act with the 
utmost vigour in consequence of this 
change in the hierarchy. He ptirged 
the churches of his diocese from super- 
stition in all its various forms, pulled 
down images, destroyed relics, abolish- 
ed absurd and idolatrous rites ; and, by 
the influence as well as authority he had 
in Ireland, caused the king's supremacy 
to be acknoAvledged in that nation. 
Henry showed, soon after, that this su- 
premacy was not a vain title ; for he 
banished the monks out of that king- 
dom, confiscated their revenues, and de- 
stroyed their convents. In the reign of 
Edward VI. still further progress was 
made in the removal of popish supersti- 
tions by the zealous labours of bishop 
Brown, and the auspicious encourage- 
ment he granted to all who exerted 
themselves in the cause of the reforma- 
tion. But the death of this excellent

prince, and the accession of queen 
Mary, had like to have changed the 
face of affairs in Ireland as much as in 
England; but her designs were disap- 
poiiited by a very curious adventure, of 
which the following account has been 
copied from the papers of Richard earl 
of Cork : — " Queen Mary having dealt 
severely with the Protestants in England, 
about the latter end of her reign, signed 
a commission for to take the same course 
with them in Ireland ; and, to execute 
the same with greater force, she nomi- 
nates Dr. Cole one of the commission- 
ers. This doctor coming with the com- 
mission to Chester on his journey, the 
mayor of thart city, hearing that her ma- 
jesty was sending a messenger into Ire- 
land, and he being a churchman, waited 
on the doctor, who in discourse with the 
mayor taketh out of a cloke-bag a lea- 
ther box, saying unto him, Here is a 
connttinsioii that shall lash the heretics 
of Ireland, calling the Protestants by 
that title. The good woman of the 
house being well affected to the Pro- 
testant religion, and also having a bro- 
ther, named Johyi Edm unds, of the same, 
then a citizen in Dublin, was much 
troubled at the doctor's words ; but, 
watching her convenient time while the 
mayor took his leave, and the doctor 
complimented him down the stairs, she 
opens the box, takes the commission 
out, and places in lieu thereof a sheet of 
paper with a pack of cards wrapt up 
therein, the knave of clubs being faced 
uppermost. The doctor coming up to 
his chamber, suspecting nothing of what 
had been done, put up the box as for- 
merly. The next day, going to the 
watei'-side, wind and weather serving 
him, he sails towards Ireland, and land- 
ed on the 7th of October, 1558, at Dub- 
lin. Then coming to the castle, the 
lord Fitz Walter, being lord-deputy, 
sent for him to come before him and the 
privy council ; who coming in, after he 
had made a speech relating upon what 
account he came over, he presents the 
box unto the lord-deputy ; who causing 
it to be opened, that the secretary 
might read the commission, there was 
nothing save a pack of cards with the 
knave of clubs uppermost ; which not 
only startled the lord-deputy and coun- 
cil, but the doctor, who assured them he 
had a commission, but knew not how it 
was gone. Then the lord-deputy made 
answer, Let us have another commis- 
sion, and we will shuffle the cards in the 
mean while. The doctor being trou- 
bled in his mind, went away, and re- 
turned into England, and coming to the 
court, obtained another commission; 



but, staying for a wind on the water- 
side, news came to him that the queen 
was dead : and thus God preserved the 
Protestants of Ireland." — Queen Eliza- 
beth was so delighted with this story, 
which was related to her by lord Fitz- 
\\'alter on his return to England, that 
she sent for Elizabetli Edmunds, whose 
husband's name was Alattershad, and 
ga\e her a pension of 40/. during her 
life. 

In Scotland the seeds of reformation 
were very early sown by several noble- 
men who had resided in Germany dur 
ing the religious disputes there ; but for 
many years it was suppressed by the 
power of the pope, seconded by inhu- 
man laws and barbarous executions. 
The most eminent opposer of the papal 
jurisdiction was John Knox, a disciple of 
Calvin, a man of great zeal and invinci- 
ble fortitude. On all occasions he raised 
the drooping spirits of the reformers, 
and encouraged them to goon with their 
work, notwithstanding the opposition 
and treachery of the queen-regent ; till 
at last, in 1561, by the assistance of an 
English army sent by Eliza.beth, popery 
was, in a manner, totally extirpated 
throughout the kingdom. From this pe- 
riod the form of doctrine, worship, and 
discipline, established by Calvin at 
Geneva, has had the ascendancy in 
Scotland.

REFUGEES, a term first applied to 
the French Protestants, who, by the re- 
vocation of the edict of Nantes, were 
consti-ained to fly from persecution, and 
take refuge in foreign countries. Since 
that time, however, it has been extend-

REGIUM DONUM MONEY, mo- 
ney allowed by government to the Dis- 
senters. The origin of it was in the 
year 1723. As the Dissenters approved 
tliemselves strong friends to the house 
of Brunswick, they enjoyed favour ; and, 
being excluded all lucrative preferment 
in tiie church, the prime minister wish- 
ed to reward them for their loyalty, and, 
by a retaining fee, preserve tlieni "stead- 
fast. A considerable sum, thercfoi-e, 
was annually lodged with tlie heads of 
the Presbyterians, Independents, and 
Ba])tists, to be distributed among the 
necessitous ministers of their congrega- 
tions. 

REGENERATION, a new birth; 
that M ork of the Holy Spirit bv which 
•we experience a change of heart. It is 
to be distinguished from baptism whicli 
is an external rite, though some have 
confounded them togetlier. Nor does it 
signify a mere reformation of the out- 
ward conduct. Nor is it a conversion 
from one sect or creed to another ; or 
even from atheism. Nor are new fa- 
culties given in this change. Nor does 
it consist in new revelations, succession 
of terrors or consolations ; or any whis- 
per as it were from God to the heart, 
concerning his secret love, choice, or 
pur]50se to save us. It is expressed in 
Scripture by being bom again, John, 
iii. 7. born from above, so it may be ren- 
dered, John, iii. 2, 7, 27. being quicken- 
ed, Ephes. ii. 1. Christ formed in the 
heart, Gal. iv. 12. a partaking of the 
Divine nature, 2 Pet. i. 4. Thi efficient 
cause of regeneration is the Divine Spi- 
rit. That man is not the author of it is 
evident, if we consider, 1. The case in 
■which men are before it takes place ; a 
state of ignorance and inability, John, 
iii. 4. — 2. 'Phe nature of the work shows 
plainly that it is not in the power of 
men to do it : it is called a creation, a 



production of anew principle which was 
not before, and which man could not 
himself produce, Eph. ii. 8, 10. — 3. It is 
expressly denied to be of men, but de- 
clared to be of God, John, i. 12, 13. 
1 John, iii. 9. The instrumental cause, 
if it may be so called, is the word of 
God, Jam. i. 18. 1 Cor. iv. 15. The 
evidences of it are, con\iction of sin, 
holy sorrow, deep humility, knowledge, 
faith, repentance, love, and de\'Otedness 
to (iod's glory. The firojxerties of it 
are these : 1. It is a fiassive work, and 
herein it differs fi'om conversion. In 
regeneration we are passive, and receive 
from God ; in conversion we are active, 
and turn to him. — 2. It is an irresistible, 
or rather an invincible, work of God's 
gi'ace, Eph. iii. 8. — 3. It is an instanta- 
neous act, for there can be no medium 
between life and death ; and here it 
differs from sanctification, which is pro- 
gressive. — 4. It is a comfilete act, and 
perfect in its kind ; a change of the 
whole man, 2 Cor. v. 17. — 5. It is a

RELICS, in the Roman church, the 
remains of the bodies or clothes of saints 
or martyrs, and the instniments by 
which they were put to death, devoutly 
preserved, in honour to their memory ; 
kissed, revered, and carried in proces- 
sion. 

The respect which was justly due to 
the martyrs and teachers of the Chris- 
tian faith, in a few ages, increased al- 
most to adoration ; and at length adora- 
tion was really paid both to departed 
saints, and to relics of holy men, or holy 
things. The abuses of the church of 
Rome with respect to relics, are very 
flagrant and notorious ; for such was 
the rage for them at one time, that, as 
F. Mabillon, a Benedictine, justly com- 
plains, the altars were loaded with sus- 
pected relics ; numerous spurious ones 
being eveiy where offered to the piety 
and devotion of the faithful. He adds, 
too, that bones are often consecrated, 
which, so far from belonging to saints.

frobably do not belong to Christians, 
rom the catacombs numerous relics 
have been taken, and yet it is not known 
■vvho were the persons interred therein. 
In the eleventh century, relics were 
tried by fire, and those which did not 
consume were reckoned genuine, and 
the rest not. Relics were, and still are, 
preserved. on the altars whereon mass 
IS celebrated ; a square hole being made 
hi'the middle of the altar big enough to 
receive the hand ; and herein is the re- 
lic deposited, being first wrapped in red 
silk, and enclosed in a leaden box. 

The Romanists plead antiquity in be- 
half of relics ; for the Manichees, out of 
hatred to the flesh, which they consi- | 
dered as an evil principle, refused to 
honour the relics of saints ; which is 
reckoned a kind of proof that the Ca- 
tholics did it in the first ages. 

Wc know, indeed, that the touching 
of linen clothes, or relics, from an opi- 
nion of some extraordinary virtue de- 
rived therefrom, was as ancient as the 
first c.ges, there being a hole made in ' 
the coffins of the forty martyrs at Con- 
stantinople expressly for that purpose. 
The honouriTig the relics of saints, on 
which the church of Rome afterwards 
founded her superstitious and lucrative 
use of them, as objects of devotion, as 
a kind of charms, or amulets, and as 
instruments of pretended miracles, ap- 
pears to have originated in a very an- 
cient custom that prevailed among 
Christians, of assembling at the ceme- 
teries or burying places of the martyrs, 
for the purpose of commemorating 
them, and of performing di\'ine wor- 
ship. When the profession of Christi- 
anity obtained the protection of civil go- 
vernment, under Constantine the Great, 
stately churches were erected over se- 
pulchres, and their names and memo- 
ries were treated with every possible 
token of affection and respect. This re- 
verence, however, gradually exceeded 
all reasonable bounds ; and those pray- 
ers and religious serviced were thought 
to have a peculiar sanctity and virtue 
which were performed over their tombs: 
hence the practice which afterwards ob- 
tained of depositing relics of saints and 
martyi-s under the altars in all churches. 
This practice \vas then thought of such 
importance, that St. Ambrose would not 
consecrate a church because it had no 
relics ; and the council of Constanti- 
nople in TruUo ordained, that those al- 
tars should be demolished under which 
there were found no relics. The rage 
of procuring relics for this and other 
purposes of a similar nature became 
so excessive, that in 386, the emperor 



Theodosius the Great was obliged to 
pass a law, forbidding the people to dig 
up the bodies of the martyrs, and to 
ti'afhc in their relics. 

Such was the origin of that respect 
for sacred i-elics, which afterwards was 
pervei'ted into a formal worship of them, 
and became the occasion of innumerable 
processions, pilgrimages, and miracles, 
from which the church of Rome hath 
derived incrcdiljle advantage. In the 
end of the ninth century it was not suffi- 
cient to reverence departed saints, and 
to confide in their intercessions and guc- 
cours; to clothe them with an imaginary 
po%Yer of healing diseases, working mi- 
racles, and deli\ ering from all sorts of 
calamities and dangers ; their bones, 
their clothes, the ap]3arcl and furniture 
they had possessed during their lives, 
the very ground which they had touch- 
ed, or in which their putrefied carcasses 
were laid, were treated with a stupid 
veneration, and supposed to retain the 
marvellous virtue of healing all disor- 
ders, both of body and mind, and of de- 
fending such as possessed them against 
all tlie assaults and devices of the 
devil. The consequence of all this vi^as, 
that every one was eager to provide 
himself with these salutary remedies ; 
consequently great munbers undertook 
fatiguing and perilous voyages, and sub- 
jected themselves to all sorts of hard- 
ships ; while others made use of this de- 
lusion to accumulate their riches, and to 
impose ujkju the miserable multitude 
by the most impious and shocking in- 
ventions. As the demand for relics was 
prodigious and universal, the clergy em- 
ployed the utmost dexterity- to satisfy 
all demands, and were far from being 
nice in the methods they used for that 
end. The bodies of the saints were 
sought by fasting and prayer, instituted 
b)' the priest, in order to obtain a di- 
vine answer, and an infallible direction ; 
and this pretended direction never failed 
to accomplish their desires : the holy 
carcass was always found, and that al- 
ways in consequence, as they impiously 
gave out, of the suggestion and inspira- 
tion of God himself. Each discovery of 
this kind was attended with excessive 
demonstrations of joy, and animated the 
zeal of these devout seekers to enrich 
the church still more and more with 
this new kind of treasure. iVIany tra- 
velled with this view into the eastern 
provinces, and frequented the places 
which Christ and his disciples had ho- 
noured with their presence; that with 
the bones and other sacred remains of 
the first heralds of the Gospel, they 
miglit comfort dejected minds, calm

trembling consciences, save sinking 
states, and defend their inhabitants from 
all sorts of calamities. Nor did these 
pious travellers return home empty : 
the craft, dexterity, and knavery of the 
Greeks, found a rich prey in the stupid 
credulity of the Latin relic-hunters, 
and made a profitable commerce of this 
new devotion. The latter paid consi- 
derable sums for legs and arms, skulls, 
and jaw-bones (several of which were 
Pagan, and some not human,) and other 
things that were supposed to have be- 
longed to the primitive worthies of tlie 
Christian church ; and thus the Latin 
churches came to the possession of those 
celebrated relics of St. Mark, St. James, 
St, Bartholomew, Cyprian, Pantaleon, 
and others, which they show at this day 
with so much ostentation. But there 
were many, who, unable to procure for 
themselves these spiritual treasures by 
voyages and prayers, had recourse to 
violence and theft ; for all sorts of 
means, and all sorts of attempts, in a 
cause of this nature, were considered, 
when successful, as pious and accepta- 
ble to the Supreme Being. Besides the 
arguments from antiquity, to which the 
Papists refer in vindication of their wor- 
ship of relics, of which the reader may 
form some judgment from this article, 
Bellarmine appeals to Scripture in sup- 
port of it ; and cites the following pas- 
sages, viz. Exod. xiii. 19. Deut. xxxiv. 
6. 2 Kings, xiii. 21. 2 Kings, xxiii. 16, 
17, 18. Isaiah, xi. 10. Mat. xi. 20, 21, 
22. Acts, V. 12, 15. Acts, xix. 11, 12. 

The Roman Catholics in Great Bri- 
tain do not acknowledge any worship to 
be due to relics,- but merely a high ve- 
neration and respect, by which means 
they think they honour God, who, they 
say, has often wrought very extraordi- 
nary miracles by them. But, however 
proper this veneration and respect may 
be, its abuse has been so great and so 
general, as fully to warrant the rejec- 
tion of them altogether. 

Belies are forbidden to be used or 
brougiit into England by several sta- 
tutes ; and justices of peace are em- 
powered to search houses for po])ish 
books and relics, which, when found, 
are to be defaced, and burnt, &amp;:c. 3 Jac.

RELIEF, a species of Dissenters in 
Scotland, whose only difference from 
the Scotch established church is the 
choosing their own pastors. They were 
separated from the church in the year 
1752, occasioned by Mr. Thomas Gilles- 
pie being deposed for refusing to assist 
at the admission of a minister to a pa- 
rish who were unwilling to receive hun. 



WTien Mr. Gillespie was deprived o£ 
his parish, he removed to Dumferline, 
and preached there to a congregation 
who were attached to him, and vehe- 
mently opposed the law of patronage. 
Being excluded from the communion of 
the church, he, with two or three other 
ministers, constituted themselves into a 
presbytery, called the Presbytery of 
Relief; willing to afford relief to all 
" who adhered to the constitution of the 
church of Scotland, as exhibited in her 
creeds, canons, confessions, and forms 
of worship." They are unwilling it is 
said, to be reckoned seceders. Their 
licentiates are educated under the esta- 
blished church professors, whose certi- 
ficates they acknowledge. Many of their 
people receive the Lord's supper with 
equal readiness in the established 
church as in their own. The relief 
synod consists of about axty congrega- 
tions, and about 36,000 pei'sons. 

RELIGION is a Latin word, derived, 
according to Cicero, from rele^ere, 
" to re-consider ;" but according to 
Servius and most modern grammarians, 
from religare, " to bind fast." If the 
Ciceronian etymology be the true one, 
the word religion will denote the dili- 
gent study whatever pertains to the 
worship of God ; but, according to the 
other derivation, it denotes that obliga- 
tion which we feel on pur minds from 
tlie relation in which we stand to some 
superior power. The word is sometimes 
used as synonymous with sect ; but, in a 
practical sense, it is generally consider- 
ed as the same with godliness, or a life 
devoted to the worship and fear of God. 
Dr. Doddridge thus defines it : " Reli- 
gion consists in the resolution of the 
will for God, and in a constant care to 
avoid whatever we are persuaded he 
would disapprove, to despatch the work 
he has assigned us in lite, and to pro- 
mote his glory in the happiness of man- 
kind." See Godliness.] The foun- 
dation of all religion rests on the belief 
of the existence of God. As we have, 
however, already considered the evi- 
dences of the divine existence, thej 
need not be enumerated again in this 
place ; the reader will find them under 
the article Existence of God. 

Religion has been divided into natural 
and revealed. By natural religion is 
meant that knowledge, veneration, and 
love of God, and the practice of those 
duties to him, our fellow-creatures, and 
ourselves, which are discoverable by 
the right exercise of our rational facul- 
ties, from considering the nature and 
perfections of God, and our relation to 
him and to one another. By revealed

relipon is understood that discoverj'^ 
which he has made to us of his mind 
and will in the Holy Scriptures. As it 
respects natural religion, some doubt 
whether, properly speaking, there can 
be any such thing ; since, through the 
fall, reason is so depraved, that mun 
without revelation is under the greatest 
darkness and misery, as may be easily 
seen by considering the history of those 
nations who are destitute of ^t, and who 
are given up to barbarism, ignorance, 
cruelty, and evils of every kind. So far 
as this, however, may be observed, that 
the light of nature can give us no pi-o- 
per ideas of God, nor infoi-m us what 
worship will be- acceptable to him. It 
does not tell us how man became a fallen 
sinful creature, as he is, nor how he can 
be recovered. It affords us no intelli- 
gence as to the immortality of the soul, 
the resurrection of the body, and a fu- 
ture state of happiness and misery. The 
apostle, indeed, observes, that the Gen- 
tiles have the law written on their 
hearts, and are a law unto tliemselves ; 
yet the gi'eatest moralists among them 
were so blinded as to. be guilty of, and 
actually to countenance the greatest 
vices. Such a system, therefore, it is 
supposed, can hardly be said to be re- 
ligious which leaves man in such un- 
certainty, ignorance, and impiety. [See 
Revelation.] On the other side it is 
observed, " that, though it is in the 
highest degree probable that the pa- 
rents of mankind received all . their 
theological knowledge by supernatural 
means, it is yet obvious that some parts 
of that knowledge must have been capa- 
ble of a proof purely rational, otherwise 
not. a single religious truth could have 
been conveyed through the succeeding 
generations of the human race but by 
the immediate inspiration of each indi- 
vidual. We, indeed, admit many pro- 
positions as certainly true, upon the sole 
authority of the Jewish and Christian 
Scriptures, and we receive these Scrip- 
tures with gratitude as the lively ora- 
cles of God; but it is self-evident that 
we could n()t do either • the one or the 
other, were we not convinced by natural 
means that God exists; that he is a 
being of goodness, justice, and -power; 
and that he ins])ired with divine wisdom 
the penmen of these sacred volumes. 
Now, though it is very possible that no 
man, or body of men, left to themselves 
from infancy in a desert world, would 
ever have made a theological discovery, 
yet, whatever propositions relating to 
the being and attributes of the First 
Cause, and duty of man, can be demon- 
strated by humaij reason, independent 



of written revelation, may be called 7m- 
tural theology, and are of the utmost 
importance, as being to us the first pnn- 
ciples of all religion. Natural theology, 
in this sense of the word, is the founda- 
tion of the Christian revelation ; for, 
without a pi'evious knowledge of it, we 
could have no evidence that the Scrip- 
tures of the Old and New Testaments 
are indeed the word of God." 

The religions which exist in the world 
have been generally divided into four, 
the Pagan, the Jewish, the Mahome- 
tan, and the Christian ; to which arti- 
cles the reader is referred. The va- 
rious duties of the Christian religion 
also are stated in their different places. 
See also, as connected with this ai'ticle, 
the articles Inspiration, Revela- 
tion, and Theology, and books there

RELIGIOUS, in a general sense, 
something that relates to religion. It is 
also used for a person engaged by so- 
lemn vows to the monastic life ; or a 
person shut up in a monastery, to lead a 
life of devotion and austerity under some 
rule or institution. The male religious 
are called monks and friars; the fe- 
males, nuns and canon€f&gt;.-£s. 

RELLYANISTS,orjt^ELLYAN Uni- 
VERSALISTS, the foilowers of Mr 
James Relly. He first commenced his 
ministerial character in connection with 
Mr. Whitfield, and was received with 
great popularity. Upon a change of his 
views, he encountered reproacli, and 
was pronounced by many as an enemy 
to godliness. He believed that Christ 
as a Mediator was so united to man- 
kind, that his actions were theirs, his 
obedience and sufferings theirs ; and, 
consequently, that he has as fully re- 
stored the whole human race to the di- 
vine favour, as if all had obeyed and 
suffered in their own persons ; and upon 
this persuasion he preached a finished 
salvation, called by the apostle Jude, 
"The comnrion salvation." Many of his 
followers are removed to the world of 
spirits; but a branch still survives, and 
meets at the chapel in Windmill-street, 
Moorfields, London ; where there are 
different brethren who speak. They 
are not observers of ordinances, such as 
water-baptism and the sacrament ; pro- 
fessing to believe only in one baptism, 
which they call an immersion of the 
mind or conscience into truth by the 
teaching of the Spirit of God ; anr by 
the same Spirit they are enabled to teed 
on Christ as the bread of life, professing • 
that in and with Jesus they possess all • 
things. They inculcate and maintain, 
good woi'ks for necessary pui*poses;

()ut tOHtciirl Uiiit the principal and only 
works wliich ought tu be attended to, is 
the doing real good without religious os- 
tentation ; that to relieve the miseries 
and distresses of mankind arxording to 
our ability, is doing more real good than 
the superstitious observance of religious 
ceremonies. In general they appear to 
believe that there will be a resurrection 
to life, and a resurrection to condemna- 
tion ; that believers only will be among 
the former, who as first fruits, and 
kings and priests, will have part in the 
first resurrection, and shall reign with 
Christ in his kingdom of the millennium; 
that unbelievers who are after raised, 
must wait the manifestation of the Sa- 
viour of the world, under that con- 
demnation of conscience which a mind 
in darkness and wrath must necessarily 
feel ; that believers, called kings and 
priests, will be made the medium of 
communication to their condemned bre- 
thren ; and like Joseph to his brethren, 
though he spoke roughly to them, in 
reality overflowed with affection and 
tenderness ; that ultimately every knee 
shall bow, and every tongue confess 
that in the Lord they have righteous- 
ness and strerf^"*h ; and thus every ene- 
my shall be s\yjidued to the kingdom 
and glory of the Great Mediator. A 
Mr. Muri'ay belonging to this society 
emigrated to America, and preached 
these sentiments at Boston and else- 
where. Mr. Rclly published several 
works, the principal of which were, 
"Union." "The Trial of Spirits." 
" Christian Liberty." '• One Baptism." 
"The Salt of Sacrifice." "vVntichrist 
resisted." " Letters on Univci'sal Sal- 
vation." "Tire Cherubimical Mys- 
tery."

REMONSTRANTS, a title given to 
the Arminians, by I'eason of the remon- 
strance which, in 1610, they made to the 
states of Holland against the sentence 
of the Synod of Dort, which condemned 
them as heretics. Episcopius and Gro- 
tius were at the head of the Remon- 
strants, whose principles were first open- 
\y patronised in England 'oy archbishopT 
Laud. In Holland,' the Calvinists pre-' 
sented an address in opposition to the 
remonstrance of the Arminians, and 
called it a counter-remonstrance. See 
Arminians and Dort. 

REMORSE, uneasiness occasioned, 
by a consciousness of guilt. When it is 
blended with the fear of punishment, 
and I'ises to despair, it constitutes the 
•supreme wretchedness of the mind. 

REPENTANCE, in general, is sor- 



row for any thing past. In theology it 
signifies that sorrow for sin which pro- 
duces newness of life. The Greek word 
most frequently used in the New Tes- 
tament for repentance is (iSTavoia, which 
properly denotes an afterthought, or the 
soul recollecting its own actings ; and 
that in such a manner as to produce sor- 
row in the review, and a desire of amend- 
ment. Another word also is used 
{ntTa\ii\o]iai,) which signifies anxiety or 
uneasiness upon the consideration of 
what is done. There are, however, va- 
rious kinds of repentance ; as, 1. A na- 
tural repentance, or what is merely the 
effect of natural conscience. — 2. A na- 
tio7ial repentance, such as the Jews in 
Babylon were called unto ; to which 
temporal blessings were promised, Ezek. 
xviii. 30. — 3. An external repentance, 
or an outward humiliation for sin, as in 
the case of Ahab.— 4. A hypocritical re- 
pentance, as represented in Ephraim, 
Hos. vii. 16. — 5. A legal repentance, 
which is a mere work of the law, and 
the effect of convictions of sin by it, 
which in time wear off, and come to 
nothing. — 6. An evavgclical repentance, 
which consists in conviction of sin ; sor- 
row for it ; confession of it ; hatred to 
it ; and renunciation of it. A legal and 
evangelical repentance are distinguish- 
ed thus : 1. A legal repentance flows 
only from a sense of danger and fear 
of wrath; but an .evangelical repent- 
ance is a true mourning for sin, and an 
earnest desire of deliverance from it. — 

2. A legal repentance flows from un- 
belief, but evangelical is always the fruit 
and consequence of a saving faith. — 

3. A legal repentance flows from an 
aversion to God and to his holy law, 
but an evangelical from love to both. — 

4. A legal repentance ordinarily flows 
from discoui-agement and despondency, 
but evangelical from encouraging hope. 
— 5. A legal repentance is temporary, 
but evangelical is the daily exercise of 
the true Christian. — 6. A legal re- 
pentance does at most produce only a 
partial and external reformation, but an 
evangelical is a total change of heart 
and life. 

T'^e author of true repentance is 
God, Acts v. 31. The subjects of it 
are sinners, since none but those who 
have sinned ca?i repent. The means of 
repentance is the word, and the minis- 
ters of it ; yet sometimes considei'ation, 
sanctified afflictions, conversation, &amp;c. 
have been the instruments of repentance. 
The blessings connected with repent- 
ance are, pardon, peace, and everlast- 
ing life. Acts xi. 18. The time oi re- 
pentance is the present life, Isaiali, Iv.

cesnitij of repentance appears evident 
from the evil of sin ; the misery it in- 
volves us in here ; the commands given 
us to repent in God's word ; the pro- 
mises made to the penitent j and the ab- 
solute incapability of enjoying God here 
or hereafter without it. See JDickin-

REPROACH, the act of finding fault 
in opprobrious terms, or attempting to 
expose to infamy and disgrace. In 
whatever ca\ise we engage, however 
disinterested our motives, however lau- 
dable our designs, reproach is what we 
must expect. But it oecomes us not to 
retaliate, but to bear it patiently ; and 
so to live, that every charge brought 
against us be groundless. If we be re- 

E reached for righteousness' sake, we 
ave no reason to be ashamed nor to be 
afraid. AH' good, men have thus suffer- 
ed, Jesus Christ himself especially. We 
have the greatest promises of support. 
Besides, it has a tendency to humble us, 
detach us from the world, and excite 
in us a desire for that state of blessedness 
where all reproach shall be done away. 
REPROBATION, the act of aban- 
doning, or state of being abandoned, to 
eternal destniction, and is applied to 
that decree or resolve which God has 
■ taken from all eternity to punish sin- 
ners who shall die in impenitence ; in 
which sense it is opposed to election. 
See Election and Predestination. 
REPROOF, blame or reprehension 
spoken to a person's face. It is dis- 
tmguished ft'om a refirimand thus. He 
who refiroves another, points out his 
fault, and blames him. He who rep-ri- 
mands^ affects to punish, and mortifies 
the offended. In giving rc/iroof, the 
follov.'ing ru^es may be obscr\'ed : 1. We 
should not be forward In reproving our 
elders or superiors,' but rather to re- 
monstrate and supplicate for redress. 
What the ministers of God do in this 
kind, they do by special commission, as 
those that must give an account, 1 Tim. 
v. 1. Heb. xiii. 17. — 2. We must not re- 

Erove rashly ; there should be proAf 
efore reproof. — 3. We should not re- 
pro%'e fur slight matters, for such faults 
or defects as proceed from natural 



frailty, from inadvertency, or mistake 
in matters of small consequence. — 4. 
W^e should never reprove unseasonably, 
as to the time, the place, or the circum- 
stances.— 5. We should reprove mildly 
and .sweetly, in the calmest manner, in 
the gentlest terms. — 6. We should not 
affect to be reprehensive : perhaps 
there is no one considered more trou- 
blesome than he who delig:hts in finding 
fault with others. In receiving re/iroof 
it may be observed, 1. That we should 
not reject it merely because it may 
come froni those who are not exactly 
on a level with ourselves. — 2. We 
should consider whether the reproof 
given be not actually deserved ; and 
that, if the reprover knew all, whether 
the reproof would not be sharper than 
what it is. — 3. Whether, if taken huqibly 
and patiently, it will not be of great ad- 
vantage to us. — 4. That it is nothing 
l)ut pride to suppose that we are never 
to be the suiijects of reproof, since it Is 
human to err. 

RESENTMENT, generally used in 
an ill sense, implying a determination 
to return an injury. Dr. Johnson ob- 
serves, that resentment is an union of 
sorrow with malignity ; a combination 
of a- passion which all endeavour to 
avoid, with a passion which all concur 
to detest. The man who retires to me- 
ditate mischief, and to exasperate his 
own rage, whose thoughts are employ- 
ed only on means of distress and con- 
trivances of ruin, whose mind never 
pauses from the remembrance of his 
own sufferings, but to indu'cge some hope 
of enjoying the calamities of another, 
may justly be numbered among the most 
miserable of human beings ; among 
those who are guijty ; who have neither 
the gladness of prospeiity, nor thg calm 
of innocence. 

RESIGNATION, a submission with- 
out discontent to the will of God. The 
obligations to this duty arise from, 1. 
The perfections of God, Deut. xxxii. 4. 
— 2. The purposes of God, Eph. i. 11. 
— 3. The commands of Ciod, Heb. xii. 
9. — 4". The promises of God, 1 Pet. v, 
7. — 5. Our own interest, Hos'. ii. 14, 
15. — 6; Tlie prospect of eternal felicity, 
Heb. iv. 9. See articles Affliction, 
Despair, and Patiekce; Jpyn/i/ng- 
ton on Resignation ; Brock's Mute 
Christian; Gi-osvenor's Mourner ; and 
the books under Affliction. 

RESTITUTION, that act of justice 
by whicli we restore to our neiglibour 
whatever we ha^.e unjiistly deprived 
him of, Exod. xxii. 1. Luke, xix. 8. 

Moralists observe respecting restitu- 
tion, 1. That where it can be made in

kind, or the injury can be certainly va- 
lued, we are to i-estore the thing or the 
'value. — 2. We are bound to restore the 
thing with the natural increase of it, 
that is, to satisfy for the loss sustained 
in the mean time, and the gain hinder- 
ed. — 3. Where the thing cannot be re- 
stored, and the value of it is not certain, 
we are to give .reasonable satisfaction, 
according to' a middle estimation. — 4. 
We are at least to give by way of res- 
titution what the law would give, for 
that is generally equal, and in most 
cases rather favourable than rigorous. 
■—5. A man is not only bound to restitu- 
tion for the injury he did, but for all 
that directly follows upon the injurious 
act. For the first injury being wilful, 
we are sujifiosed to will all that which 
folWws upon it. Tillotsoii's Sermons,

RESURRECTION, a rising again 
from the state • of the dead ; generally 
applied to the resui'rection of the last 
day. This doctrine is argued, 1. From 
the resurj-ection of Christ, 1 Cor. xv. — 
2. From the doctrines of grace, as union, 
election, redemption, &amp;g. — 3. From 
Scripture testimonies. Matt, xxii, 23, 
&amp;c.. Job, xix. 25, 27. Isaiah, xxvi. 19. 
Phil. ii. 20. 1 Cor. xv. Dan. xii. 2. 3 
Thess. iv. 14. Rev. xx. 13. — 4. From 
the general judgment, which of coui'se 
requires it. As to the nature of this re- 
surrection, it will be, 1. General, Rev. 
XX. 12, 15. 2 Cor. v. 10.— 2. Of the 
saine body. It is true, indeed, that the 
body has not always the same particles, 
which are continually changing, but it 
has always the same constituent parts, 
which proves its identity ; it is the I 
hame body that is born that dies, and 
The satne that dies that shall rise a.gain ; 
bO that Mr. Locke's objection to the idea 
of the same body is a mere quibble.— 3. 
The resurrection will be at the com- 
?nand of Christ, and by his power, John 
v. 28, 29. — 4-. Perhaps as to the manner 
it will be succe.s-sh'e ; the dead in Christ 
rising first, 1 Cor. xv. 23. 1 Thess. iv. 
16. This doctrine is of great use and 
imjmrtance. It is one of the first prin- 
ciples of the doctrine of Christ ; the 
^vhole Gospel stands or falls with it. It 
serves to enlarge our views of the di- 
T'inc perfections. It encourages our 
faith and trust in God under a,ll the dif- 
ficulties of life. It has a tendency to 
regulate all our aflFections and moderate 
our desires after earthly things. It sup- 
ports the saints under the loss of near 
lelations, and enables them to rejoice 
in the glorious prospect set before them.

RESURRECTION OF CHRIST. 
Few articles ai-e more important than 
this. It deserves our particular atten- 
tion, because it is the -grand hinge on 
which Christianity turns. Hence, says 
the apostle, he was delivered for our of- 
fences, and raised again for our jnstiji- 
cation. Infidels, however, have disbe- 
lieved it, but with what little reason we 
may easily see on considering the sub- 
ject. "If the body of Jesus Christ," 
says Saurin, " were not raised from the 
dead, it must have been stolen away. 
But this theft is incredible. Wlio com- 
mitted it ? The enemies of Jesus Christ? 
W^ould they have contributed to his 
glory by countenancing a report of his 
resuri'ectiou ? Would his disciples ? It 
is probable they would not, and it is 
next to certain they could not. How 
could they have undertaken to remove 
the body :• Frail and timorous creatures, 
people who fled as soon as they saw 
him taken into custody ; even Peter, 
tlie most courageous, trembled at the 
voice of a servant girl, and three times 
denied that he knew him. People of 
this character, would they have dai'ed 
to resist the authority of the governor ? 
Would they have undertaken to oppose 
the determination of the Sanhedrim, to 
force a guard, and to elude, or over- 
come, soldiers armed and aware of dan- 
ger ? If Jesus Christ were not risen 
again (I speak the language of unbe- 
lievers,) he had deceived his disciples 
with vain hopes of his resurrection. 
How came the disciples not to discover 
the imposture P Would they have ha- 
zarded themselves by undertaking an 
enterprise so perilous in favour of a man 
who had so ci'uelly imposed on their 
credulity ? But were we to grant that 
they formed trie design of removing the 
body, how could they have executed it ? 
How could soldiers armed, and on guard, 
suffer themselves to be over-reached, 
by a few timorous people? Either, says 
St. Augustine, th&amp;y were asleep, or 
awake: if they were awake, why shovld 
they suffer the body to be taken away ? 
If asleep., hoiv could they know that the 
disciples took it away ? How dare they 
then, depose that it was stolen. 

. The testimony of the apostles furaish- 
es us with arguments, and there are 
eight considerations which give the evi- 
dence sufficient weight. 1. The nature 
of these witnesses. They were not men 



RES

RET 



of power, I'iches, eloquence, credit, to 
impose upon the world ; they were 
poor and mean. — 2. The number of 
these witnesses. See 1 Cor. xv. Luke, 
xxiv. 34. Mark, xvi. 14. Matt, xxviii. 
10. It is not likely that a collusion 
should have been held among so many 
to support a lie, which would be of no 
utility to them. — 3. The facts them- 
selves which they avow ; not supposi- 
tions, distant events, or events related 
by others, but real facts which they 
saw with their own eyes, 1 John, i. — 4. 
The agreement of their evidence : -they 
all deposed the same thing. — 5. Observe 
the tribunals before which they gave 
evidence : Jews and heathens, philoso- 
phers and rabbins, courtiers and law- 
yers. If they had been impostors, the 
fraud certainly would have been dis- 
covered. — 6. The place in which they 
bore their testimony. Not at a distance, 
where they might not easily have been 
detected, if false, but at Jerusalem, in 
the synagogues, in the pretorium. — 7. 
The time of this testimony : not years 
after, but three da3's after, they de- 
clai'ed he was risen ; yea, before their 
rage was quelled, while Calvary was 
yet dyed with the blood tliey had spilt. 
If it had been a fraud, it is not likely 
they would have come forward in such 
broad day-light, amidst so much oppo- 
sition. — 8. Lastly, the motives which 
induced them to publish the resur- 
rection : not to gain fame, riches, glory, 
profit ; no, they exposed themselves to 
suffering and death, and proclaimed the 
truth from conviction of its importance 
and certaintv. 

" Collect,'" says Saurin, " all these 
proofs together; consider them in one 
point of view, and see how many extra- 
vagant suppositions must be advanced, 
if the resurrection of our Saviour be de- 
nied. It must be supposed that guards, 
who had been particularly cautioned by 
their officers, sat down to sleep ; and 
that, however, they deserved credit 
when they said the body of Jesus Christ 
was stolen. It must be supposed that 
men, who have been imposed on in the 
most odious and cruel manner in the 
v/orld, hazarded their dearest enjoy- 
ments for the glory of an impostor. It 
must be supposed that ignorant and illi- 
terate men, who had neither reputa- 
tion, fortune, nor eloquence, possessed 
the art of fascinating the eves of all the 
chm'ch. It must be supposed either 
that five hundred persons were all de- 
prived of their senses at a time, or that 
they were all deceived in the plainest 
matters of fact ; or that this multitude 
of false witnesses had found out the se- 



cret of never contradicting themselves 
or one another, and of being always uni- 
form in their testimony. It must be 
supposed that the most expert courts of 
judicature could not find out a shadow 
of contradiction in a palpable imposture. 
It must be supposed that the apostles, 
sensible men in other cases, chose pre- 
cisely those places and those times 
which were most unfavourable to their 
views. It must be supposed that mil- 
lions madly suffered imprisonments, tor- 
tui'es, and crucifixions, to spread an il- 
lusion. It must be supposed that ten 
thousand miracles were wrought in fa- 
vour of falsehood, or all these facts 
must be denied ; and then it must be 
supposed that the apostles were idiots ; 
that the enemies of Christianity Avere 
idiots; and that all the primitive Chi-is- 
tians were idiots." 

The doctrine of the resurrection of 
Christ affords us a variety of useful in- 
structions. Here we see evidence of 
divine power ; prophecy accomplished , 
the character of Jesus established; his 
work finished ; and a future state proved. 
It is a ground of faith, the- basis of 
hope, a source of consolation, and a 
stimulus to obedience. See Sauriyi's

RETIREMENT, the stnte of a per- 
son who quits a public station in order 
to be alone. Retirement i.v of great ad- 
vantage to a wise man. To him "the 
hour of solitude is the hour of medita- 
tion. He communes with his own heart. 
He reviews the actions of his past life. 
He corrects what is amiss. He re- 
joices in what is right : and, Aviser by 
experience, la;.'s the plan of his future- 
life. The great and the noble, the Avisc 
and the learned, the pious and the 
good, have been lovers of serious re- 
tirement. On this field the patriot 
forms his schemes, the philosopher pur- 
sues his discoveries, the saint improves 
himself in wisdom and goodness. Soli- 
tude is the hallowed ground which reli- 
gion in every age has adopted as its OAVii. 
There her sacred inspiration is felt, and 
her holy mystei-ies elevate the soul ; 
there deA^otibn lifts up the A^oice ; there 
falls the tear of conti-ition ; there the 
heart pours itself forth before him who 
made, and him Avho redeemed it. Apart 
from men, Ave live witli nature, and con- 
verse with God." Logan's Sermon»,\ol.

■ REVELATION, the act of reveal- 
ing or making a thing public that was 
before unknown ; it is also used for the 
discoveries made by God to his pro- 
phets, and by them to the world ; and 
more particularly for the books of the 
Old and New Testament. A revela- 
tion is, in the first place, /lossidle. . God 
may, for any thing we can certainly 
tell, think proper to make some dis- 
covery to his creatures which they knew 
not before. As he is a being of infinite 
power, we may be assured he cannot be 
at a loss for means to communicate his 
will, and that in such a manner as will 
sufficiently mark it his own. — 2. It is 
desirable.' .For, whatever the light of 
nature could do for mun before reason 
was depraved, it is evident that it has 
done little for man siuce. Though rea- 
son be necessary to examine the autho- 
rity of divine revelation, yet, in the 
present state, it is incapable of giving 
\is proper discoveries of God, the way 
of salvation, or of bringing ns into a 
state of communion with God. It»j 
tlierefore follows. — 3. That it is ?7eces- 
eciry. Without it we can attain to no 
certain knowledge of God, of Christ, of 
the Holy (ihost, of pardon, of justifica- 
tion, of sanctification, of happiness, of a 
future state of rewards and piniish- 
ments.— -4. No revelation, as Mr. Brown 
observes, relative to the redemption of 
mankind, could answer its respective 
ends, unless it were sufficiently marked 
Avith internal ajid external evidences. 
That the fiible hath internal evidence, 
is evident from the ideas it gives us of 
God's perfections, of the law of nature, 
of redemption, of the state of man, &amp;c. 
As to its external evidence, it is easily 
seen by the characters of the men who 
composed it, the miracles wrought, its 
success, the fulfilment of its predictions, 
&amp;c. [See Scripture.] 5. The contents 
of revelation are agreeable to reason. It 
is true there are some things al)ove the 
reach of reason ; but a revelation con- 
taining such things is no contradiction, 
as long as it is not against reason ; f(n' 
if every thing be rejected which cannot 
be exactly conriprchended, we must be- 
come unbelievers at once of almost 
every thing around us. The doctrines, 
the institutions, the threatenines, the 
precepts, the promises, of the Bible, arc 
every way reasonable. The matter, 
form, and exhibition of revelation are 
consonant with reason. — 6. The revela- 
tion contained in our Bible is perfectly 
credible. It is an address to the reason. 



judgment, and affections of men. The 
Old Testament abounds with the 
finest specimens of history, sublimity, 
and interesting scenes of Providence. 
The facts of the New Testament are 
supported by undoubted evidence from 
enemies and friends. The attestations 
to the early existence of Christianity 
! are numerous from Ignatius, Polycaip, 
Irenseus, Justin Martyr, and Tatian, who 
were Christians ; and by Tacitus, Sue- 
tori, Serenus, Pliny, &amp;c. who' Avere 
Heathens. [See Christianity.] — 7. 
The. revelations contained in our Bible 
are divinely inspired. The matter, the 
manner, the scope, the predictions, mi- 
racles, preservation, Sec. &amp;c. all prove 
this, [See Inspiration.] — 8. Revela- 
tidn is hitendcd for universal benefit. It 
is a common objection to it, that hither- 
to it has been confined to few, and 
\ therefore could not come from God who 
is so benevolent ; but this mode of ar- 
guing will equally hold good against the 
Permission of sin, the inequalities of 
rovidence, the dreadful evils and mi- 
series of mankind which God could 
have prevented. It must be farther ob- 
sened, that none deserve a revelation ; 
that men have despised and abused the 
early revelations he gave to his people. 
This revelation, we have reason to be- 
lieve, shall be made known to mankind. 
Already it is spreading its genuine in- 
fluence. In the cold regions of the 
north, in the burning regions of the 
south, the Bible begins to be known ; 
and, from the predictions it contains, 
we believe the glorious sun of revela- 
tion shall shine and illuminate the whole 
globe. — 9. l"he effects of revelation 
which have already taken place irx the 
world have been astonishing. In pro- 
portion as the Bible has been known, 
arts and sciences have been cultivated, 
peace and liberty have been diffused, 
civil and moral obligation have been at- 
tended to. Nations have emerged from 
ignorance and barbarity, whole com- 
munities have been morally reformed, ' 
unnatural practices abolished, and wise 
laws instituted. Its spiritual effects 
have been wonderful. Kings and pea- 
sants, conquerors and philosophers, the 
wise and the ignorant, the rich and the 
poor, have be^n brought to the foot of 
the cross ; yea, millions have been en- 
lightened, improved, reformed, and 
made happy by its influences. Let any 
one deny this, and he must be a hard- 
ened, ignorant infidel, indeed. Great 
is the truth, and must prevail. See 
Dr. Iceland's .Yecessity of Revelation.

had no answer, and I am persuaded it

. REVENGE means the return of in- 
jury for injury, or the infliction of pain 
on another in consequence of an injury 
received from him, farther than the 
just ends of reparation or punishment 
require. Reverige differs materially 
from resentment, which rises in the 
mind immediately on being injured : but 
revenge is a cool and deliberate wicked- 
ness, and is often executed years after 
the offence is given. By some it is con- 
sidered as a perversion of anger. Anger, 
it is said, is a passion given to man for 
wise and proper purposes, but revenge 
is the corruption of anger ; is unnatural, 
and therefore ought to be suppressed. 
It is observable that the proper object 
of anger is vice ; but the object in ge- 
neral of revenge is man. It transfers the 
hatred due to the vice to the man, to 
whom it is not due. It is forbidden bv 
the Scriptures, and is unbecoming the 
character and spirit of a peaceful fol- 
lower of Jesus Christ. See Anger. 

REVEREND, venerable ; deserving 
awe and respect. It is a'title of respect 
given to ecclesiastics. The religious 
abroad are called reverend fathers; and 
abbesses, piioresses, &amp;c. reverend mo- 
thers. In England, bishops are right 
reverend, and archbishops most rever- 
end ; private clergymen, reverend. In 
France, before the revolution, their bi- 
shops, archbishops, and abbots, were all 
alike, most reverend. In Scotland, the 
clergy individually are, reverend; a 
synod is, very reverend ; and the gene- 
ral assembly i.s, venerable. The Dis- 
senters, also, in Esgland have the title 
of reverend ; though some of them sup- 
pose the term implies too much to be 
given to a mere creature, and that of 
God only it may be said with propriety, 
"Holy and reverend is his namei" 
Psalm cxi. 4. 

REVERENCE, awful regard; an act 
of obeisance ; a submissive and humble 
deportment. See Lord's Name taken 
IN Vain. 

RIGHTEOUSNESS, justice, holi- 
ness. The righteousness of 'God is the 
absolute and essential perfections of his 
nature ; sometimes it is put for his jus- 
tice. The righteousness of Christ de- 



notes not only his absolute perfections, 
but is taken for his perfect obedience 
to the law, and suffering the penalty 
thereof in our stead. The righteous- 
ness of the law is that obedience which 
the law requires. The righteousness of. 
faith is the righteousness of Christ as 
received by faith. The saints have a 
threefold righteousness. 1. The right- 
eousness of their persons, as in Christ, 
his merit being imputed to them, and 
thev accepted on tlie account thereof, 
2 Cor. v. 21. Eph. v. 27. Isaiah, xlv. 
24. — 2. Tlie righteousness of their prin- 
ciples being derived' from, and formed 
accoi-ding to the nile of right, Psalm 
cxix. 11. — 3. The righteousness of 
their lives, produced by the sanctifying 
influence ot the Holy Spirit, without 
which no man shall see the Lord, Heb.

SABBATARIANS, those who keep 
the seventh day as the sabbath. They 
are to be found principally, if not wholly 
among the Baptists. They object to the 
reasons which are generally alleged for 
keeping the first day ; and assert, that 
the change from the seventh to the first 
was affected by Constantine on his con- 
version to Christianity. The three fol- 
lowing propositions contain a summary 
of their principles as to this article of 
tlie sabbath, by which they stand distin- 
guished. 1. That God hath required 
the observation of the seventh, or last 
day of every week, to be observed by 
mankind universally for the weekly 
sa])bath. — 2. That this command of 
God is perpetually binding on man till 
time shall be no more. — And, 3. That 
this sacred rest of the seventh-day sab- 
bath is not (by divine authority) chang- 
ed from the seventh and last to the first 
day of the week, or that the Scripture 
doth no where require the observation 
of any other day of the week for the 
weekly sabbath, but the seventh day 
only. They hold, in common with other 
Christians, the distinguishing doctrines 
of Christianity. There are two congre- 
gations of the Sabbatarians in London ; 
one among the general Baptists, meeting 
in Mill Yard ; the other among the par- 
ticular Baptists, in Cripplegate. There 
are, also, a few to be found in different 
parts of the kingdom, and some it is said, 
m America. A tract, in support of this 
doctrine, was published by Mr. Cornth- 
waite, in 1740. See Evans's Sketch 
of the Denominations of the Christian 
World; and books under next article. 



SABBATH, in tlie Hebrew language, 
signifies rest, and is tlie seventh day of 
the week : a day appointed for religious 
duties, and a total cessation from work, 
in commemoration of God's resting on 
the seventh day ; and likewise in memo- 
rial of the redemption of the Israelites 
from Egyptian bondage. 

Concerning the time when the sab- 
bath was first instituted there have been 
different opinions. Some have main- 
tained that the sanctification of the 
seventh day mentioned m Gen. ii. is 
only there spoken of &amp;\a ■KooXT\^iw, or by 
anticipation ; and is to be understood of 
the sabbath afterwards enjoined in the 
wilderness ; and that the historian, 
writing after it was instituted, there 
gives the reason of its institution ; and 
this is supposed to be the case, as it is 
never mentioned during the patriarchal 
age. But against this sentiment it is 
urged, 1. That it cannot be easily sup- 
posed that the inspired penman would 
have mentioned the sanctification of the 
seventh day among the primxval trans- 
actions, if such sanctification had not 
taken place until 2500 years afterwards. 
— 2. That considering Adam was re- 
stored to favour through a Mediator, . 
and a religious service instituted, which 
man was required to observe, in testi- 
mony not only of his dependence on the 
Creator, but also of his faith and hope 
in the promise, it seems reasonable that 
an institution so grand and solemn, and 
so necessary to the observance of this 
service, should be then existent. — "&gt;■ 
That it is no proof against its existewcc 
because it is not mentioned in the partvi- 



SAB 



537 



SAB 



archical age, no more than it is against 
its existence from Moses to the end of 
David's reign, which was near 440 
years. — 4. That the Sabbath was men- 
tioned as a well known solemnity before 
the promulgation of the law, Exodus, 
xvi. 23.- For the manner in which the 
Jews kept it, and the awful consequences 
of neglecting it, we refer tlie reader to 
the Old Testament, Lev. xxvi. 34, 35. 
Neh. xiii. 16, IS. Jer. xvii. 21. Ezek. 
XX. 16, 17. Numb. .XV. 23 — 36. 

Under the Christian dispensation, the 
sabbath is altered from the seventh to 
the first day of the week. The argu- 
ments for the change are these: 1. As 
the seventh day was observed by the 
Jewish church in memory of the rest of 
God after the works of the creation, 
"and their deliverance from Pharaoh's 
tyranny, so the first day of the week has 
always been observed by the Christian 
church in memory of Chi'ist's resur- 
rection. — 2. Christ made repeated visits 
to his disciples on that day. — 3. It is 
called the Lord's day, Rev. i.'lO. — 4. On 
this day the apostles were assem- 
bled, when the Holy Ghost came down 
so visibly upon them, to qualify them 
for the conversion of the world. — 5. On 
this day we find St. Paul preaching at 
TroaSjWhen the disciples came to break 
bread. — 6. The directions the apostles 
give to the Christians plainly allude to 
their religious assemblies on the first 
day. — 7. Pliny bears witness of the first 
day of the week being kept as a festival, 
in honour of the resurrection of Christ : 
and the primitive Christians kept it in 
tVie most solemn manner. 

These arguments, however, are not 
satisfactory to some, and it must be 
confessed that there is no law in the 
N^ Testament concerning the first 
day. However, it may be observed 
that it is not so much the precise time 
that is universally binding, as that one 
day out of seven is to be regarded. " As 
it is impossible," says Dr. Doddridge, 
"certainly to determine which is the 
seventh day from the creation ; and as, 
in consequence of the spherical fonn of 
the earth, and the absurdity of the 
scheme which supposes it one great 
plain, .the change of place will neces- 
sarily occasion some alteration in the 
time of the beginning and ending of any 
day in question, it being always at the 
same time, somewhere or other, sun- 
rising and sun-setting, noon and mid- 
night, it seems very unreasonable to lay 
such a stress upon the particular day as 
some do. It seems abundantly sufficient 
that there be six days of labour and one 
of religious rest, which there will be 



upon the Christian and the Jewish' 
scheme." v ' 

As the sabbath is of divine institution, 
so it is to be kept holy unto the Lord. 
Numerous have been the days appoint- 
ed by men for religious services ; but 
tliese are not binding, because of human 
institution. Not so the sabbath. Hence 
the fourth commandm-ent is ushered in 
with a peculiar emphasis — "Remctnber 
that thou keep holy the sabbath day.'" 
Thi^ institution is wise as to its ends : 
That God may be worshipped ; man 
instructed ; nations benefited ; and fa- 
milies devoted to the service of God. It 
is laslin^^as to its duratiori. The aboli- 
tion of It would be unreasonable ; un- 
spriptural, Exod. xxxi. 13 ; and every 
wa)'^ disadvantageous to the body, to so- 
ciety, to the soul, and even to the brute 
creation. It is, however, awfully vio^ 
lated by visiting, feasting, indolence, 
buying and selling, working, worldly 
amusements, and travelling. " Look in- 
to the streets," says bishop Porteus, 
" on the Lord's day, and see whether 
they convey the idea of a day of rest. 
Do not our sei-\"ants and our cattle seem 
to be almost as fully occupied on that 
day as on any other ? And, as if this was 
not a sufficient infringement of their 
rights, we contrive by needless enter- 
tainments at home, and needless jour- 
neys abroad, which are often by choice 
and inclination reserved for this very 
day, to take up all the little remaining 
part of their leisure time. A sabbath 
dav's journey was among the Jews a 
.])iTjverbiai expression for a very short 
one; among us it can have no such 
meaning affixed to it. That day seems 
to be considered by too many as set 
apart, by divine and human authority, 
for the purpose not of 7-est, but of its di- 
rect opposite, the labour of travelling, 
tlius adding one day more of torment to 
those generous but wretched animals 
whose services they hire ; and who, 
being generally strained bevond their 
strength the other six days of the week, 
have, of all creatures under heaven, the 
best and most equitable claim to sus- 
pension of labour on the seventh." 

These are evils greatly to be lament- 
ed ; they are an inSult to God, an injury 
to ourselves, and an awful example to 
our servants, our children, and our 
friends. To sanctify this day, we should 
consider it, 1. A day of rest ; not in- 
deed, to exclude works of mercy and 
charity, but a cessation from all labour 
and care. — 2. As a day oi remembrance; 
of creation, preservation, redemption. 
— 3. As a day of meditation and prayer 
in which we should cultivate commu*

SABELLIANS, a sect in the third 
century that embraced the opinions of 
Sabellius, a philosopher of Egypt, who 
openly taught that there is but one per- 
son in the Godhead. 

The Sabellians maintained that the 
Word and the Holy Spirit are only vir- 
tues, emanations, or functions of tlie 
Deity ; and held that he who is in hea- 
ven is the Father of all things ; that he 
descended into the Virgin, became a 
child, and was born of her as a son; 
and that, having accomplished the mys- 
tery of our salvation, he tlitfused liiin- 
self on the apostles in tongues of fire, 
and was then denominated the Holy 
Ghost. This they exphiincd by re- 
sembling God to the sun ; the illumina- 
ted virtue or quality of which was the 
Word, and its warming virtue the Holy 
Spirit. The Word, tliey taught, was 
darted, like a divine ray, to accomplish 
the work of redemption • and that, be- 
ing reasceaded to heaven, the influences 
of the Father were communicated alter 
a like manner to the apostles. 

SACOPHORI,a denomination in the 
fourth century, so called, because they 
always went dothed in sackcloth, and 
affected a great deal of austerity and 
penance. 

SACRAMENT is derived from the 
Latin word sacrarnentum, which signi- 
fies an oath, particularly the oath taken 
by soldiers to be true to their country 
and general. — The word was adopted 
by the writers of the Latin church, to 
denote those ordinances of religion by 
which Christians came under an obli- 
gation of obedience to God, and which 
obligation, they supposed, was equally 
sacred with tliat of an oath. [See V ow.] 
Of sacraments, in this sense of the woi-d, 
Protestant chiuxhes admit of but two ; 
and it is not easy to conceive how a 
greater number can be made out from 
Scripture, if the definition of a sacra- 



ment be just which is given by the 
church of England. By that church, 
the meaning of the word sacrament is 
declared to be " an oxitward and visible 
sign of an inward and spiritual grace 
given unto us, ordained by Christ him- 
self, as a means whereby we receive 
the same, and a pledge to assure us 
thereof." — According to this definition, 
baptism and the Lord's supper are cer- 
tainly sacraments, for each consists of 
an outward and visible sign of what is 
believed to be an inward and spiritual 
grace, both were ordained by Christ 
himself, and in the reception of each 
does the Christian solemnly devote him- 
self to the service of his divine Master. 
[See Baptism, and Lord's Supper.] 
The Romanists, however, add to this 
number con firmation, penance, extreme 
unction, ordination, and marriage, hold- 
ing in all seven sacraments. [See 
Popery.] Numerous, however, as the 
sacraments of tlie Romish church are, 
a sect of Chi^stians sprung up in Eng- 
land, early in tlie last century, who in- 
creased their number. The founder of 
this sect was a Dr. Deacon. According 
to these itien, every j-ite and every 
phrase, in the book called the Aposto- 
lical Constitutions, wei'e certainly in 
use among the aposjles themselves. 
Still, however, they make a distinction 
between the greater and the lesser sa- 
craments. Tlie gveattM" sacraments are 
only two, baptism and the Lord's sup- 
per. The lesser are no fewer than ten, 
viz. five belonging to baptism, exorcism, 
anointing with oil, the white garment, a 
taste of milk and honey, and aiiointing 
with chrism, or ointment. Tlie other 
five are, the sign of the cross, imposi- 
tion of hands, unction of the sick, holy 
I orders and matrimony. This sect, how- 
1 ever, if not extinguished, is supposed to 
1 be in its last wane. Its founder publish- 
i ed, in 1748, his full, true, and compre- 
hensive view of Christianity, in two 
catechisms, octavo. 

SACRAMENT ARIANS, a general 
name given foj- all such as have held 
erroneous opinions respecting the Lord's 
supper. The term is chiefly apphed 
among Catholics, by way of reproach 
to the Lutherans, Calvinists, and .other 
Protestants. 

SACRIFICE, an offering made to 
God on an altar, Ijy means of a regular 
minister : as an acknowledgment of his 
power, and a payment of homage. Sa- 
crifices (though the term is sometimes 
used to comprehend all the offerings 
made to God, or in any way devoted to 
his service and honour) differ from mere 
oblations in this, that in a sacrifice there

Is a real destniction or cliaiigc of the 
thing offered ; whereas an obhition is 
only a simple offering or gift, without 
any such change at all : thus, all sorts of 
tithes, and first fruits, and wliatever of 
men's worldly substance is consecrated 
to God for the supjiort of his worship 
and the maintenance of his ministers, 
are offerings, or oblations ; and these, 
under the Jewish law, were either of 
living creatures, or other things ; but 
sacrifices, in the more peculiar sense of 
the term, were either wholly or in part 
consumed by fire. They have, by di- 
vines, been divided into bloody and un- 
bloody. Bloody sacrifices were made 
of living creatures ; unbloody, of the 
fruits of the earth. They have also been 
divided into exfiiatory, imfietratorij, 
and eucliar-istical. The first kind were 
offered to obtain of God the forgiveness 
of sins ; the second, to procure some fa- 
vour ; and the third, to express thank- 
fidness for favours already received. 
Under one or other of these heads may 
all sacrifices be arranged, though we 
are told that the Egy])t)ans had six hun- 
dred and sixty- six difTerent kinds ; a 
number sui-passing all crcdil)ility. Va- 
rious have been the opinions of the 
learned concerning the origin of sacri- 
fices. Some suppose that they had their 
origin in superstition, and were merely 
the inventions of men ; others, that they 
originated in the natural sentiments of 
the human heart; others imagine that 
God in order to pi-event their being of- 
fered to idols, introduced tliem into his 
service, though he did not approve of 
them as good in themselves, or as pro- 
per rites of worsliip. " But that animal 
sacrifices," says a learned author," were 
not instiftited by man, seems extremely 
evident from the acknowledged univer- 
mlitij of the practice ; from the wonder- 
ful same7ipss of the manner in which the 
whole world offered these sacrifices; 
and from the expiation which was 
constantly supposed to be effected-by 
them. 

" Now human reason, eyen among 
the most strenuous opponents of the di- 
vine institutions, is allowed to be incapa- 
ble of pointing out the least natural fi.t- 
ness or congruity between blood and 
atonement ; between killing of God's 
creatures and the receiving a pardon 
for the violation of God's laws. This 
consequence of sacrifices, when projjer- 
ly offered, was the invariable opinion of 
the heathens, but not the whole of their 
opinion in this matter ; for they had also 
a traditionary belief among them, that 
these animal sacrifices were not only 
expiations, but vicarious commutations. 



and substituted satisfactions ; and they 
called the animals so offered [their 
ai'Ti4xixa] the ransom of their souls. 

" But if these notions are so remote 
from, nay, so contrary to, any lessoji 
that nature teaches, as they confessedly 
are, how came the whole wqi'ld to prac- 
tise the rites founded upon them .'' It is 
certain that the wisest Heathens, Py- 
thagoras, Plato, Porphyry, and others, 
slighted the religion of such sacrificeSj 
and wondered how an institution so 
dismal (as it appeared to them,) and so 
big with absurdity, could diffuse itself 
through the world. — An advocate for 
the sufficiency of reason [Tindall] sup- 
poses the absurdity prevailed by de- 
grees ; and the priests who shared with 
their gods, and reserved the best bits 
for thcnnselves, had the chief hand in 
this gainful superstition. But, it may 
well be asked, who were the priests in 
the days of Cain and Abel ? Or, what 
gain could this superstition be to them, 
when the one gave away his fruits, and 
the other his animal sacrifice, without 
being at lil)crty to taste the least part 
of it .'' And it is worth remarking, that 
what this author wittily calls tlie best 
b'ltfi and appropriates to the priests, ap- 
pear to liave been the skin of the burnt- 
offering among the Jews, and the skin 
and feet among the Heatliens." 

Dr. Sj)encer observes [De Leg. Hcb. 
lib. iii. § 2.] that "sacrifices were look- 
ed upon as giftfs, and that the general 
opinion was, that gifts would have the 
same effect with God as with man ; 
would appease wrath, conciliate favour 
with the Deity, and testify the gratitude 
and affection of the sacrificer ; and that 
from this princijile proceeded expiatory, 
precatory, and eucharistical offerings. 
Tliis is all that is pretended fi-om natu- 
ral light to countenance this practice. 
But, how well soever the comparison 
may be thought to hold between sacri- 
fices and gifts, yet the opinion that sa- 
crifices would prevail with God nuist 
proceed from an observation that gift'; 
had prevailed with men; an observation 
this which Cain and Abel had little oj)- 
portunity of making. And if the coats 
of skin which God directed Adam to 
I make, wei'c the remains of sarritice;, 
sure Adam could not sacrifice fmhi this 
observation, when there wciv no sub- 
jects in the world upon which Ik- could 
make these observations," [Kennicott's 
second Dissert, on the Offerings of Cain 
and Abel, p. 201, Sec] 

But the grand objection to the divine 
origin of sacrifices is drawn from the 
Scriptures themselves, particularly tlic 
following [Jer. vii. 22, 23.] "1 spake not

to your fathers, nor commanded them, 
at the time that I brought them out of 
Egypt, concerning the matters of bunit- 
offerings or sacrifices ; but only this 
very thing commanded I them, saying, 
Obey my voice, cmd I will be your 
God, a?id ^ shall be 7ny peofile." "The 
ingenious writer abo\ e referred to, ac- 
counts for this passage [p. 153 and 209.] 
by referring to the transaction at Mavah, 
[JExod. XV. 23, 26,] at which time God 
spake nothing concerning sacrifices: it 
certainly cannot be intended to contra- 
dict the whole book of Leviticus, which 
is full of such appointments. Another 
learned author, to account for the above, 
and otlier similar passages, observes, 
' The Jews Avere diligent in perform- 
ing the external services of religion ; 
in offering prayers, incense, sacrifices, 
obi: 'ions: but these pravers were not 
offered with faith ; and "their oblations 
weix; made more frequently tft their 
idols than to the God of their fathers. 
The Hebrew idiom excludes with a ge- 
neral negative, in a comparative sense, 
one of two objects opposed to one ano- 
ther, thus : ' I will have niercy, and not 
sacrifice.' [Hosea, vi. 6.] Fo'i' I spake 
7iot to your fathers, 7ior commanded 
them, concerning burnt-offerings or sa- 
crifices; but this thing I commanded 
them, saying, Obey iny ■voice.'' " [Lowth 
on Isaiah, xliii. 22, 24.] The ingenious 
Dr. Doddridge remarks, that, accord- 
ing to the genius of the Hebrew lan- 
guage, one thing seems to be forbidden, 
and another commanded, when. the 
meaning only is, that the latter is ge- 
nerally to be preferred to the former. 
Tht text before us is a remarkable in- 
stance of this ; as likewise Joel, ii. 13. 
Matt. vi. 19j 20. John, vi. 27. Luke, 
xii. 4, 5. and Col. iii. 2. And it is evi- 
dent that Gen. xlv. 8. E:;^od. xvi. 8. 
John, V. 30. John, vii. 19. and many 
other passages, are to be expounded iii 
the same comparative sense. [Paraph, 
on the New Test. sect. 59.] So that 
the whole may be resolved into the 
apophthegm of the wise man. [Prov. 
x^i. 3 :] " To do justice and judgment 
is more ricceptable to the Lord thai) sa- 
crifice." See liennicott, above referred

SACRILEGE, the crime of pro- 
faning sacred things, or things devoted 
to God. The ancient church distin- 
guished several sorts of sacrilege. The 



first was the diverting things appropri- 
ated to sacred jiui-poses to other uses. — 

2. Robbing the graves, or defacing and 
spoiling the monuments of the dead.— 

3. Those were considered as sacrilegious 
persons who delivered up their Bibles 
a.nd the sacred utensils of the church to 
the Pagans, in the time of the Diocle- 
sian persecution. — 4. Profaning the sa- 
craments, churches, altars, Sec. — 5. Mo- 
lesting or hindering a clergyman in the 
performance of his office.-r— 6. Depriving 
men of the use of the Scriptures or the 
sacraments, particularly the cup in the 
eucharist. The Romish casuists ac- 
knowledge all these hut the last. 

SADDL^CEES, a famous sect among 
the Jews; so called, it is said, from 
their founder, Sadoc. It began in the 
time of Antigonus, of Socho, president 
of the Sanliedrim at Jerusalem, and 
teacher of the law in the principal di- 
vinity school of that city. Antigonus 
having often, in his lectures, inculcated 
to his scholars that they ought not to 
serve God in a servile manner, but only 
out of filial love and fear, two of his 
scholarsj Sadoc, and Baithus, thence in- 
ferred that tiiere were no rewards at all 
after this life; and, therefore, sepa- 
rating from the school of their master, 
they thought there was no resurrection 
nor future state, neither angel nor spi- 
rit. Matt. xxii. 23. Acts, xxiii. 8. 
Tliey seem to agi'ee greatly with the 
Epicureans ; differing however in this, 
that, though they denied a future state, 
yet they allowed the power of God to 
create the world ; whereas the follow- 
ers of Epicurus denied it. It is said 
also, that they rejected the Bible, ex- 
cept the Pentateuch ; denied predesti- 
nation ; and taught, that God had made 
man absolute master of all his actions, 
without assistance to good, or restraint 
from evil. 

SAINT, a person eminent for godli- 
ness. The word is genei-ally applied by 
us to the apostles and other holy per- 
sons mentioned in the Scriptures: but 
the Romanists make its application 
much more extensive ; as, according to 
them, all who are canonized are made 
saints of a high degree. See Canoni- 
zation. 

SALVATION means the safety or 
preservation of any thing that has been 
or is in danger ; but it is more particu- 
larly used by us to denote our deliver- 
ance from sin and hell, and the final 
enjoyment of God in a future state, 
through the mediation of Jesus Christ.

tion, Reconciliation, Redemption,

SAN- 



SAMARITANS, an ancient sect 
among the Jews, whose origin was in 
the time of king Rehoboam, under whose 
reign the people of Israel were divided 
into two distinct kingdoms, that of Ju- 
dah and that of Israel. The capital of 
the kingdom of Israel was Samaria, 
whence the Israelites took the name of 
Samaritans. Shalmaneser, king of As- 
syria, having besieged and taken Sama- 
ria, carried away all the people cap- 
tives into the remotest parts of his 
dominions, and filled their place with 
Babylonians, Cutheans, and other idol- 
aters. These, finding that they were 
exposed to wild beasts, desired that an 
Israelitish priest might be sent among 
them, to instruct them in the ancient re- 
ligion and customs of the land they in- 
habited. This being granted them, 
they were delivered from the plague of 
wild beasts, and embraced the law of 
Moses, with which they mixed a great 
part of their ancient idolatry. Upon the 
I'Cturn of the Jews from the Bab)'lonish 
captivity, it appears that they had en- 
tirely quitted the worship of their idols. 
But though they were united in reli- 
gion, they were not so in affection with 
the Jews ; for they employed \arious 
calumnies and stratagems to hinder their 
rebuilding the temple of Jerusalem ; 
and when they could not prevail, they 
erected a temple on Mount Gerizim, in 
opposition to that of Jerusalem. [See 
2 Kings, xvii. Ezra, iv. v, vi.] The Sa- 
maritans at present are few in number, 
but pretend to gi-eat strictness in their 
observation of the law of Moses. They 
are said to be scattered; some at Da- 
mascus, some at Gaza, and some at 
(irand Cairo, in Egypt. 

SAMARITAN ' PENTATEUCH, 
the collection of the five books of Mo- 
ses, written in Samaritan or Phoenician 
characters ; and, according to some, the 
ancient Hebrew characters which were 
in use before the captivity of Babylon. 
This Pentateuch was unknown in Eu- 
rope till the seventeenth centuiy, though 
quoted by Eusebius, Jerome, &amp;c. Arch- 
bishop Usher was the first, or at least 
among the fii'st, who procured it out of 
the East, to the number of five or six 
copies. Pietro della Valle jjuichased a 
very neat copy at Damascus, in 1616, 
for M. de Sansi, then ambassador of 
France at Constantinople, and after- 
wards bishop of St. Malo. This book 
was presented to the Fathers of the 
Oratory of St. Honore, where perhaps 
it is still preserved ; and from which 
father Morinus, in 1632, printed the first 
Samaritan Pentateuch, which stands 
in Le Jay's Polyglot, but more correctly 



in \\'alton's, from three Samaritan ma- 
nuscrijits, which belonged to Usher. 
The generality of divines hold, that the 
Samaritan Pentateuch, and that of the 
Jews, are one and the same work, writ- 
ten in the same language, only in differ- 
ent characters ; and that the difference 
between the two texts is owing to the 
inadvertency and in.accuracy of trans- 
cribers, or to the affectation of the Sa- 
maritans,' by intei-polating what might 
promote . their interests and preten- 
sions ; that the two cojjies were origi- 
nally the very same, and that the addi- 
tions were afterwards inserted. And 
in this respect the Pentateuch of the 
Jews must be allowed the preference to 
that of the Samaritans ; whereas othei's 
prefer the Sajiiaritan as an original, 
j)reserved in the same character and 
the same condition in which Moses left 
it. The variations, additions, and trans- 
positions which are found in the Sama- 
ritan Pentateuch, are carefully collected 
by Hottinger, and rtiay be seen on con- 
fronting the two texts in the last volume 
of the Ehgiish Polyglot, or by inspect- 
ing Kennicott's edition of the' Hebrew 
Bible, where the various readings are 
inserted. Some of these interpolations 
ser\e to illustrate the text ; others afe 
a kind of paraphrase, expressing at 
length what was only hinted at in the 
original ; and others, again, such as fa- 
vour their pretensions against the Jews ; 
namely, the putting Gerizim for Ebal. 
Besides the Pentateuch in Phcenician 
characters, there is another in the lan- 
guage which was spoken at the time 
that Manasseh, first high priest of the 
temple of Gerizim, and son-in-law of 
Sanballat, governor of Samaria, under 
the king of Persia, took shelter among 
the Samaritans. The language of this 
last is a mixture of Chaldee, Syriac, and 
Phoenician. It is called the Samaritan 
version, executed in favour of those 
who did not understand pure Hebrew ; 
and is a literal translation, expressing 
the text word for word. 

SANCTIFICATION, that work of 
God's grace, by which we are renewed 
after the image of God, set apart for his 
service, and enabled to die unto sin and 
live unto righteousness. It must be 
carefully considered in a two-fold light. 

1. As an inestimable privilege granted 
us from God, 1 Thess. v. 23! — And, 

2. As an all-comprehensive duty requii'- 
ed of us by his holy word, 1 Thess. iv. 

3. It is distinguished from justification 
thus : Justification changeth our state in 
law before God as a Judge ; sanctifica- 
tion changeth our heart and life before 
him as our Father. Justification pre-

cedes, and satictification follows, as the 
fruit and evidence of it. The surety - 
righteousness of Clirist imputed is our 
justifying righteousness ; but the grace 
of God implanted is the matter of our 
sanctification. Justification is an act 
done at once ; sanctification is a woi-k 
which is gradual. Justification removes 
the guilt of sin; sanctification the power 
of it. Justification delivers us from the 
avenging wrath of God ; sanctification 
ecMiforms us to his image. Yet justifica- 
tion and sanctification are inseparably 
connected in the promise of God, Rom. 
viii. 28 to 30 ; in the covenant of grace, 
Heb. viii. 10 ; in the doctrines and pro- 
mises of the Gospel, Acts, v. 31 ; and 
in the experience of all true believers, 
1 Cor. vi. 11. Sanctification is, 1. A di- 
vine work, and not to be begun or car- 
I'ied on by the power of man, Tit. iii. 5. 
— 2. A firogress-ive work, and not per- 
fected at once, Pi-ov. iv. 18. — 3. An in- 
ternal work, not consisting in external 
])rofessiun or bare morality, Psalms, li. 
0. — 4. A necessary work, necessary as 
to the evidence of our state, tile liononr 
of our characters, the usefulness of our 
lives, the happiness of our minds, and 
the hiternal enjoyment of God's pre- 
sence in a future world, John, iii. 3. 
Heb. xii. 14. Sanctification evidences 
itself by, 1. A holy reverence, Nehefii. 
v. 15. — 2. Earnest regard, Lam. iii. 24. 
— 3. Patient submission, Psal. xxxix. 
9. Hence Archl^ishoj) Usher said of it, 
'•Sanctification is nothing less than for 
a man to be broiiglit to an entire resig- 
nation of his will to the will of God, and 
to live in the ofi^ering up of his soul con- 
tinually in the flames of love, and as a 
whole burnt-oftering to Christ." — 4. In-

SANDRMANIANS, a sect that ori- 
ginated in Scotland about the year 1758 ; 
■where it is, at this time, distinguished 
by the name of Glassites, after its foun- 
der, Mr. John Glass, who was a minis- 
tef of the established church in that 



kingdom ; but being charged with a de- 
sign of subverting the national cove- 
nant, and sapping the foundation of all 

i national establishments, by maintaining 
that the kingdo?n of Christ is not of this 
world, was expelled from the synod by 
the church of Scotland. His sentiments 
are fully explained in a tract, published 
at that time, entitled, " The Testimony 
of the King of Martyrs," and preserved 
in the first volume of his works. In 
consequence of Mr. Glass's expulsion, 
his adherents formed themselves into 
churches, conformable, in their institu- 
tion and discipline, to what they ap- 
prehended to be the plan of the first 
churches recorded in the New Testa- 
ment. Soon after the year 1755, Mr. 
Robert Sandeman, an elder in one of 
these churches in Scotland, published a 
series of letters addressed to Mr. Her- 
vey, occasioned by his Theron and As- 
pasio, in which he endeavours to show 
that his notion of faith is contradictory 
to the Scrijjture account of it, and could 
only serve to lead men, professedly 
holding the doctrines called Calvinistic, 
to establish their own righteousness upon 
their frames, feelings, and acts of faith. 
In these letters Mr. Sandeman attempts 
to prove that justifying faith is no more 
than a simple belief of the truth, or tlje 
divine testimony passively received by 
the understanding; and that this divine 
testimony carries in itself sufficient 
ground of hope to every one who be- 
lieves it, without any thing wrought in 
us, or done by us, to give it a particular 
direction to ourselves. 

\ Some of tlie popular preachers, as 
they were called, had taught that it was 
of the essence of faith to believe that 
Chri.st is ours ; but Mr. Sandeman con- 
tended, that that which is believed in 
true faith is the truth, and what would 
have been the truth though we had ne- 
ver believed it. They dealt largely in 
calls and invitations to repent and be- 
lieve in Chi-ist, in order to forgiveness ; 
but he rejects the whole of them, main- 
taining that the Gospel contained no of- 
fer but that of evidence, and that it was 
merely a record or testimony to be cre- 
dited. They had taught that though ac- 
ceptance with God, which included the 
forgiveness of sins, was merely on ac- 
count of the imputed righteousness of 
Christ, yet that none was accepted of 
God, nor forgiven, till he repented of 
his sin, and received Christ as the only 
Saviour ; but he insists that there is ac- 
ceptance with God through Christ for 
sinners, while such, or before "any 
act, exercise, or exertion of their minds 
whatsoever;" consequently before re-

pentance ; and that " a passive belief 
i&gt;f this quiets the guilty conscience, be- 
gets liope, and so lays the foundation for 
iove." It is by tliis passive belief of the 
truth that we', according to Mr. Sande- 
man are justified, and that boasting is 
excluded. If any act, exercise, or ex- 
ertion of the mind, were necessary to 
our being accepted of God, he conceives 
there would be whereof to glory ; and 
justification by faith could not be op- 
posed, as it is in Rom. iv. 4, 6, to justifi- 
cation by works. 

The authors to whom Mr. Sandeman 
refers, under the title of " popular 
preachers," are Flavel, Boston, Guthrie, 
the Erskines, Sec. whom he has treated 
with acrimony and contempt. " I would 
be far," says he, •" from refusing even 
to the popular preachers themselves 
what they so much grudge to otliers, — 
the benefit of the one instance of a 
hardened sinner finding mercy at last ; 
for I know of no sinnos more hardened, 
none greater destroyers of manknid, 
than they." There have not been want- 
ing writers, however, who have vindi- 
cated these ministers from his invec- 
tives, and have endeavoured to show 
that Mr. Sandeman's notion of faitli, by 
excluding all exercise or concurrence 
of the will with the Gospel way of sal- 
vation, confotmds the faith of devils 
'with that of Christiansj and so is calcu- 
lated to deceive the souls of men. It 
has also been observed, that though Mr. 
Sandeman admits of the acts of faith 
and love as fruits of believing the tmth, 
yet, " all his godliness consisting (as he 
acknowledges to Mr. Pike) m love to that 
nvhich first relieved him," it amounts 
to nothing but self-love. And as self- 
love is a stranger to all those strong af- 
fections expressed in the cxixth Psalm 
towards the law of God, he cannot ad- 
mit of them as the language of a good 
man, but applies the whole psalm to 
Christ, tliough the person speakihg ac- 
knowledges, that " before he was af- 
flicted, he went astray." Others have 
thought, that from the sam'e principle 
it were easy to account for the bitter- 
ness, pride, and contempt, which dis- 
tinguish the system ; for self-love, say 
they, is consistent with the greatest 
aversion to all beings, divine or human, 
excepting so far as they become subser- 
vient to us. 

The chief opinion and practices in 
which this sect differs from other Chris- 
tians, are, their weekly administration 
of the Lord's supper ; their love-feasts, 
of which every member is not only al- 
lowed but required to partake, and 
■wliich consist of their dining together at 



each other's houses in the interval be- 
tween tlie morning and afternoon ser- 
vice. Their kiss of charity used on this 
occasion at the adniissionof a new mem- 
ber, and at other times when they deem 
it necessary and proper ; their weekly 
collection before the Lord's supper, for 
the support of the poor, and defraying 
other expenses ; mutual exhortation ; 
abstinence from blood and things stran- 
gled ; washing each other's feet, when, 
as a deed of mercy? it might be an ex- 
pression of love, the precept concern- 
ing which, as well as other pi'ecepts, 
they understand literally: community of 
goods, so far as that e\ery one is to con- 
sider all that he has in his possession 
airtl power, liable to the calls of the 
poor and the church ; and the unlawful- 
ness of laying up treasures upon earth, 
by setting them apart for any distant, 
future, and uncertain use. They allow 
of public and private diversions, so far 
as they are unconnected with circum- 
stances really sinful; but apprehending 
a lot to lie sacred, disapprove of lot- 
teries, playing at caj'ds, dice, &amp;c. 

They maintain a plurality of elders, 
pastors, or bishops, in each church ; 
and the necessity of the presence of two 
elders in every act of discipline, and at 
the administration of the Lord's sup- 
per. 

In the choice of these elders, want of 
learning and engageirSent in trade are 
no STimcient objection, if qualified ac- 
cording to the instructions given to Ti- 
mothy and Titus ; but second marriages 
disqualify for the office ; and they are 
ordained by prayer and fasting, imposi- 
tion of hands, and giving the right hand 
of fellowship. 

In their discipline they are strict and 
severe, and think themselves obliged to 
separate from the communion and wor- 
ship of all such religious societies as ap- 
pear to them not to profess the simple 
tmth for their only ground of hope, and 
who do not walk in obedience to it. We 
shall only add, that in every transac- 
tion they' esteem unanimity to be abso- 
lutely necessary. See Glass's Testijnony

SARABAITES, wandering fanatics, 
or rather impostors, of the fourth cen- 
tury, who, instead of procuring- a sub- 
sistence by honest industry, travelled 
through various cities and provinces, 
and gained a niainten.mce by fictitious 
miracles, by selling relics to tlie multi- 
tude, and other frauds of a like nature. 

SATAN is a Ilelwew word, and sig- 
nifies an adversary, or enemy, and is 
commonly ajjjjlied in Scripture to the 
devil, or the chief of the tullen angels. 
" By collecting the passages," says Cru- 
den, " where Satan, or the devil, is 
mentioned, it may be obscr\'ed, that he 
fell from heaven with all his company; 
that God cast him down from thence 
for the punishment of his pride ; that, 
by his envy and malice, sin, death, and 
all other evils, came into the world ; 
that, liy the ]iermission of (iod, he ex- 
ercises a sort of government in tlie world 
over his subordinates, over apostate an- 
gels like himself; tliat God makes use 
of him to prove good lyen and chastise 
bad ones; that he is a lying spirit in the 
mouth of false propliets, seducers, and 
hei'etlcs ; that it is he, or some of his, 
that t&lt;n'ment or possess men ; that in- 
spire them with evil designs, as he did 
Da\id, when he suggested to him to 
number his people ; to Judas, to betray 
his Lord and Master ; and to Ananias 
and Sapphira, to conceal the price of 
their field. That he roves full of rage 
like a roaring lion, to tempt, to betray, 
to destroy, and to involve us in guilt and 
wickedness ; that his power and malice 
are restrained within certain limits, and 
controlled by the will of God. In a word, 
that he is an enemy to God and man, 
and uses his utmost endeavours to rob 
Ciodof his glory, and men of their souls." 
See articles Angkl, Devil,'Tempta- 
TiON. More particularly as to the 
temptations of Satan. 1. " He adapts 
them to' our temper and circumstances. 
— 2. He chooses the fittest season to 
tempt : as youtli, age, poverty, pros- 
perity, public devotion, after happy ma- 
nifestations ; or when in a bad frame ; 
after some signal source ; when alone, 
or in the jjresence of the object ; when 
unemployed and off our guard ; in 
death. — 3. He puts on the mask of reli- 
gious friendship, 2 Cor. xi. 14. Matt. 
IV. 6. Luke, ix. 50. Gen. iii. — i. He ma- 
nages temptation with the greatest sub- 
tlety. He asks but little at first ; leaves 
for a season in order to renew his a.t- 
tack. — 5. He leads men to sin witlr a 
hope of speedy repentance. — 6. He raises 



suitable instruments, bad habits, rela- 
tions, Cien. iii. Job, ii. 9, 10. See Gilfibi

SATANI ANS, a branch of the Mes- 
salians, who appeared about the year 
390. It is said, among other things that 
they believed the devil to be extremely 
powerful, and that it was much wiser to 
respect and adore than to curse him. 

SATISFACTION, in general, signi- 
fies the act of giving complete or periect 
pleasure. In the Christian system it de- 
notes tliat which Christ did and suffer- 
ed in order to satisfy divine justice, to 
secure the honours of tlie divine govern- 
ment, and thereby make an atonement 
for the sins of his people. Satisfaction 
is distinguished from merit thus : The 
satisfaction of Clirist consists in his an- 
swering the demands of the law on man 
whirli were consequent on the breach of 
it. These were answered by suffering 
its penaltv. The merit of Christ con- 
sists in what he did to fulfil what the 
law demanded, before man sinned, 
which was obedience. The satisfaction 
of, Clirist is to free us from misery, and 
the merit of Christ is to purchase hap- 
piness for us. See Atonement and 
Pkoi'Itiation. 'Also Dr. Owen on the 
Satisfaction of Cfuist ; Gill's Body of

S.YTURNIANS, a denomination 
which arose about the year 115. They 
derived their name from Saturnius oV 
Antioch, one of the principal Gnostic 
chiefs. He held the doctrine of two 
principles, whence proceeded all things; 
the one, a wise and benevolent Deity, 
and the other, matter, a principle es- 
sentially evil, and which he supposed 
acted under the superintendence of a 
certahi intelligence of a malignant na- 
ture. 

The world and its inhabitants were, 
according to the system of Saturnius, 
created by seven angels, which presided 
over the seven planets. This work was 
carried on without the knowledge of 
the benevolent Deity, and in oppcisition 
to the will of the material principle. 
The former, however, beheld it with 
approbation, and honoured it with se- 
veral marks of his beneficence. He 
endowed with rational souls thq beings 
who inliabited this new system, to 
whom their creators had imparted no- 
thing more than tlie animal life ; and.

liaving divided the world into seven 
parts, lie distributed them among the 
seven angelic architects, one of whom 
was the God of the Jews, and reserved 
to himself the supreme empire over all. 
To these creatures, whom the benevo- 
lent principle had endowed with rea- 
sonable souls, and with dispositions that 
led to goodness and virtue, the evil be- 
ing, to maintain his empire, added ano- 
tlier kind, whom he formed of a wicked 
and malignant character: and hence 
the differences we see among men. 
When the creatures of the world fell 
fi-om their allegiance to the supreme 
Deity, God sent from heaven into our 
globe a restorer of order, whose name- 
was Christ. This divine Conqueror 
came clothed with a corporeal appear- 
ance, but not with a real body. He 
came to destroy the empire of the ma- 
terial principle, and to point out to vir- 
tuous souls the way by which they must 
return to God. This way is beset v/ith 
difficulties and sufferings, since those 
souls who propose returning to the Su- 
preme Being must aljstain from wine, 
ttesh, wedlock, and in short from every 
thing that tends to sensual gratification 
or even bodily refreshment. See Gnos- 
tics. 

SAVIOUR, a person who delivers 
from danger and miseiy. Thus Jesus 
Christ is called the Saviour, as he de- 
livers us from the greatest evils, and 
brings us into the possession of the 
greatest good. See Jesus Christ, 
Liberty, Propitiation, Redemp- 
tion. 

Order of St. Saviour, a religious or- 
der of the Romish church, founded by 
St. Bridget, about the year 1345 ; and so 
called from its being pretended that our 
Saviour himself declared its constitu- 
tion and i-ules to the foundress. 

SAVOY CONFERENCE, a confer- 
ence held at the Savoy, 1661, between 
the episcopal divines and the Presbyte- 
rians, in order to review the book of 
Common Prayer; but which was car- 
ried on the side of the Episcopalians.

SCEPTIC, (TKCffTixos, from crxEffTonai, 

" I consider, look about, or deliberate," 
properly signifies considerativc and in- 



quisitive ; or one who is always weigh- 
ing reasons on one side or the other, 
without ever deciding between them. — 
The word is applied to an ancient sect 
of philosophers founded by Pyrrho, 
who denied the real existence of all 
qualities in bodies, except those which 
are essential to primary atoms; and re- 
ferred every thing else to the jiercep- 
tions of the mind produced by external 
objects; in other words, to appearance 
and opinion. In modern times the word 
has been applied to Deists, or those 
wlio doubt of the truth and authenticity 
of the sacred Scriptures. One of the 
greatest sceptics m later times was 
Hume ; he endeavoured to introduce 
doubts into every branch of phvsics, 
metaphysics, history, ethics, and theo- 
logy. He has been confuted, however, 
by the doctors, Reid, Campbell, Grego- 
ry, and Beattie. See Infidelity. 

SCHEWENKFELDIANS, a deno- 
mination in the sixteenth century ; so 
called from one Gasper Schewenkfeldt, 
a Sik'sian knight. He differed from 
Luther in the three following points. 
The ^first of these points related to 
the doctrine concerning the eucharist, 
Schewenkfeldt inverted the following 
words of Christ,. This is my b'odij : 
and insisted in their being thus under- 
stood. My body is this, i. e. such as this 
bread which is broken and consumed ; 
a true and real food, which noui^sheth, 
satisfieth, and delighteth the soul. My 
blood is this, that is, such its effects, as 
the wine wliich strengthens and refresh- 
eth the heart. Secondly, He denied 
that the eternal word which is commit- 
ted to writing in the holy Scriptures 
was endowed with the power of heal- 
ing, illuminating, and renewing the 
mind ; and he ascribed this power to 
the internal word, Avin'ch,- according to 
his notion, was Christ himself. Thirdly, 
He would not allow Christ's human na- 
ture, in its exalted state, to be called a 
creature, or a created substance, as 
such a denomination appeared to hirti 
infinitely below its majestic dignity ; 
united as it is in that glorious state with 
the divine es.scnce. 

SCHISM, fi-om rrjittis.a, a rent, clift, 
fissure; in its general ^acceptation it 
signifies division or separation ; but is 
chiefly used in speaking of «epai'ations 
happening from diversity of opinions 
among peojile of the same religion and 
faith. AH separations, however, must 
not, properly speaking, be considered as 
schisnns. 

Schism, savs Mr. Arch. Hall, is, pixi- 
perly, a division among those who stand 
m one connection of fellowship : but

where the difference is earned so far, 
that the parties concerned entirely 
break up all communion one with ano- 
ther, and go into distinct connections 
for ol)taining the general ends of that 
religious fellowship which they once 
did, but now do not carry on and pursuf. 
with united endeavours, as one church 
joined in the bonds of individual society ; 
where this is'the case, it is undeniable 
there is something very different fi-om 
schism : it is no longer a schism in, but 
a separation from, the body. Dr. Camp- 
bell supposes that the word schism in 
Scripture does not always signify open 
separation, but that men may be guilty 
of schism l:)y such an alienation of affec- 
tion from their brethren as violates the 
internal union subsisting in the hearts of 
Christians, though there be no error in 
doctrine, nor separation from commu- 
nion. See 1 Cor. iii. 3, 4. 1 Cor. xii. 24 
—26. 

The great schism of the West is that 
Avhich happened in the times of Clement 
VII. and Urban VI, which divided the 
church for forty or fifty years, and was 
at length ended by the election of Mar- 
tin V. at the council of Constance. 

The Romanists number thirty-four 
schisms in their church : they bestow the 
name English schism on the refonna- 
tion of religion in this kingdom. Those 
of the church of England apply the 
term schism to the separation of the 
Presbyterians, Independents, Anabap- 
tists, and Methodists. 

" The sin of schism" says the learn- 
ed Blackstone, " as such, is by no 
means the object of temporal coercion 
and punishment. — If, through weakness 
of intellect, through misdirected piety, 
through pcrverseness and acerbity of 
temper, or tlirough a prospect of secu- 
lar advantage in herding with a party, 
men qviarrcl with the ecclesiastical es- 
tablishment, the civil magisti-ate has no- 
thing to do Avith it ; unless their tenets 
and practice are such as threaten ruin 
or disturbance to the state. All perse- 
cution for diversity of opinions, however 
ridiculous and absurd they may be, is 
contrary to every principle of sound po- 
licy and civil freedom. The names and 
subordination of the clerg}', the posture 
of devotion, the materials and colour of 
a minister's garment, the joining in a 
known or unknown form of jjrayer, and 
other matters of the same kind, must 
be left to the option of eveiy main's pri- 
vate judgment." The following have 
been proposed as remedies for schism. 
" 1. Be disposed to su]:)port your breth- 
ren by all the friendly attentions in your 
power, speaking justly of their preach- 



ing and character. Never withhold 
these proofs of your brotherly love, un- 
less they de])art from the doctrines or 
spirit of the Gospel. — 2. Discountenance 
the silly leports you may hear, to the in- 
jury of any of your brethren. Oppose 
backbiting and slander to the utmost. — 
3. Whenever any brother is sinking in 
the esteem of his flock through their ca- 
price, pcrverseness, oi- antinomianism, • 
endeavour to hold up 4iis hands and his 
heart in his work. — 4. Never espouse 
the part of the factious schismatics, till 
you have heard your brother's account 
of their conduct. — 5. In cases of an open 
separation, do not preach for separatists 
till it be evident that God is with them. 
Detest the thought of wounding a bro- 
ther's feelings through the contemptible 
influence of a party spirit ; for through 
this abomir.able principle, schisms are 
sure to be multiplied. — 6. Let the symp- 
toms of disease in the patients, arouse 
the benevolent attention of the physi- 
cians. Let them check the froward, 
humble the proud, and warn the un- 
ruly ; and many a schismatic distemper 
will receive timely cure. — 7. Let elderly 
ministers and tutors of academies pay 
more attention to these things, in pro- 
portion as the disease may prevail ; for 
much good may be accomplished by 
their influence.?' See Ki&gt;;^ on (lie Pri-

SCHOLASTIC DIVINITY, is that 
part or species of divinity which deal's 
and discusses questions by reason and 
argument; in wiiich sense it stands, in 
some measure, opposed to /lositive di- 
vinity, which is founded on the authoritv 
of fathers, councils, &amp;c. The school 
divinity is now fallen into contempt, and 
is scarcely regarded any where' but in 
some of the universities, where they 
are still by their charters obliged to 
teach it. 

SCHOOLMEN, a sect of men, in 
the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth 
centuries, who framed a new sort of di- 
vinity, called Scholastic Theologv. [See 
last article.] Their divinity was found- 
ed upon, and confirmed by, the philoso- 
phy of Aristotle, and lay, says Dr. Gill, 
in contentions and litigious disputations, 
in thorny questions and subtle distinc- 
tions. Their whole scheme was chiefly

SCRIBE. This word has different 
significations in Scripture. 1. A clerk,

— 2. A commissary, or muster-master

SCRIPTURE is a word derived from 
the Latin scri/itura, and in its original

tention of the mightiest minds in the 



middle ages. Acute in the highest de- 
gree, and endued with a wonclei'ful pa- 
tience of thinking, they yet, by a mis- 
taken direction of their powers, wasted 
themselves in endless logoniachies, and 
displayed more of a teazing subtlety 
than of philosophical depth. They 
chose rather to strike into the dark and 
intricate by-paths of metaphysical sci- 
ence, than to pursue a career of useful 
discovery ; and as their disquisitions 
were neither adorned by taste, nor reai'- 
ed on a basis of extensive knowledge, 
they gradually fell into neglect, when 



however, commonly used to denote the 
writings of the Old and New Testa- 
ments, which are called sometimes the 
Snifitures, sometimes the sacred or ho- 
ly Scriptures, and sometimes canonical 
Scrifitures. These books ai'e called the 
Scriptures by way of eminence, as they 
are the most important of all writings. — 
They are said to be holy or sacred on 
account of the sacred doctrines which 
they teach ; and they are termed ca- 
nonical, because, when their number and 
authenticity were ascertamed, their 
names were inserted in ecclesiastical 
canons, to distinguish them fi-om other

I'ous of human reg-ard, that they ex- 
posed to the world the meanness of their 
oh'th and occupations, tlieir great igno- 
rance and scandalous falls. Add to this 
that they were so man}', and lived at 
such distance of time and place from 
each other, that, had they been impos- 
to)'s, it would have been impracticable 
for them to contrive and carry on a for- 
gery without being detected. And, as 
they neither would nor could deceive 
the world, so they neither could nor 
would be deceived themselves ; for they 
were days, months, and years, eye and 
ear-witnesses of the things which they 
i-elate ; and, when they had not the 
fullest evidence of important facts, they 
insisted upon new proofs, and even upon 
sensible demonstrations ; as, for in- 
stance, Thomas, in the matter of our 
Lord's resurrection, John xx. 25 ; and 
to lea^'e us no room to question their 
sincerity, most of them joyfully sealed 
the truth of their doctrines with their 
own blood. Did so many and such 
iTiarks of veracity ever meet in any 
other authors ? 

" 2. But even while they lived, they 
confirmed their testimony by a variety 
of miracles wrought in divers places, 
and for a number of years, sometimes 
before thousands of their enemies, as 
the miracles of Christ and his disciples ; 
sometimes before hundreds of thousands, 
as those of Moses, (See Miracle.) 

"3. Reason itself dictates, that nothing 
but the plainest matter of fact coidd in- 
duce so many thousands of prejudiced 
and persecuting Jews to embrace the 
humbling self-denying doctrine of the 
cross, which they so much despised and 
abhorred. Nothing but the clearest 
evidence arising from undoulited truth 
could make multitudes of lawless, luxu- 
i'ious heathens receive, follow, and 
transmit to posterity, the doctrine and 
writings of the ajjostles ; especially at 
■.i time when the vanity of their preten- 
.sions to miracles and the gift of tongues, 
could be so easily discovered, had they 
been impostors ; and when the profession 
'of Christianity exposed persons of all 
ranks to the greatest contempt and 
most imminent danger. 

*' 4. When the authenticity of the mira- 
cles was attested by thousands of living 
witnesses, religious rites were instituted 
a}»d performed by hundreds of thou- 
•sands, agi-eeable to Scripture injunctions, 
in order to perpetuate that authenticity : 
and these solemn ceremonies have ever 
since been kept up in all parts of the 
world ; the Passover by the Jews, in 
remembrance of Moses's miracles in 
Egypt; and the Eucharist by Chris- 



tians, as a memorial of Christ's death, 
and the miracles that accompanied it, 
some of which are recorded by Phlegon 
theTrallian, an heathen historian. 

" 5. The Scriptures have not only the 
external sanction of miracles, but the 
^temal stamp of the omniscient God by 
a variety of prophecies, some of which 
have alreadv been most exactly con- 
firmed by the eveijt predicted. (See 

PROl'HF.Cy.) 

" 6. The scattered, despised people, 
the Jews, the irreconcileable enemies 
of the Christians, keep with amazing 
care the Old Testament, full of the pro- 
phetic history of Jesus Christ, and by 
that means afford the world a striking- 
proof that tlie New Testament is tine ; 
and Christians, in their turn, show that 
the Old Testament is abundantly con- 
firmed and explained by the New. (See 
Jews, § 4.) 

" 7. To say nothing of the harmony, 
venerable an1:iquity, and wonderful pre- 
servation of those books, some of which 
are by far the most ancient in the world ; 
to pass over the inimitable simplicity 
and true sublimity of their stjle ; the 
testimony of the fathers and the pri- 
mitive Christians ; they carry Avith 
them such characters of truth, as com- 
mand the respect of every unprejudiced 
reader. 

"They open to us the mysteiy of the 
creation ; the nature of fiod, angels, 
and man ; the immortality of the soulj 
the end for which we were made ; the 
origin and connexion of moral and na- 
tural evil ; the vanity of this world, and 
the glory of the next. There we see 
inspired shepherds, tradesmen, and fish- 
ermen, surpassing as much the greatest 
philosophers, as these did the herd of 
mankind, both in meekness of wisdom 
and sublimity of doctrine. — There we 
admire the purest morality in the world, 
agreeable to the dictates of sound rea- 
son, confirmed by the witness which 
God has placed for himself in our breast, 
and exemplified in the lives of men of 
like passions with ourselves. — There 
we discover a vein of ecclesiastical his- 
tory and theological truth consistently 
ruiming through a collection of sixty-six 
different books, written by various au- 
thors, in different languages, during the 
space of above 1500 years. — There we 
find, as in a deep and pure spring, all the 
genuine drops and streams of spiritual 
knowledge which can possibly be met 
with in the largest libraries. — There the 
workings of the human heart ai-e de- 
scribed in a manner that demon.strate the 
inspiration of the Searcher of hearts. 
— There we have a particular account

of all our spiritual maladies, with their 
various symptoms, and tlie mctliod of a 
certain cure ; a cure that has been 
witnessed by multitudes of martyrs and 
departed saints, and is now enjoyed by 
thousands of good men, who would ac- 
count it an honour to seal the tnith of 
the Scriptures with their own blood. — 
There you meet with the noblest strains 
of penitential and joyous devotion, adapt- 
ed to the dispositions and states of all 
ti'avellers to bion&lt; — And there you read 
those awful threatenings and cheering 
promises which are daily fulfilled in the 
consciences of men, to the admiration of 
believers, and the astonishment of at- 
tentive infidels. 

" 8. The wonderful efficacy of the 
Scriptures is another proof that they are 
of God. When they are faithfully open- 
ed by his ministers, and powerfully ap- 
plied by his Spirit, they ivound and 
heal, they kill and make alive ; they 
alarm the careless, direct the lost, sup- 
port the tempted, strengthen the weak, 
comfort mourners, and nourish pious 
souls. 

" 9. To conclude : It is exceedingly 
remarkable, that the more humble and 
holy people are, the more they read, 
admire, and Aalue the Scriptures : and, 
on the contrary, the more self-conceit- 
ed, woi'ldly-minded, and wicked, the 
more they neglect, despise, and asperse 
them. 

" As for the objections which are 
raised against their perspicuity and con- 
sistency, those who are both pious and 
learned, know that they are generally 
founded on prepossession, and the want 
of understanding in spiritual thines ; or 
on our ignorance of several customs, 
idioms, and circumstances, which were 
perfectly known when those books were 
written. Frecjuently, also, the imma- 
terial error arises mei-ely from a wrong 
punctuation, or a mistake of copiers, 
printers, or translators; as the daily 
discoveries of pious critics, and inge- 
nious confessions of unprejudiced enqui- 
rers, abundantly prove." 

To understand the Sci'iptures, says 
Dr. Campbell, we should, 1. Get ac- 
quainted with each writer's style. — 
2. Inquire carefully into the character, 
the situation, and the office of the wri- 
ter; the time, the place, the occasion 
of his writing ; and the people for whose 
immediate use he originally intended 
his work. — 3. Consider the principal 
scope of the book, and the particulars 
chiefly observable in the method by 
which the writer has puvposed to exe- 
cute his design.— 4. Where the phrase 
is obscure, the context must be con- 



sulted. This, however, will not always 
answer. — 5. If it do not, consider whe- 
ther the phrase be any of the writer's 
I peculiarities : if so, it must be inquired 
1 what is the acceptation in which he em- 
ploys it in other places. — 6. If this be not 
sufficient, i-ccourse should be had to the 
parallel passages, if there be any such, 
in the other sacred wi'iters. — 7. If this 
throws no light, consult the New Tes- 
tament and the Septuagint, where the 
word may be used. — 8. If the term be 
only once used in Scripture, then recur 
to the ordinary acceptation of the term 
in classical authors. — 9. Sometimes re- 
ference may be had to the fathers.-^— 
10. The ancient versions, as well as mo- 
dern scholiasts, annotators, and transla- 
tors, may be consulted. — 11. The analo-' 
gy of faith, and the etymology of the 
word, must be used with caution. 

Above all, let the reader unite prayer 
with his endeavours, that his under- 
standing may be illuminated, and his 
heart impressed with the great truths 
which the sacred Scriptures contain. 

As to the fuiblic reading of the Sc7-ifi- 
tures, it may be remarked, that this is a 
very laudable and necessary practice. 
"One circumstance," as a writer ob- 
serves, " why this should be attended to 
in congregations is, that numbers of the 
hearers, in many places, cannot read 
them themselves, and not a few of them 
never hear them read in the families 
where they reside. It is strange that 
this has not long ago struck e\er\' per- 
son of the least reflection in all our 
churches, and especially the ministers, 
as a most conclusive and irresistible ar- 
gument for the adoption of this prac- 
tice. 

" It surely would be better to abridge 
the ]3reachhig and singing, and even the 
prayers, to one half of their length or 
more, than to neglect the public read- 
ing of the Scriptures. Let these things, 
therefore, be duly considered, together 
with the following reasons and observa-" 
"tions, and let the reader judge and de- 
ternaine the case, or the matter, foi 
himself. 

" Remember that God no sooner 
caused any part of his will, or word, to 
be written, than he also commanded the 
same to be read, not only in the family, 
but also in the congregation, and that 
even when all Israel were assembled to- 
gether (the men, women, and children, 
and even the strangers that were within 
their gates;) and the end was, that they 
might hear, and that they might learn, 
and fear the Lord their- God, and ob- 
serve to do all the ivords of his laiv, 
Deut. xxxi. 1?-

« Afterward, when sijtia^o^ues were 
erected in the land of Israel, that the 
people might every Sabliath meet to 
worship God, it is well known that the 
public reading of the Scripture was. a 
main part of the service there per- 
foiTncd : so much so, that no less than 
three-fourths of the time was generally 
employed, it seems, in reading and ex- 
pounding the Scriptures. Even the 
prayers and songs used on those occa- 
sions appear to have been all subser- 
vient to that particular and principal 
em])loyment or service, the reading of 
the law. 

'" This work, or practice, of reading 
the Scripture in the congregation, is 
warranted, and recommended in the 
*New Testament, as well as in the Old. 
As Christians, it is fit and necessary 
that we should first of all look tinto 
Jesus, who is the author and finisher of 
ouv faith. His example, as well as his 
precepts, is full of ]ji-*ecicms and most 
important instruction ; and it is a re- 
markal)le circumstance, which ought 
never to be forgotten, that he began his 
public nwiistry, in the synagogue of Na- 
zareth, by reading a fiortion of Scri/i- 
ture out of the Look of the prophet 
Isaiah; Luke, iv. 15. — 19. This alone, 
one would think, might be dtemed quite 
sufficient to justify tlie practice among 
his disciples through all succeeding 
ages, and even inspire them with zeal 
for its constant observance. 

"The apostle Paul, in pointing out to 
Timothy his ministerial duties, particu- 
larly mentions reading, 1 Tim. iv. 13. 
Give attendance (says he) to reading, 
to exhortation, to doctrine, evidently 
distinguishing reading as one of the 
public duties incumbent upon Timothy. 
There can be no reason for sepai'ating 
these three, as if the former was only a 
private duty, and the othei-s public ones ; 
the most natural and consistent idea is, 
_that they wei-e all three public duties ; 
and that the reading here spoken of, 
was no other than the reading of the 
Scriptures in those Christian assemt)lies 
where Timothy was concerned, and 
%vhich the apostle would have him by 
no means to neglect. If the public 
reading of the Scriptures was so neces- 
sary and important in those religious 
assemblies which had Timothy for their 
minister, how much more must it be in 
our assemblies, and even in those which 
enjoy the labours of our most able and 
eminent ministers !"

SECEDERS, a numerous body of 
Presbyterians in Scotland, who have 
with(h-awn from the comnmnion of the 
established churcli. 

In 1732, more than forty ministers 
presented an address to the general 
assembly, specifying, in a variety of 
instances, what they considered to be • 
great defections from the established 
constitution of the church, and craving 
a redress of these grievances. A peti- 
tion to the same effect, subsci'ibed by 
se\'eral hundreds of elders and pi'ivate 
Christians, was offered at the same 
time ; but the assembh- refused a hear- 
ing to both, and enacted, that the elec- 
tion of ministers to vacant charges, 
where an accepted presentation did not 
take place, should be competent only to 
a conjunct meeting of elders and heri- 
tors, being Protestants. To this act 
many objections were made by num- 
bers of ministers and private Christians. 
They asserted that moi'e than thirty to 
one in every parish were not possessed 
of landed ])roperty, and were, on that 
account, deprived of what they deemed 
their natural right to choose their own 
pastoi's. It was also said that this act 
was extremely prejudicial to the honour 
and interest of the church, as well as to 
the edification of the people ; and, in 
fine, that it was directly contrary to the 
appointment of Jesus Christ, and the 
practice of the apostles, when they 
filled up the first vacancy in the aposto- 
lic college, and appointed the election of 
deacons and elders in the primitive

church. Many of those also who were 
thought to be the best friends of the 
church expressed their fears, that this 
act would nave a tendency to overturn 
the ecclesiastical constitution which was 
established at the revolution. 

Mr. Ebenezer Erskine, minister at 
Stirling, distinguished himself by a bold 
and determined opposition to the mea- 
sures of the assembly in 1732. Being at 
that time moderator of the synod of 
Perth and Stirling, he opened the meet- 
ing at Perth with a sermon from Psalm 
cxviii. 22. . " The stone which the 
builders refected, is become the head 
stone of the corner." In the course of 
his sermon, he remonstrated with no 
small degree of freedom against the act 
of the preceding assembly, with regard 
to the settlement of ministers ; and al- 
leged that it was contrary to the woi'd 
of God and the established constitution 
of the church. A formal complaint was 
lodged against him for uttering several 
oifensive expressions in his sermon be- 
foi-e the synod. IMany of the members 
declared that they heard him utter 
nothing but sound and seasonable doc- 
trine ; but his accusers, insisting on their 
complaint, obtained an appointment of 
committee of synod to collect what were 
called the offensive expressions, and to 
lay them before the next diet in writing. 
This was done accordingly ; and Mr. 
Erskine gave in his answers to every 
article of the complaint. After three 
day's warm reasomng on this affair, the 
synod, by a majority -of six, found him 
censurable ; against which sentence he 
protested, and appealed to the next ge- 
neral assembly. When the assembly 
met in May 1733, it confirmed the sen- 
tence of the synod, and appointed Mr. 
Erskine to be rebuked and admonislied 
from the chair. Upon which he pro- 
tested, that as the assembly had found 
him censurable, and had rebuked him 
for doing what he conceived to be agreea- 
ble to the word of God and the standards 
of the church, he should be at Itbertv to 
preach the same tniths, and to testify 
against the same or similar evils, on 
every proper occasion. To this pro- 
test Messrs. William Wilson, minister 
at Perth, Alexander Moncrief, minister 
at Abcrnethy, and James Fisher, minis- 
ter at Kinclaven, gave in a written ad- 
herence, imder the form of instrument ; 
and these four withdrew, intending to 
return to their respective charges, and 
act agreeably to their protest whenever 
they should have an opportunity. Had 
the affair rested here, there never would 
have been a secession ; but the assembly 
resolving to carry the process, cited | 



them by their officer, to compear next 
day. They obeyed the citation ; and a 
committee was appointed to retire with 
them, in order to persuade them to with- 
draw their protest. The committee 
having reported that they still adhered 
to their protest, the assembly ordered 
them to appear before the commission 
in August following, and retract their 
protest ; and, if they should not com- 
ply and testify their sorrow for their 
conduct, the commission was empower- 
ed to suspend them from the exercise 
of their ministry ,.with certification that, 
if thef should act contrary to the said 
sentence, the commission should pi'o- 
ceed to an higher censure. 

The commission met in August ac- 
cordingly ; and the four ministers, still 
adiiering to their protest, were suspend- 
ed from the exercise of their office, and 
cited to the next meeting of the com- 
mission in November following. From 
this sentence several ministers and el- 
ders, members of the commission, dis- 
sented. The commission met in No- 
vember, and the suspended ministers 
compeared. Addresses, representa- 
tions, and letters from several synods 
and presbyteries, relative to the business 
now before the commission, were re- 
ceived and read. The synods of Dum- 
fries, Murray, Ross, Angus and Mearns, 
Perth and Stirling, craved that the com- 
mission would delay pi'oceeding to a 
higher censure. The synods of Gallo- 
way and Fife, as also the presbytery of 
Dornoch, addressed the commission for 
lenity, tenderness, and forbearance to- 
wards the suspended ministers ; and 
the presbytery of Abei-deen repi-esent- 
ed, that, in their judgment, the sentence 
of suspension inflicted on the aforesaid 
ministers was too high, and that it was 
a stretch of ecclesiastical authority. 
Many members of the commission rea- 
soned in the same manner, and alleged, 
that the act and sentence of last assem- 
bly did not oblige them to proceed to a 
higher censure at this meeting of the 
commission. The question, however, 
was put, — Proceed to a higher censure 
or not ^ and the votes tieing numbered, 
were found equal on both sides : upon 
which Mr. John Goldie, the moderator, 
gave his casting vote to proceed to a 
higher censure ; which stands in their 
minutes in these words : — "The com- 
mission did and hereby do loose the re- 
lation of Mr. Ebenezer Erskine, minis- 
ter at Stirling, Mr. William Wilson, 
minister at Perth, Mr. Alexander Mon- 
crief, minister at Abeniethy, and Mr. 
James Fisher, minister at Kinclaven, to 
their respective charge, and declare

them no longer ministers of this church ; 
and do ht t eby prohibit all ministers of 
this church to employ them, or any of 
them, in any ministerial function. And 
the commission do declare the churches 
of the said niinisters vacant from and 
after the date of this sentence." 

This sentence being intimated to 
them, they protested that the'r minis- 
terial office and relation to their respec- 
tive charges should be held as valid as 
if no such sentence had passed ; and 
that they were now obliged to make a 
Becesaion from the prevailing psi'ty in 
the ecclesiastical courts ; and that it 
shall be lawful and warrantable for tht m 
to preach the Gospel, and discharge 
every branch of the pastoral office, ac- 
cording to tlie word of God, and the 
established principles of the church of 
■ Scotland. Mr. Raljjh Erskine, minister 
at Dunfermline, Mr. Thomas Mail-, 
minister at Orwel, Mr. John M'Laren, 
minister at Edinl)urgh, i\Ir. John Cur- 
rie, minister at Kinglassie, Mr. James 
Wardlaw, minister at Dunfermlijie, and 
Mr. I'homas Narin, minister at .Abbot- 
shall, protested against the sentence of 
the commission, and that it should be 
lawful for them to complain of it to any 
subsequent general assembly of the 
church. 

The secession properly commenced 
at tliis date. And accordingly the eject- 
ed ministers declared in their protest, 
that tliey were laid imder the disagreea- 
ble necessity of seceding, not from the 
principles and constitution of the church 
of Scotland, to which, they said, they 
steadfastly adhered, but from the pre- 
sent church-courts, which had thrown 
them out from ministerial communion. 
The assembly, however, which .met in 
May 1734, did so far modify the above 
sentence, that they empowered the sy- 
nod of Perth and Stirling to receive the 
ejected ministers into the communion of 
the church, and restore them to their 
respective charges ; but with this ex- 
press direction, "that the said synod 
should not take upon them to judge of 
the legality or formality of the former 
procedure of the church judicatories in 
relation to this affair, or either approve 
or censure the same." As this a.ppoint- 
ment neither condemned the act of the 
preceding assembly, nor the conduct of 
the commission, the seceding ministers 
considered it to be rather an act of 
grace tlian of justice ; and therefore, 
they said, they could not return to the 
church-courts upon this ground ; and 
they published to the world the reasons 
of their refusal, and the terms upon 
which they were willing to return to the 



communion of the established church. 
They now erected themselves into an 
ecclesiastical court, which they called 
tlie dissociated Presbytery, and preach- 
ed occasionally to numbers of the peo- 
ple who joined them in different parts of 
the country. The'y also published what 
they called an Act, Declaration, and 
Testinumy, to the doctrine, worship, 
government, and discipline of the church 
of Scotland ; and against sev^eral in- 
stances, as they said, of defection from 
these, both in former and in the present 
times. Some time after this, several 
ministers of the established church join- 
ed tliem, and the Associated Presbytery 
now consisted of eight ministers. But 
the general assembly which met in 
1738, finding that the number of Se- 
coders was much increased, ordered the 
eight ministers to be served with a libel, 
and to be cited to the next meeting of 
the assembly, in 1739. They now ap- 
peared at the bar as a constituted pres- 
bytery, and, ha\'ing formerly declined 
the assembly's authority, they imme- 
diately withdrew. The assembly which 
met next year, deposed them from the 
office of the ministry ; which, however, 
they continued to exercise in their re- 
spective congregations, who still ad- 
hered to them, and erected meeting- 
houses, where they preached till their 
death. Mr. James Fisher, the last sur- 
vivor of them, was by a unanimous 
call in 1741, translated from Kinclaven 
to Glasgow, where he continued in the 
exercise of his ministry among a nu- 
merous congregation, respected by all 
i-anks in that large city, ar*l died in 
1775, much regretted by his people and 
friends. In 1745, the seceding minis- 
ters were become so numerous, that they 
were erected into three diffi2rent pres- 
byteries under one synod, when a very 
unprofitable dispute divided them into 
two parties. 

The burgess oath, in some of the royal 
boroughs of Scotland, contains the fol- 
lowing clause : "I profess and allow with 
my heart the time religion presently pro- 
fessed witliin this realm, and authorised 
by the laws thereof. I will abide at and 
defend the same to my life's end, re- 
nouncing the Romish religion called 
PafiLitnj." Messrs. Ebenezer and Ralph 
Erskine, James Fisher, and others, af- 
firmed that this clause was no way con- 
trary to the principles upon which the 
secession was formed, and that there- 
fore eveiy seceder might lawfully swear 
it. Messrs. Alexander Moncrief, Tho- 
mas Mair, Adam Gib, and others, con- 
tended, on the other hand, that the 
swearing of the above clause was a vir- 



SEC 



553 



SEC 



tual renunciation of their testimony ; 
and this controversy was so keenly agi- i 
tated, that they split into two different 
parties, and now meet in different sy- 
nods. Xhose of them who assert the 
lawfulness of swearing the burgess oath 
are called Burghers; and the other 

?arty, who condemn it, are called Anti- 
urgher Seceders. Each party claiming 
to itself the lawful constitution of the 
Associate Synod, the Antiburghers, af- 
ter several previous steps, excommuni- 
cated the Burghers, on the ground of 
their sin, and of their contumacy in it. 
This i-upture took place in 1*4", since 
which period no attempts to effect a re- 
union have been successful. Tliey re- 
main under the jurisdiction of different 
synods, and hold separate communion, 
although much of their former hostility 
has been laid aside. The Antiburghers 
consider the Burghers as too lax, and 
not sufficiently steadfast to their testi- 
mony. The Burghers, on the other 
hand, contend that the Antiburghers are 
too rigid, in that they have introduced 
new terms of communion into the society. 
What follows in this article is a far- 
ther account of those who are common- 
ly called the Burgher Seceders. As 
there were among them, from the com- 
mencement of their secessions, several 
students who had been educated at one 
or other of the universities, they ap- 
pointed one of their ministers to give 
lectures in theology, and train up can- 
didates for the ministry. 

Whei'e a congregation is very nu- 
merous, as in Stirling, Dunfermline, and 
Perth, it is formed into a collegiate 
charge, and provided with two minis- 
ters. They are erected into six differ- 
ent presbyteries, united in one general 
synod, which commonly meets at Edin- 
burgh m May and September. They 
have also a synod in Ireland, composed 
of three or four different presbyteries. 
They are legally tolerated in Ireland ; 
and government, some yearsago, grant- 
ed 500/. per annnin, and of late an addi- 
tional 500/. which, when divided among 
them, affords to each minister about 
20/. over and above the stipend which he 
receives from his hearers. These have, 
besides, a pi'esbyteiy in Nova Scotia ; 
and, some years ago, it is said, that the 
Burgher and the Antiburgher ministers 
residing in the United States formed a 
coalition, and joined in a general synod, 
which they call the Syyiod of A''ew-York 
and Pennsylvania. They all preach the 
doctrines contained in the Westminster 
Confession of Faith, and Catechisms, as 
they believe these to be founded on the 
sacred Scriptui-es. They catechise their 



hearers public! v, and visit them from 
house to house once every year. They 
will not give the Lord's supper to those 
who are ignorant of the principles of 
the Gospel, nor to sucli as are scanda- 
lous and immoral in their lives. They 
condemn private baptism ; nor will they 
admit those who are grossly ignorant 
and profane to be sponsors for their 
children. Believing that the people have 
a natural right to choose their o%vn pas- 
tors, the settlement of their ministers 
always proceeds upon a popular elec- 
tion ; and the candidate, who is elected 
by the majority, is ordained among 
them. Convinced that the charge o? 
souls is a trust of the greatest impor- 
tance, they carefully watch over the mo- 
rals of their students, and direct them 
to such a course of reading and study 
as they judge most proper to qualify 
them for the profitable discharge of the 
pastoral duties. At the ordination of 
their ministers, they use a formula of 
the same kind with that of the esta- 
blished chui'ch, which their ministers 
are bound to subscribe when called to 
it ; and if any of tliem teach doctrines 
contrary to the Scriptures, or the West- 
minster Confession of Faith, they are 
sure of being thrown out of their com- 
munion. By this means, uniformity of 
sentiment is preserved among them; 
nor has any of their ministers, except- 
ing one, been prosecuted for error in 
doctrine since the commencement of 
their secession. 

They believe that the holy Scrip- 
tures are the sole criterion of truth, and 
the only rule to direct mankind to glori- 
fy and enjoy God, the chief and eternal 
good ; and that " the supreme Judge, 
by which all controversies of religion 
are to be determined, and all the de- 
crees of councils, opinions of ancient 
writers, doctrines of men and private 
spirits, are to be examined, and in 
whose sentence we are to rest, can be 
no other but the Holy Spirit speaking 
in the Scriptures." They are fully 
persuaded, howe\er, that the standards 
of public authority in the church of 
Scotland exhibit a just and consistent 
view of the meaning and design of the 
holy Scriptures with regard to doctrine, 
worship, government, and discipline; 
and they so far differ from the dissen- 
ters in England, in that they hold these 
standards to be not only articles of 
peace and a test of orthodoxy, but as a 
bond of union and fellowship. They 
consider a simple declaration of ad- 
herence to the Scriptures as too ec[ui- 
vocal a, proof of unity in sentiiULiit, 
! because Arians, Socinians, and ArmW

nians, make such a confession of their 
faith, while they retain sentiments wiiich 
they (the Seceders) apprehend are sub- 
versive of the great doctrines of the 
Gospel. They believe that Jesus Christ 
is the only King and Head of tlie church, 
which is his body ; that it is his sole pre- 
rogative to enact laws for the govern- 
ment of his kingdom, which is not of 
this world ; and that the church is not 
possessed of a legislative, but only of an 
executive power, to be exercised in ex- 
plaining and applying to their proper 
objects and end those laws which Christ 
hath published in the Scriptures. Those 
doctrmes which they teach relative to 
faith and practice are exhibited at great 
length in an Explanation of the West- 
minster Assembly's Shorter Catechism, 
by way of question and answer, in two 
volume^, composed chiefly by Mr. James 
Fisher, late of Glasgow, and published 
by desire of their synod. 

For these fifty years past, the grounds 
of their secession, they allege, have been 
greatly enlarged by the public adminis- 
trations of the established church, and 
particularly by the uniform executit^n 
of the law respecting pati-onagc, which, 
they say, has obliged many thousands 
of private Christians to withdraw from 
the parish churches, and join their so- 
ciety. 

In most of their congregations, they 
celebrate the Lord's supper twice in 
the year ; and they catechise their 
young people concerning their know- 
ledge of the principles of religion pre- 
viously to then' admission to that sacra- 
ment. — When any of them fall into the 
sin of fornication or adultery, the scan- 
dal is regularly purged according to 
the form of process in the established 
church ; and those of the delinquents 
who do not submit to adequate censure 
are publicly declared to be fugitives 
from discipline, and are expelled the 
society. They never accept a sum of 
money as a commutation for the offence. 
They condemn all clandestine and irre- 
gular marriages ; nor will they marry 
any persons unless they have been pro- 
claimed in the parish church oh two 
different Lord's days at least. 

The constitution of the Antiburgher 
church differs very little from that of 
the Burghers. 'Fhe supi-eme court 
among them is designated The General 
Associate Synod, having under its juris- 
diction three provhicial synods in Scot- 
land and one in Ireland. They, as well 
as the Burgher Seceders, have a pro- 
fessor of theology, whose lectures every 
candidate for the office of a preacher is 
obliged to attend. 



SECT, a collective temn, compre- 
hending all such as follow the doctrines 
and opinions of some divine, philosopher, 
&amp;c. The word sect, says Dr. Camp- 
bell, (Prelim. Diss.) among tl\e Jews, 
was not in its application entirely coin- 
cident with the same term as applied 
by Christians to the subdivisions sub- 
sisting among themselves. We, if I 
mistake not, invariably use it of those 
who form separate communions, and do 
not associate with one another in reli- 
gious worship and ceremonies. Thus, 
we call Papists, Lutherans, Calvinists, 
different* sects, not so much on account 
of their differences in opinion, as be- 
cause they have established to them- 
selves different fraternities, to which, in 
what regards public worship, they con- 
fine themselves ; tlie several denomina- 
tions above-mentioned having no inter- 
community with one anotiier in sacred 
matters. High church and low church 
we call only parties, because they have 
not formed separate communions. Great 
and known differences in opinion, when 
followed by no external Ijreach in the 
society, are not considei'cd with us as 
constituting distinct sects, though their 
differences in opinion may give rise to 
mutual aversion. Now, in the Jewish 
sects (if we except the Samaritans,) 
there were no separate comnmnities 
erected. The same temple, and the 
same synagogues, were attended alike 
by Pharisees smd by Sadducees: nay, 
thci-e were often of both denominations 
in the Sanhedrim, and even in the priest- 
hood. — Another difference was also, 
that the name of the .sect was not ap- 
plied to all the people who adopted the 
same opinions, but solely to the men of 
eminence among them who were con- 
sidered as the leaders of the paity. 

SECULAR CLERGY. See Cler-

SECUNDIANS, a denomination in 
the second century which derived tlieir 
name from Secundus, a disciple of Va- 
lentine. He maintained the doctrine of 
two eternal principles, viz. light and 
darkness, whence ai'ose the good and 
evil that are observable in the universe. 
See Valentinians. 

SEDUCER, one who decoys or draws 
awav another from that which is right. 

SEEKERS, a denomination which 
arose in the year 1645. They derived 
their name from their maintaining that 
the ti'ue church ministry, Scripture, 
and ordinances, were lost, for which they 
were seeking. They taught that the 
Scriptures were uncertain; that present 
miracles were necessary to faith ; that 
our ministry is without Authority ; and

that our worship and oi'dinances are 
unneccssaiy f^i' vain. 
• SELEUCIANS, disciples of Seleu- 
cus, a philosopher of Galatia, who, about 
tl\e year 380, adopted the sentiments of 
Hermogcnes and those of Audxus. He 
tauijht, with the Valentinians, that Je- 
sus Christ assumed a body only in ap- 
pearance. He also maintained that the 
world was not made by God, but was 
co-eternal with him ; and tliat the soul 
was only an animated lire created by 
the angels ; -that Christ does not sit at 
the right hand of the Father in a hu- 
man body, but that he lodged his body 
in the sun, according to Ps. xix. 4; and 
that the pleasures of beatitude consisted 
in corporeal delight. 

SELF-DECEPTION, includes all 
those various frauds which we practise 
on ourselves in forming a' judgment, or 
receiving an impression of our state, 
character, and conduct ; or those de- 
ceits which make our liearts impose on 
us in making us promises, if they may 
be so termed, which are not kept, and 
contracting engagements wliich are ne- 
ver performed. Sclf-doce]jtion, as one 
observes, appears in the following cases: 
" 1. In judging of our own character, on 
wliich we too easily confer the name of 
self-examination, how often may we de- 
tect ourselves in enhancing the merit of 
the good qualities we possess, and in 
giving ourselves credit for others, which 
we really have not. — 2. Wlien se\'eral 
motives or passions concur in prompting 
us to any action, we too easily assign the 
chief place and effect to the best. — 3. 
We are too prone to flatter ourselves 
by indulging the notion that our habits 
of vice are but individual acts, into 
which we have been seduced by occa- 
sional temptation?, wliile we are easily 
led to assign the name of habits to our 
occasional acts and individual instances 
of virtue. — 4. We confound the mei'e 
assent of the. understanding naturally, 
attended by some correspondent but 
transient sensibilities, with the impulses 
of the affections and determination of the 
■will. — 5. We are apt to ascribe to set- 
tled principles the good actions, which 
are the mere effect of natural temper. — 
6. As sometimes, in estimating the cha- 
racter of others, we too hastily infer the 
right motive from the outward act ; so 
in judging of ourselves we over-rate the 
worth, by over-valuing the motives of 
our actions. — 7. We often confound the 
non-appearance of a vicious affection 
with its actual extinction. — 8. We often 
deceive ourselves by comparing our ac- 
tual with our former character and con- 
duct, and perhaj^s too easily ascribing 



to the extirpation of vicious, or the im- 
plantation of virtuous habits, that im- 
jjrovemcnt which is owing merely to the 
lapse of time, advancing age, altered 
circumstances, &amp;c. — 9. Another gene- 
ral and fertile source of self-deception 
is our readiness to excuse, or at least to 
extenuate, the vices of our particular 
station: while we congratulate ourselves 
on the aljsence of other vices which we 
are under no temptation to commit. — 

10. We deceive ourselves by supposing 
our remorse for sin is genuine, when, 
alas, it does not lead to repentance. — &gt; 

11. By forming improper judgments of 
others, and forming our own conduct 
upon theirs." From this view we may 
learn, 1. That the objects as to which 
men deceive themselves are very nu- 
merous ; God, Jesus Christ, the holy- 
Spirit, the Bible and Gospel doctrines, 
religious experience, sin, heaven, hell, 
&amp;c. — 2. The causes are great and pow- 
erful ; sin, Satan, the heart, the woi'ld, 
interest, prejudice. — 3. The numbers 
who deceive themselves are great; the 
young, the aged, the rich, the poor, self- 
righteous, hypocrites, apostates, the un- 
godly. — 4. The evils are many and aw- 
fiil. It renders us the slaves of procras- 
tination, leads us to over-rate ourselves, 
flatters us with an idea of easy victory, 
confirms our evil habits, and exposes us 
to the greatest danger. — 5. We should 
endeavour to understand and practise 
the means not to be deceived ; such as 

-strict self-inquiry, prayer, watchful- 
ness, and ever taking the Scriptures foi 
our guide. — 6. And lastly, we should 
learn to ascertain the evidence of not 
being deceived, which are such as these: 
when sin is the oljject of our increasing 
fear, a tenderness oi" conscience, when 
we can appeal to God as to the sincerity 
of our motives and aims, when depen- 
dent on God's promise, proxidence, and 
grace, and when conformed to him in all 
righteousness and ti'ue holiness. Chi-ist.

hazarding the life of the assailant ; and 
©there again, who deny it not to be law- 
ful in some cases to kill the aggressor, 
at the same time affirm it to be a 
thing more laudable and consonant to 
the Gospel, to choose rather to lose 
one's life, in imitation of Christ, than 
to secure it at the expense of another's, 
in pui'suance of the permission of na- 
ture. But, 

" Notwithstanding," says Grove, "the 
great names which may appear on the 
side of any of these opinions, I cannot 
but think self-defence, thoufirh it pro- 
ceeds to the Killing of another to save 
one's self, is in common cases not barely 
permitted, but enjoined by 7iature; and 
that a man would be wanting to the jiu- 
thor of his being, to society, and to him- 
sef to abandon that life with which he 
is put in ti-ust. Thut a person forfeits 
his own life to the sword of justice, bv 
taking away another's unprovoked, is a 
principle not to be disputed. This l)e- 
ing so, I ask, whence should ai'ise the 
obligation to let another kill me, rather 
than venture to save myself by destroy- 
ing my enemy ? It cannot arise from a 
regard to society, which, by my suffering 
another to kill me, loses two lives ; that 
of an honest man by unjust violence, and 
that of his murderer, if it can be called 
a loss, by the hand of justice. Whereas, 
by killing the invader of my life, I only 
take a lite, which must otheT'wise have 
been forfeited, and preserve the life of 
an innocent ]&gt;erson. Nor, for the same 
reason, can there be any such obligation 
arising from the love of our neighbour; 
since I do not really save his life by 
parting with my own, but only leave 
him to be put to death after a more ig- 
riominious manner tfV the public execu- 
tioner. And if it be said that I dispatch 
him with his sins upon him into the 
otlier world, which he might have lived 
long enough to repent of, if legally con- 
demned ; as he must answer for that, 
who brought me under a necessity of 
using this method for my own pi-eserva- 
tion; so I myself may not be prepared, 
or may not think myself so, or so well 
assured of it as to \'enture into the pre- 
sence of my great Judge ; and no cha- 
rity obliges me to prefer the safetv of 
another's soul to my own. Self-defence, 
therefore, may be with justice practised, 
S. In case of an attempt made upon the 
life of a person, against which he has no 
other way of securing himself but repel- 
ling force by force. — 2. It is generally 
esteemed lawful to kill in the defence 
of chastity, supposing there be no other 
way of preserving it." See G?-o-rr's 
Moral Philosophy. Also Hints on the 



jMivfulness of Self-defence, by a Scotch 
Dissenter. 

SELF-DENIAL, a term that de- 
notes our relinquishing every thing that 
stands in opposition to the divine com- 
mand, and our own spiritual welfare, 
Matthew, xvi. 24. It does not consist in 
denying what a man is, or what he has : 
in refusing favouis conferred on us in 
the course of providence ; in rejecting 
the use of God's creatures ; in being 
careless of life, health, and family; in 
macerating the body, or abusing it in 
any respect;. but in renouncing all those 
pleasures, profits, views, connections, or 
practices, that . are prejudicial to the 
true interests of the soul. The under- 
standing must be so far denied as not to 
lean upon it, independent of divine in- 
struction, Prov. iii. 5, 6. The will must 
be denied, so far as it opposes the will 
of God, Eph. V. 17. The affections, 
when they become inordinate, Col. iii. 
,5. The gratification of the membere of 
the body must be denied when out of 
their due course, Uom. vi. 12, 13. The 
honours of the world, and praise of men, 
when they become a snare, Heb. xi. 24. 
— 26. Worldly emoluments, when to be 
ol^taincd in an unlawful way, or when 
standing in opposition to religion and 
usefulness. Matt. iv. 20—22. Fi-iends 
and relatives, so far as they oppose the 
truth, and would influence us to oppose 
it too. Gen. xii. 1. Our own righteous- 
ness, so as to depend upon it, Phil. iii. 8, 
9. Life itself must be laid down, if call- 
' ed for, in the cause of Christ, Matt. xvi. 
i 24, 25. In fine, every thing that is sin- 
I ful must be denied, however pleasant, 
I and apparently advantageous, since, 
I without holiness, no man shall see the 
Lord, Heb. xii. 14. To enable us- to 
practise this duty, let. us consider the 
I injunction of Christ, Matt. xvi. 24 ; his 
eminent example, Phil. ii. 5, 8 ; the en- 
couragem,ent he gives. Matt. xvi. 25 ; 
the example of his saints in all ages ; 
Heb. xi. ; the advantages that attend it, 
and, above all, learn to implore the agen- 
cy of that Divine Spirit, without whom 
we can do nothing. 

SELF-EXAMINATION, is the call- 
ing ourselves to a strict account for all 
tlie actions of our lives, comparing them 
with the word of God, the rule of duty; 
considering how much evil we have 
committed, and good we have omitted. 
It is a duty founded on a divine com- 
jnand, 2 Cor. xiii. 5. and ought to be, 1. 
Deliberately. — 2. Frequently. — 3. Im- 
partially. — ^4-. Diligently. — 5.' Wisely. — 
And, 6. With a desire of amendment.

dern Christians would call it, is essential

In the voyage of life, also, the Christian 
who would not make shipwreck of his

SELF-KNOWLEDGE, the know- 
ledge of one's own character, abilities,

secret springs of action, thoughts, me-

vices. This knowledge is commanded 
in the Scriptures, Psalm iv. 4. 2 Cor. 
xiii. 5. and is of the greatest utility, as 
it is the spring of self-possession, leads 
to humility, steadfastness, charity, mo- 
deration, self-denial, and promotes- our 
usefulness in the world. To obtain it, 
there should be watchfulness, frequent 
and close attention to the operations of 
our own minds, regard had to the opi- 
nions of others, con\'ersation, reading 
the Scriptures, and dependence on di- 
vine grace. See Mason on Self-know- 
ledge ; Baxter's Self-Acquamtance ;

pro-vement of the Mind; 

SELF-L0\^E is that instinctive prin- 
ciple which impels every animal, ra- 
tional and irrational, to preserve its life 
and promote its own happiness. " It is 
very generally confounded with selfish- 
ness ; but, perhaps, the one propensity 
is distinct from the other. Every man 
loves himself, but every man is not 
selfish. The selfish man grasps at all 
immediate advantages, regardless of 
the consequences which his conduct 
may have upon his neighbour. Self- 
love only prompts him who is actuated 
by it to procure to himself the greatest 
possible sum of happiness during the 
whole of his existence. In this pursuit, 
the rational self-lover will often forego 
a present enjoyment to obtain a greater 



and more permanent one in reversion ; 

and he will as often submit to a present 
pain to avoid a greater hereafter. Self- 
love, as distinguished from selfishness,- 
alwavs comprehends the whole of u 
man's existence ; and, in that extended 
sense of the phrase, eveiy man is a self- 
lover ; for, with eternity in his view, it 
is surely not possible for the most disin- 
terested of the human race not to pre- 
fer himself to all other men, if their fu- 
ture and everlasting interests could 
come into competition. This, indeed^ 
they never can do ; for though the in- 
troduction of evil into the world, and the 
different ranks whicli it makes neces- 
saiy in society, put it in the power of 
a man to raise himself in the present 
state by the depression of his neigh- 
bour, or by the practice of injustice ; 
yet, in the pursuit of the glorious prize 
which is set before us, there can be no 
rivalship among the competitors. The 
success of one is no injury to another ; 
and therefore, in this sense of the 
phrase, self-love is not only lawful, but 
absolutely unavoidable." Self-love, how- 
ever, says Jortin (sei*. 13, vol. iv.) is vi- 
cious, 1. When it leads us to judge too 
favourably of our faults. — 2. When we 
think too well of our righteousness, and 
over-value our good actions, and are 
pure in our own eyes. — 3. When we 
over-value our abilities, and entertain 
too good an ojjinion of our knowledge and 
capacity. — 4. When we are proud and 
vain of inferior things, and value our- 
selves upon the station and circum- 
stances in which, not our own deserts, 
but some other cause, has placed us. — 
5. When we make our worldly interest, 
convenience, ease or pleasure, the great 
end of our actions. 

Much has been said about the doctrine 
of disinterested love to God. It must 
be confessed, that we ought to love him 
for his own excellences ; yet it is diffi- 
cult to form an idea how we can love 
God unconnected with any interest to 
ourselves. What, indeed, we ought to 
do, and what we really do, or can do, is 
very different. There is an everlasting 
obligation on men to love God for what 
hs is, however incapable of doing it ; but, 
at the same time, our love to him is our 
interest; nor can we, in the present 
state, I think, while possessed of such 
bodies and such minds, love God with- 
out including a sense of his relative 
goodness. "We love him," says John, 
" because he first loved us." Sec Love.

Self-seeking evidences itself by parsimo- 
niousness, oppression, neglect,- and con- 
tempt of otl\ers, reljellion, sedition,

SEMBIANI, so called from Sembia- 
nus their leader, who condemned all 
use of wine as evil of itself. He per- 
suaded his followers that wine was a 
production of Satan and the earth, de- 
nied the resurrection of the body, and 
{■ejected most of the books of the Old 
Testament. 

SEMI-ARIANS, were thus denomi- 
nated, because, in jirofession, they con- 
demned the errors of the Arians, but in 
reality maintained their principles, only 
palliating and concealing them under 
softer and more moderate terms. They 
would not allow, with the orthodox, that 
the Son was oiOBcriot, of the same sub- 
stance, but only o/jimbo-ios, of a like sub- 
.starice with the Father; and thus, 
though in expression they differed from 
the orthodox in a single letter only, yet 
in effect they denied the divinitv of 
Jesus Christ. The Semi-arianism of the 
moderns consists in their maintaining 
that the Son was, from all eternity, be- 
gotten by the nvill of the Father ; con- 
trary to the doctrine of those who teach 
that, the eternal generation is iieces- 
sary. Such, at least, are the respec- 
tive opinions of Dr. Clarke and Bishop 
Bnll. 



SEI'/Il-PELAGIANS, a name an- 
ciently, and even at this day, given to 
such as retain some tincture of Pela- 
gianism. 

Cassian, who had been a deacon of 
Constantinople, who was afterwards a 
priest .at Marseilles, was the chief of 
these Semi-Pelagians, whose leading 
principles were, 1. That God did not dis- 
pense his grace to one more than ano- 
ther, in consequence of predestination, 
i. e, an eternal and absolute decree, but 
was willing to save all men, if they com- 
plied with the terms of his Gospel. — 2. 
That Christ died for all men.— 3. That 
the grace purchased by Christ, and ne- 
cessary to salvation, was offered to all 
men. — 4. That man, before he received 
grace, was capable of faith and holy de- 
sires. — 5. That man was born fi-ee, and 
was, consequentlv, capable of resisting 
the influences of grace, or of complying 
with its suggestion. — 6. The Semi-Pela- 
gians were very numerous ; and the 
doctrine of Cassian, though variously ex- 
]jlained,' was received in the greatest 
part of the monastic schools in Gaul, 
from whence it spread itself far and 
wide throngh the Euro])ean provinces. 
As to the Greeks, and other Eastern 
Christians, they had embraced the Se- 
mi-Pelagian doctrines before Cassian. 
In the sixth centurv the controversy be- 
tween the Semi-Pelagians and the dis- 
ciples of Augustin prevailed much, 
and continued to divide the Western 
churches. 

SENSATION properly signifies that 
internal act by which we are made 
conscious of pleasui'e or pain felt at the 
organ of sense. As to sensations and 
feelings, says Dr. Reid, some belong to 
the animal part of our nature, and are 
common to us with the brutes; others 
belong to the rational and moral part. 
The first are more properlv called sen- 
sations; the X-Ast, feelings. The French 
word sentiment is common to both. The 
design of thv Almighty in giving us both 
the painful and agreeable feelings is, 
for tiie most jjart, obvious, and well de- 
serving our notice. 1. The painful sen- 
sations are admonitions to avoid what 
would huvt us ; and the agreeable sen- 
sations to invite us to those actions that 
are necessary to the preservation of the 
individual or the kind. — 2. By the same 
means, nature invites us to moderate 
bodily exercise, and admonishes us to 
avoid idleness and inactivity on the one 
hand, and excessive labour on the other. 
— 3. The moderate exercise of all our 
rational powers gives pleasure. — 4. 
Every species of beauty is oeheld with 
pleasure, and every species of deformity

with disgust. — 5. The benevolent af- 
fections are all accompanied with an 
agreeable feeling ; the malevolent on 
the contrary; and, — 6. The highest, 
the noblest, "and the most durable plea- 
sure is that of doing well ; and the most 
bitter and painful sentiment, the anguisli 
and remorse of a guilty conscience. See

Kaiins's Elements of Criticism, vol. ii.

SENSE, a fticulty of the soul, where- 
by it perceives external objects by 
means of impressions made on the or- 
gans of the bodv. 

Moral Sense is said to be an appre- 
hension of that beauty or defoi-mity 
which arises in the mind by a kind of 
natural instinct, previously to any rea- 
soning upon' the remoter consequences 
of actions. Whether this really exists 
or not, is disputed. On the affirmative 
side it is said, that, 1. We approve or 
disapprove certain actions without de- 
liberation. — 2. This approbation or dis- 
approbation is uniform and universal. 
But against this opinion it is answered, 
that, 1. This uniformity of sentiment 
does not pervade all nations. — 2. Appro- 
bation of particular conduct ai-ises from 
a sense of its advantages. The idea 
continues when the motive no longer 
exists ; receives strength from au- 
thority, imitation. Sec. The efficacy of 
imitation is most observable in children. 
— 3. There are no maxims universally 
true, but bend to circumstances. — 4-. 
There can be no idea without an object, 
and instinct is inseparable from the idea 
of the object. See Paley^s Moral Phi- 
losofihy, vol. 1. chap. v. ; Hutcheson on 
the Passions, p. 245, &amp;c. ; Alason's Ser- 
mons, vol. i. p. 253. 

SEPTUAGINT, the nanie given to 
a Greek version of the books of the 
Old Testament, from its being sup- 
posed to be the work of seventy-two 
Je\vs, who are usually called the seventy 
interpi'eters, because seventy is a round 
number. 

Aristobulus, who was a tutor to Ptole- 
my Physcon ; Philo, who lived in our 
Saviour's time, and was contempoi-ary 
with the apostles ; and Josephus, speak 
of this translation as made by seventy- ' 
two interpreters, by the care of Deme- 1 
trius Phalereus, in the reign of Ptolemy 
Philadelphus. All the Christian writers, 
during the first fifteen centuries of the 
Christian sera, have admitted this ac- 
count of the Septuagint as an undoubted 
fact ; but, since the reformation, critics 
have boldly called it in question. But 
whatever differences of opinions there 



have been as to the mode of translation, 
it is universally acknowledged that such 
a version, whole or in part, existed; 
and it is pretty evident that most of the 
books must have been translated before 
oui; Saviour's time, as they are quoted 
bv him. It must also be considered as 
a woiiilerful providence in favour of the 
religion of Jesus. It prepared the way 
for his coming, and afterwards greatly 
promoted the setting up of his kingdom 
in the world ; for hitherto the Scrip- 
tures had remained locked up from all 
other nations but the Jews, in the He- 
Iirew tongue, whicli was understood by 
no other nation ; but now it was trans- 
lated into the (ireek language, which 
was a language commonly understood 
by the nations of the world. It has also 
been with great propriety observed, 
" that there are many words and forms 
of speech in the New Testament, the 
true import of which cannot be known 
but by tlieir use in the Septuagint. This 
version also preserves many important 
ivords, some sentences, and several 
nvhole verses which originally made a 
part of tlie Hebrew text, but have long 
ago entirely disappeared. This is the 
version, and this only, which is con- 
stantlv used and quoted in the Gospels 
and by the apostles, and which has 
thereby received ti\e highest sanction 
which any writings can possibly re- 
ceive." 

There have been various editions of 
the Septuagint ; such as Breitenger's 
edition, 1730; Boss's edition, 1709; 
Daniel's edition, 1653 ; Mill's edition, 
12mo. 1725 ; bishop Pearson's, printed 
by Field, 12mo. 1665 ; but Grabe's edi- 
tion, published in 1707, is in great re- 
pute. 

Dr. Holmes, canon of Christ Church, 
was. employed for some years on a cor- 
rect edition of the Septuagint. He had 
been collating from more than three 
hundred Greek manuscripts ; from 
twenty or more Coptic, Syriac, Arabic, 
Sclavonian, and Arn)enian manuscripts; 
from eleven editions of the Greek text 
and versions ; and from near thirty 
Cireek fatliers, when death prevented 
him from finisliing this valualjle work. 
He printed tlie whole of the Pentateuch 
in five parts folio ; and lately edited the 
prophecy of Daniel according to Theo- 
dotian and the LXX., departing from 
his proposed order, as if by a presenti- 
ment of his end. This valuable work is 
now continued by Mr. Parsons, of Cam- 
bridge.

septuagiKt chronology, 

the chronology which is formed frem 
the dates and periods of time mentioned 
in the Septuagint translation of the ( Hd 
Testament. It reckons 1500 years more 
from the creation to Abraliam than the 
Hebrew Bible. Dr. Kennicott, in the 
dissertation prefixed to his Hebrew Bi- 
ble, has shown it to be verv probable 
that the chronology of the Hebrew 
Scriptures, since the period just men- 
tioned, was coriTjpted by the Jews hr- 
tween the years 175 and 200 ; and that 
the chronology of the Septuagint is more 
agreeable to truth. It is a fact, that 
during tlie second and third centuries, 
the Hebrew Scriptures were almost en- 
tirely in the hands of the Jews, while 
the Septuagint was confined to the Cliris- 
tians. Tlie Jews had, therefore, a very 
favourable opportunity for this corrup- 
tion. The following is the reason 
■which is given by Oriental writers ; It 
being a very ancient tradition that Mes- 
siah was to come in the sixth chiliad, 
because he was to come in the last days, 
(founded on a mystical application of 
the six days creation,) the contrivance 
was to shorten the age of the world 
from about 5500 to 3760 ; and thence to 
prove that Jesus could not be the Mes- 
siah. Dr. Kennicott adds, that some 
Hebrew copies, having the larger chro- 
nology, were extant till the time of Eu- 
sebius, and some till the year 700. 

SERIOUSNESS, a term often used 
as synonymous with religion. 

SERMON, a discourse delivered in 
public for the purpose of religious in- 
struction and improvement. 

In order to make a good sermon, the 
following things may be attended to. 
The exordium should correspond with 
the subject on which we are aljout to 
ti'eat. For this purpose the context of- 
ten forms a source of appropriate re- 
mark ; and this, though called a hack- 
neyed way, is one of the best for open- 
ing gradually to the subject ; though, I 
confess, always to use it is not so well, 
as it looks formal. There are some 
subjects in which the context cannot be 
consulted: then, perhaps, it is best to 
begin with some passage of Scripture 
apposite to the subject, or some striking 
observation. It has been debated, in- 



deed, whether we should begin with 
any thing particularly calculated to gain 
the attention, or whether we should 
rise gradually in the strength of remark 
and aptness of sentiment. As to this, 
we may observe, that, although it is ac- 
knowledged that a minister should flame 
most towards the end, perhaps it would 
be well to guard against a too low and 
feeble manner in the exordium. It has 
been frequently the practice of making 
apologies, by way of introduction : 
though this may be admitted in some 
singular cases, as on the sudden death 
of a minister, or disappointment of the 
preacher through unforeseen circum- 
stances ; yet I think it is often made 
use of where it is entirely unnecessary, 
and carries with it an air of affectation 
and pride. An apology for a man's self 
is often more a reflection than any thing 
else. If he be not qualified, why have 
the eflfrnntery to engage ? and, if quali- 
fied, wliy tell the people an untruth ? 

Jixordiums should be short: some 
give us an abridgment of their sermon in 
their introduction, which takes off" the 
people's attention afterwards ; others 
promise so much, that the expectation 
thei'eby raised is often disappointed. 
EVoth these should be avoided ; and a 
simple, correct, modest, deliberate, easy 
gradation to the text attended to. 

Js to the plan. Sometimes a text 
may be discussed by exposition and in- 
ference ; sometimes by raising a propo- 
sition, as the general sentiment of the 
text, from which several truths may be 
deduced and insisted on ; sometimes by 
general observations ; and sometimes 
by division. If we discuss by exposition, 
then we should examine the authenti- 
city of the reading, the accuracy of the 
translation, and the scope of the writer. 
If a proposition be raised, care should 
be taken that it is founded on the mean- 
ing of the text. If observations be made, 
they should not be too numerous, fo- 
reign, nor upon every particle in the 
text. If by division, the heads should 
be distinct and few, yet have a just de- 
pendence on and connection one with 
the other. It was common in the last 
two centuries to have such a multitude 
of heads, subdivisions, observations, and 
inferences, that hardly any one could 
remember them : it is the custom of the 
present day, among many, to run into 
the other extreme, and to have no di- 
vision at all. This is equally as inju- 
rious. " I have no notion," says one, 
"of the great usefulness of a sermon 
without heads and divisions. They 
should be few and distinct, and not co- 
incide But a general harangue, or a

ctTtion with a concealed division, is 
very improper for the generality of 
hearers, especially the common people, 
as they can neither remember it, nor so 
well understand it." Another observes : 
"We should ever remember that we 
are speaking to the plainest capacities ; 
and as the arranging our ideas properly 
is necessary to our being understood, so 
the giving each division of our discourse 
its denomination of number, has a happy 
efFett to assist the attention and memory 
of our hearers." 

As to the amplijication. After having 
laid a good foundation on which to build, 
the superstructure should be raised with 
care. "Let every text have its true 
meaning, every truth its due weight, 
every hearer his proper poi-tion." The 
reasoning should be cleai% deliberate, 
and strong. No flights of wit should be 
indulged; but a close attention to the 
subject, with every exertion to inform 
the judgment and impress the heart. It 
is in this part of a semion that it will be 
seen whether a man understands his 
subject, enters into the spirit of it, or 
whethei', after all his parade, he be a 
mere trifler. I have known some, who, 
after having giving a pleasing exordium 
and ingenious plan, have been veiy de- 
ficient m the amplification of the sub- 
ject ; which shows that a man may be 
capable of making a good plan, and not 
a good sermon, which, of the two, per- 
tiaps, is worse than making a good ser- 
mon without a good plan. The best of 
men, however, cannot always enter in- 
to the subject with that ability which at 
certain times they are capable of. If in 
our attempts, therefore, to enlarge on 
pai'ticulars, v/e find our thoughts do not 
i-un freely on any point, we should not 
iirge them too much — this will tire and 
jade the faculties too soon ; but pursue 
our plan. Better thoughts may occur 
afterwards, which we may occasionally 
insert. 

As to the application. It is much to 
be lamented that this is a pai't which 
does not belong to the sermons of some 
divines. They can discuss a topic in a 
general way, show their abilities, and 
give pleasing descriptions of virtue and 
religion ; but to apply, they think will 
hurt the feelings of their auditors. But 
I believe it has been found that, among 
such, little good has been done ; nor is 
it likely, when the people are never 
led to suppose that they are the parties 
interested. There are also some doc- 
trinal preachers who reject application 
altogether, and who affect to discharge 
their office by narrating and reasoning 
only : but such should remember that 



reasoning is persuasion ; and that them- 
selves, as often as any men, slide into 
personal application, especially in dis- 
cussing certain favourite points in divini- 
ty. Application is CQrtainly one of the 
most important parts of a sermon. Here 
both the judgment and tiie passions 
should be powerfully addressed. Here 
the minister must reason, expostulate, 
invite, warn, and exhort ; and all with- 
out harshness and an insulting air. Here 
pity, love,' faithfulness, concern, must 
be all displayed. The application, how- 
ever, must not be too long, unnatui'al, 
nor, I think, concluded abruptly. — We 
shall now subjoin a few remai'ks as to 
the style and delivery. 

As to style: it should be perspicuous. 
Singular terms, hard words, bombastic 
expressions, are not at all consistent. 
Quoting Latin and Greek sentences 
will be of little utility. Long argumen- 
tations, and dry metaphysical reasoning, 
should be avoided. A plain manly 
style, so clear that it cannot be misun- 
derstood, should be pursued. The 
Scriptures are the best model. Mr. 
Flavel sajs, " The devil is very busy 
with ministers in their studies, tempt- 
ing them to lofty language, and terms of 
art, above their hearers' capacities." 

The style should be correct. That a 
man may preach, and do good, without 
knowing much of grammar, is not to be 
doubted ; but certainly it cannot be 
pleasing to hear a man, who sets him- 
self up as a teacher of others, continually 
violating all the rules of grammar, anci 
rendering himself a laughing-stock to 
the more intelligent part of the congre- 
gation ; "and yet," says one, "I have 
heard persons, who could scarce utter 
three sentences without a false con- 
stiiiction, malce grammatical criticisms 
not only on the English language, but 
on Latin, Greek, and Hebrew." 

Care should always be taken not to 
use a redundancy of words, and a jingle 
of sentences and syllables, as they caiTy 
more an air of pedantiy than of pru- 
dence. 

As to the use ofjigures. " A noble me- 
taphor, when it is placed to advariltige, 
casts a kind of glory round it, and darts 
a lustre through a whole sentence." 
But the present and the past age have 
abounded with preachers, who have 
murdered and distorted figures in a. 
shameful manner. Reach's metaphors 
are nin beyond all due bounds. Yet I 
know of no method so useful in preach- 
uig as by figures, when well chosen, 
when they are not too mean, nor dra^vn 
out into too many parallels. The Scrip- 
tures abound with figures. Our Lord

and his disciples constantly used them ; 
and people understand a subject better 
when represented by a figure, than by 
learned disquisitions.

refer to the articles t)ECLAMATiON and 
Eloquence. See also Minister and 
Preaching. 

SERPENTINIANS, or Ophites, 
heretics in the second century, so called 
from the veneration they had for the 
serpent that tempted Eve, and the wor- 
ship paid to a real serpent : they pre- 
tended that the serpent was Jesus 
Christ, and that he taught men the 
knowledge of good and evil. They dis- 
tinguished between Jesus and Christ. 
Jesus, they said, was born of the Vir- 
gin, but Christ came down from heaven 
to be united with him : Jesus was cruci- 
fied, but Christ had left him to return 
to heaven. They distinguished the God 
of the Jews, whom they termed Jalda- 
haoth, from the supreme God : to the 
former they ascribed the body, to the 
latter the soul of men. It is said tliey 
had a live serpent, which they kept in a 
kind of cage : at certain times they 
opened the cage-door, and called the 
serpent : the animal came out, and, 
mounting upon the table, twined itself 
about some loaves of bread. This bread 
they bi'oke, and distributed it to the 
conipany; and this they called their 
Eucharist. 

SERVANTS. The business of ser- 
vants is to wait upon, minister to, sup- 
port and defend their masters ; but there 
are three cases, as Ur. Stennett observes, 
wherein a servant may be justified in re- 
fusing obedience : 1. When the master's 
commands are contrary to the will of 
God. — 2. When they are required to do 
what is not in their jwwer. — 3. When 
such service is demanded as falls not 
within the compass of the servant's 
agreement. The obligations servants 
are under to uni\ ersal obedience, are 
from these considerations : 1. That it is 
fit and right. — 2. That it is the expressed 
command of God. — 3. That it is for the 
interest both of body and soul. — 4. That 
it is a credit to our holy religion. Tlie 
manner in which this service is to be 
performed is, 1. With humility, Prov. 
XXX. 21, 22 ; Eccl. x. 7.-2. Fidelity, 
Titus ii. 10; Matt. xxiv. 45.-3. Dili- 
gence, Prov. X. 4. xxi. 5 ; 1 Thess. iv. 
11. — 4. Cheei-fulness. Stennett's Do- 
mestic Duties, ser. 7 ; Fleetwood's Re-

SERVITES, a religious order in the 
church of Rome, founded about the 
year 1233 by seven Florentine mer- 



chants, who, with the approbatidn of 
the bishop of Florence, renounced the 
world, and lived together in a religious 
community on Mount Senar,two leagues 
from thut'citv. 

SETHIAKS, heretics who paid di- 
vine worship to Seth, whom they looked 
upon to be Jesus Christ, the Son of God, 
but who was made by a third divinity, 
and substituted in the room of the twd 
families of Abel and Cain, which had 
been destroyed by the deluge. They ap- 
peared in Egypt in the second century ; 
and, as they were addicted to all sorts of 
debauchery, they did not want followers. 
They continued in Egypt abcfve two 
hundred years. 

SEVENTY. About the year B. C. 
277, the Old Testament was translated 
into Greek, by the united labours of 
about seventy learned Jews, and that 
translation has been since known by the 
version of the LXX. See Septuagint.

SEXAGESIMA, the second Sunday .

SHAKERS, a sect which was insti- 
tuted about the year 1774, in America. 
Anna Leese, whom they style the Elect 
Lady, is the head of tliis party. They 
assert that she is the woman spoken of 
in the 12th chap, of Revelations, and 
that she speaks seventy-two tongues; 
and though tliose tongues are unintelli- 
gible to the living, she converses with 
the dead, who understand her language. 
They add farther, that she is the mo- 
ther of all the elect, and that she tra- 
vails for the whole world ; that, in fine, 
no blessing can descend to any person 
but only by and through her, and that 
in the way of her being possessed of 
their sins by their confessing and re- 
penting of them, one by one; according 
to her direction. They vary in their 
exercises: their heavy dancing, as it is 
called, is performed by a perpetual 
springing from the house floor, about 
four incUes up and down, both in the 
men's and women's apartment, moving 
about with extraordinary transport, sing- 
ing sometimes one at a time, and some- 
times more. This elevation affects the 
nerves, so that they have intervals of 
shuddering, as if they were in a violent 
fit of the ague. They sometimes clap 
their hands, and leap so high as to strike 
the joists above their heads. They throw 
off their outside garment in these exer- 
cises, and spend their strength very 
cheerfully this way : their chief speak- 
er often calls for their attention, wlien 
they all stop and hear some harangue, 
and then begin dancing again. They as-

sert that tlieir dancing is the token of 
the great joy and happiness of the Jeru- 
salem state, and denotes the victory 
over sin. One of their most favourite 
exertions is turning round very swiftly 
for an hour, or two. This, they say, is 
to show the great power of Ciod. Such 
is the account which different writers 
have given us of this sect ; but others 
observ^e, that though, at first, they used 
these violent gesticulations, now they 
have " a regular, solemn, uniform dmice, 
or genuflection, to a regular, solemn 
hymn which is sung by the elders, and 
as regularly conducted as a proper band 
of music." See J^eio York Tlieol. Mag. 
for Nov. and Dec. 1795. 

SHAME, a painful sensation, occa- 
sioned by the quick apprehension that 
reputation and character are in danger, 
or h\ the perception that they are lost. 
It may arise, says Dr. Cogan, from the 
immediate detection, or the fear of de- 
tection, in something ignominious. It 
may also arise from native diffidence in- 
young and ingenuous minds, when sur- 
prised into situations where they attract 
the peculiar attention of thfeii- superiors. 
The glow of shame indicates, in the first 
instance, that the mind is not totally 
abandoned; in the last, it manifests a 
nice sense of honour and delicate feel- 
ings, united with inexperience and igno- 
rance of the world.

sins. 

SIBYLLINE ORACLES, prophe- 
cies delivered, it is said, by certain wo- 
men of antiquit)-, showing the fates and 
revolutions of kingdoms. We have a 
collection of them in eight books. Dr. 
Jorton observes, that they were com- 
posed at different times by different 
persons ; first by Pagans, and then, per- 
haps, by Jews, and certainly by Cliris- 
tians. They abound with phrases, 
words, facts, and passages, taken from 
the LXX, and the New Testament. 
They are, says the Doctor, a remarka- 
ble specimen of astonishing impudence 
and miserable poetry, and seem to have 
been, from first to last, and without any 
one exception, mere impostui-es. 

SIMONY, is the corrupt presenta- 
tion of any one to an ecclesiastical be- 
nefice, for money, gift, or reward. It 
is so called from the resemblance it is 



said to bear to the sin of Simon Magus, 
though the purchasing of holy orders 
seems to approach nearer to this of- 
fence. It was by the canon law a very 
grievous ciime; and is so much the 
more odious, because, as Sir Edwai'd 
Coke observes, it is ever accompanied 
with perjury; for the presentee is 
sworn to have committed no simony. 
However, it was not an offence punish- 
able in a criminal way at the common 
law, it being thought sufficient to leave 
the clerg}^ to ecclesiastical censures. But 
as these did not affect the simoniacal 
patron, nor were efficacious enough to 
repel the notorious practice of the thing, 
divers acts of parliament have been 
made to restrain it, by means of civil 
forfeitures, which the modern prevail- 
ing usage with regard to spiritual pre- 
ferments calls aloud to be put in exe- 
cution. 

SIN, the transgression of the law, ot 
want of conformity to the will of God, 
1 John iii. 4. 1. Original sin is that 
whereby our wliole nature is connipted, 
and rendered contrary to the law of 
God ; or, according to the 9th article of 
the church of England, " It is that 
whereby man is very far gone from ori- 
ginal righteousness, and is, of his own 
nature, inclined to evil." This is some- 
times called indwelling sin, Rom. vii. 
The imputation of the sin of Adam to 
his posterity is also what divines ge- 
nerally call, with some latitude of ex- 
pression, original sin. — 2. Actual sin is 
a direct violation of God's law, and ge- 
nerally applied to those who are capa- 
ble of committing moral ev'il; as op- 
posed to idiots, or children, who have 
not the right use of their powers. 3. Sina 
of 07nissio72 consist in the leaving those 
things undone which ought to be done. 
— 4. Sins of conunission are those which 
are committed against affirmative pre- 
cepts, or doing what should not be done. 
— 5. Sins of infirmity are those which 
arise from the infirmity of the flesh, ig- 
norance, sui'prise, snares of the world, 
&amp;c. See Infirmity. — 6. Secret sina 
are those committed in secret, or those 
which we, through blindness or preju- 
dice, do not see the evil of. Psalm xix. 
12. — 7. Prcsumfituous sins are those 
which are done boldly, and against 
light and conviction. See Presump- 
tion. — 8. Unpardonable sin is the de- 
nial of the truths of the Gosjiel ; with an 
open and malicious rejection of it. The 
reason why this sin is never forgiven, is 
not because of anv want of sufficiency in 
the blood of Christ, nor in the pardon- 
ing mercy of God, but because such 
as commit it never repent of it, but 



SIN 

teontmue obstinate and malignant until 
death. 

The corruption of human nature is, 
1. Universal as to the subjects of it. 
Rom. iii. 23. Isa. liii. 6. — 2. General, as 
to all the powers of man, Isa. L 6. — 
3. Awful, filling the mind with con- 
stant rebellion against God and his law. 
-="4. Hateful to God, Job xv. 16 ; and, 
—5. Punishable by him, 1 Sam. ii. 9, 
10. Rom. ii. 9. Why the Almighty per- 
mitted it, when his po^er could have 
prevented it, and how it is conveyed 
from parents to their children, form 
some of those deep things of God, of 
which we can know but little in the 
present state ; only this we are assured 
of, that he is a God of ti-uth, and that 
whatever he does, or permits, will ulti- 
mately tend to promote his glory. 
While we contemplate, therefore, the 
nature, the evil, the guilt, the conse- 
quence of sin, it is our happiness to re- 
flect, that he who permitted it hath pro- 
vided a remedy for it ; and that he " so 
loved the world, that he gave his only 
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth 
on him sliould not perish, but have ever- 
lasting life." See Atonement, Re-

SINCERITY, freedom from hypo- 
crisy or dissimulation. The Latin vvord 
sincerus, from whence our English 
word sincere is derived, is composed of 
siwe and cera, and signifies without wax, 
as pure honey, which is not mixed with 
any wax; thus denoting that sincerity 
is a pure and upright principle. The 
Greek word fiXixfivsia, translated sin- 
cerity, (2 Cor. i. 12.) signifies properly a 
judgment made of things by the liglit 
and splendour of the sun : as, in traffic, 
men hold up goods they are buying, to 
the light 01 the sun, to see if they can 
discover any defect in them. Thus, 
those who are truly sincere can bear 
the test of light, and are not afraid of 
having their principles and practices 
examined by it This word, however, 
iike many others, is abused, and often 
becomes a subterfuge for the ungodly 
and the indolent, who think that their 
Hiractice is nothing; but that sincerity, 
or a good heart, as they call it, is aU m 



id-l 



SIN 



all. But such deceive themselves, tor a 
tree is known by its fruits ; and true 
godly sincerity will evidence itself by 
serious inquiry, impartial examination, 
desire of instruction, unprejudiced judg- 
ment, devotedness of spirit, and uni- 
formity of conduct. Tlie reader will 
find this subject ably handled in Gur- 
nall's Christian Armour, vol. ii. p. 121, 
to 148. See Hypocrisy. 

SINGING, an ordinance of divine 
worship, in which we express our joy 
in God, and gratitude for his mercies. 
It has always been a branch both of na- 
tui'al and revealed religion, in all ages 
and periods of time. It was a part of 
the worship of the Heathens. It was 
practised by the people of God before 
the giving of the law of Moses, Exod. 
XV. also under the ceremonial law. Un- 
der the Gospel dispensation it is parti- 
cularly enjoined. Col. iii.. 16. Eph. v. 
19. It was practised by Christ and his 
apostles. Matt. xxvi. 30. and in the 
earliest times of Christianity. The 
praises of God may be sung privately in' 
the family, -but chiefly in the house of 
God ; and should be attended to with 
reverence, sincerity, joy, gratitude, and 
with the understanding, 1 Cor. xiv. 15. 
Among the Baptists, during the early 
part of their existence, psalmody was 
generally excluded as a human ordi- 
nance ; but some congregations having 
adoptedit about the beginning of the 18th 
century, a violent controversy was ex- 
cited. About the middle of the centu- 
ry, however, the praises of God were 
sung in e^^ery Baptist church. It is to 
be lamented, however, that this ordi- 
nance has not that attention paid to it 
which it deserves. That great divine. 
Dr. Jonathan Edwards, observes, that 
" as it is the command of God that all 
should sing, so aU should make con- 
science of learning to sing, as it is a 
thing that cannot be decently perform- 
ed at all without learning. Those, there- 
fore, (where there is no natural inability) 
who neglect to learn to sing, live in sin, 
as they neglect what is necessaiy in or- 
der to their attending one of the ordi- 
nances of God's worship." We leave 
those who are wilfully dumb in God's 
house to consider this pointed remark! 

Much has been said as to the use of 
instrumental music in the house of God. 
On the one side it is obsei-ved, that we 
ought not to object to it, because it as- 
sists devotion ; that it was used in the 
worship of God under the Old Testa- 
ment ; and that the worship of heaven 
is i-epresented by a delighttul union of 
vocal and uistrumental music. But on 
the other side, it is remarked, that

nothing should be done in or about God's 
worship without example or precept 
from tne New Testament; that, in- 
stead of aiding devotion, it often tends to 
draw off the mind from the right ob- 
ject ; that it does not accord with the 
simphcity of Christian worship ; that 
the practice of those who Uved under 
the ceremonial dispensation can be no 
rule for us; that not one text in the 
New Testament requires or authorises 
it by precept or example, by express 
words or fair inference ; arid that the 
representation of the musical harmony 
in neaven is merely figurative langiiage, 
denoting the happiness of the saints.

the arguments on either side ; but the

SLANDER, according to Dr. Bar- 
row, is uttering false speeches against 
our neighbour, to the prejudice of his 
fame^ safety, welfare ; and that out of 
malignity, vanity, rashness, ill nature, 
or bad design. The principal kinds of 
slander are these : 1. Charging others 
with facts they are not guilty of. — 2. Af- 
fixing scandalous names and odious cha- 
racters which they deserve not. — 3. As- 
persing a man's actions with foul names, 
importing that they proceed from evil 
principles, or tend to bad ends, when it 
doth not or cannot appear. — 4. Per- 
verting a man's words or acts disadvan- 
tageously by affected misconstruction. — 
5. Partial or lame representation of 
men's discourse or practice, suppressing 
some part of the truth, or concealing 
some circumstances which ought to be 
explained. — 6. Instilling sly suggestions 
which create prejudice in the hearers. — 
7. Magnifying and aggravating the faults 
of others. — 8. Imputing to our neigh- 
bour's practice^ judgment, or profession; 



evil consequences which have no foun* 

dation in truth. 

Of all the characters in society, a 
slanderer is the most odious, and the 
most likely to produce mischief. " His 
tongue," says the great Massilon, " is a 
devouring fire, which taiTilshes what- 
ever it touches; which exercises its 
fury on the good grain equally as on the 
chaff; on the profane as on the sacred; 
which, wherever it passes, leaves dnlj"* 
desolation and ruin ; digs even into the 
bowels of the earth ; turns into vile 
ashes what only a moment before had 
appeared to us so precious and brilliant ; 
acts with more violence and danger than 
ever, in the time when it was apparent- 
ly smothered up and almost extinct ; 
which blackens what it cannot con- 
sume, and sometimes sparkles and de- 
hghts before it destroys. It is an as- 
semblage of an iniquity, a secret pride, 
which discovers to us the mote in our 
brother's eye, but hides the beam which 
is in our own ; a mean envy, which, 
hurt at the talents or prosperity of 
others, makes them the subjects of its 
censures, and studies to dim the splen- 
dour of whate\er outshines itself; a 
disguised hatred, which sheds iii its 
speeches the hidden venom of the heart ; 
an unworthy duplicity which praises to 
the face, and tears in pieces liehind the 
back ; a shameful levity, wliich has no 
command over itself or words, and often 
sacrifices both fortune and comfort to 
the imprudence of an amusing conver- 
sation ; a deliberate barbarity, which 
goes to pierce an absent brother; a scan- 
dal, where we become a subject of shame 
and sin to' those who listen "to us; an in- 
justice, where we ravish from our bro- 
ther what is dearest to him. It is a rest- 
less evil, which disturbs society ; spreads 
dissention through cities and countries ; 
disunites the strictest friendship ;" is the 
source of hatred and revenge ; fills 
wherever it enters with disturbances and 
confusion ; and every where is an ene- 
my to peace, comfort, and Christian 
good breeding. Lastly, it is an evil full 
of deadly poison : whatever flows from 
it is infected, and poisons whatever it 
approaches; even its praises are em- 
poisoned ; its applauses malicious ; its 
silence criminal; its gestures, motions, 
and looks, have all their venom, and 
spread it each in their way. Still more 
dreadful is this evil when it is found 
among those who are the professed dis- 
ciples of Jesus Christ. Ah ! the church 
formerly held in horror the exhiI)itions 
of gladiators, and denied that believers, 
brought up in the tenderness and be- 
nignity of Jesus Christ, could innocently

feast their eyes with the blood and death 
of these unfortunate slaves, or form an 
harmless recreation of so inhuman a 
pleasure ; but these renew more detest- 
able sho\\rs ; for they bring upon the 
stage not infamous wretches devoted to 
death, but members of Jesus Christ, 
their brethren ; and there they enter- 
tain the spectators with wounds which 
they inflict on persons" who have de- 
*"oted themselves to God. Ban'oiu^s

SOBRIETY, freedom from any inor- 
dinate passion. " Sobriety," as one ob- 
serves, " is both tlie ornament and the 
defence of a Christian. It is requisite 
jn every situation, and in every enter- 
])rise ; indeed nothing can be done well 
Avithout it. Tlie want of sobriety is seen 
and felt by multitudes every day. With- 
out sobriety a man is exposed to the toss- 
ing of the merciless waves, destitute of an 
anchor. Sobriety is a security against the 
baneful inthience of turbulent passions; 
it is self-posscssion ; it is self-detence. It 
is necessaiy on all occasions : wlien we 
i-ead, when we hear, when we pray, 
when we converse, wlien we form 
schemes, when we pursue them, when 
we prosper, when we fail. Sobriety is 
necessary for all descriptions of charac- 
ter ; it is necessary for the young and 
for the old ; for the rich and tlie poor, 
for the wise and for the illiterate ; all 
need to ' be sober.' The necessity of 
sobriety is obvious, 1. In our inquu-ies 
after truth, as opposed to presumption. 
— 2. In our pursuit of this world, as op- 
posed to co\ etousness. — 3. In the use 
and estimate of the things of this world, 
as opposed to excess. — 4. In trials and 
afflictions, as o])posed to impatience. — 
5. In forming our judgment of others, 
as opposed to censoriousness. — 6. In 
speaking of one's self, as opposed to 
egotism. — Many motives might bevu'ged 
to- this exercise, as, 1. The general lan- 
guage of Scripture, 1 Pet. v. 8. Phil. iv. 
5, Tit. ii. 12. 1 Pet. iv. 7.-2. Our profes- 
sion as Christiiuis. — 3. The example of 
Jesus Christ, and 4. The near ap- 
proach of death and judgment." See 
Drunkenness, Moderation. 

SOCINIANS, a sect so called from 
Faustus Soclnus, who died in Poland in 
1604. There were two who bore the 
name Socinus, uncle and nephew, and 
both disseminated the same doctrine ; 
but it is the nephew who is generally 
considered as the founder of this sect. 
They maintain " that Jesus Christ was 
a mere man, who had no existence be- 
fore he was conceived by the Virgin 



Mary ; that the Holy Ghost is no dis- 
tinct person; but that the Father is 
truly and properly God. They own 
that the name of God is given in the 
holy Scriptures to Jesus Christ, but con- 
tend that it is only a deputed title, which, 
however, invests him with a great au- 
thority over all created beings. They 
deny "the doctrines of satisfaction and 
imputed righteousness, and say, that 
Christ only preached the truth to man- 
kind, set before them in himself an ex- 
ample of heroic viilue, and sealed his 
doctrines with his blood. Original sin 
and absolute predestination they esteem 
scholastic chimeras. Some of them 
likewise maintain the sleep of the soul, 
which, they say, becomes insensible at 
death, and is raised again with the body 
at the resurrection, when the good shall 
lie established in the possession of eter- 
nal felicity, while the wicked shall be 
consigned to a fire that will not tor- 
ment them eternally, but for a certain 
duration proportioned to their deme- 
rits." 

There is some difference, however, 
between ancient and modern Socinians. 
The latter, indignant at the name So- 
cinian, have appropriated to themselves 
that of Unitarians, and reject the no- 
tions of a miraculous conception and 
the worship of Christ ; both which were 
held by Socinus. Dr. Priestly has la- 
boured hard in attempting to defend 
this doctrine of the Unitarians, but Dr. 
Horsley, bishop of Rochester, has ably 
refuted the doctor in his Theological 
Tracts, which are worthy the perusal 
of every Christian, and especially every 
candidate for the ministry. 

Dr. Price agreed with the Socinians 
in the main, yet his system was some- 
what different. He believed in the 
pre-existence of Christ, and liUewise 
that he was more than a human being; 
and took upon him human nature for a 
higher puipose than merely revealing 
to mankind the will of God, and in- 
structing them in their duty and in the 
doctrines of religion. 

The Socinians flourished greatly in 
Poland about the year 1551: and J. 
Sicmicnius, palatine of Podolia, built 
purposely for their use the city of Ra- 
cow. A famous catechism was publish- 
ed, called the Racovian catechism : and 
their most able writers are known by 
the title of the Polones Fratrcs, or Po- 
loiiian Brethren. Their writings were 
I'e-published together, in the year 1656, 
in one great collection, consisting of six 
volumes in folio, under the title of 
BiblJotheca Frati-um. An account of 
these authoi's may be seen in Dr. Tout-

SOLDINS, so called trom their lead- 
er, one Soldin a Greek priest. They 
appeared about the middle of the fifth 
century in the kingdoms of Saba and 
Godolia. They altered the manner of 
the sacrifice of the mass ; their priests 
offered gold, their deacons incense, and 
their sub-deacons myrrh ; and this in 
memory of the like offerings made to 
the hifant Jesus by the wise men. 

Very few authors mention the Soldins, 
neither do we know whether they still 
suiisist. 

SOLFIDIANS, those who rest on 
faith alone for salvation, without any 
connexion with works ; or who judge 
themselves to be Christ's because they 
believe they are. 

SON OF' GOD, a term applied in the 
Sci'iptures not only to magistrates and 
saints, but more particularly to Jesus 
Christ. Christ, says Bishop Pearson, 
has a fourfold right to this title. 1. By 
generation, as begotten of God, Luke i. 
35. — 2. By commission, as sent by him, 
John X. 34, 36. — 3. By resurrection, as 
the first born, Acts xiii. 32, 33. — 4. By 
actual possession, as heir of all, Heb. i. 
2, 5. But, besides these four, many think 
that he is called the Son of God m such 
a way and manner as never any other 
was, is, or can be, because of his own 
divine natui-e, he being the true, proper, 
and natural Son of God, begot •. en by 
him before all worlds, John iii. 16. Roiii.

SORCERY, magic, conjuration. See 
Charms and Witchcraft. 

SORROW, uneasiness or grief, arising 
from the privation of some good we ac- 
tually possessed. It is the opposite to 
joy. Though sorrow may be allowable 
under a sense of sin, and when involved 



in troubles, yet we must beware of an 
extreme. Sorrow, indeed, becomes 
sinful and excessive when it leads us to 
slight our mercies ; causes us to be in- 
sensible to public evils ; when it diverts 
us from duty ; so oppresses our bodies 
as to endanger our li\es ; sours the 
spirit with discontent, and makes us in- 
attentive to the precepts of God's word, 
and ad\ice of our friends. In order to 
moderate our sorrows, we should con- 
sider that we are under the dii'ection of 
a wise and merciful Being ; that he per- 
mits no evil to come upon, us without a 
gracious design; that he can make our 
troubles sources of spiritual advantage ; 
that he might have afflicted us in a far 
greater degree ; that, though he has 
taken some, yet he has left many other 
comforts; that he has given many pro- 
mises of relief : that he has supported 
thousands in as great troubles as ours : 
and, finally, that the time is coming 
when he will wipe away all tears, gmd 
give to them that love him a crown of 
glory that fadeth not away.. See Re- 
signation. 

SOUL, that vital, immaterial, active 
substance, or principle, in man, where- 
by he perceives, remembers, reasons, 
and wills. It is rather to be described 
as to its operations, than to be defined 
as to its essence. Various, indeed, have 
been the opinions of philosophers con- 
cerning its substance. The lipicur.-ans 
thought it a subtile air, composed of 
atoms, or primitive corpuscles. The 
Stoics maintained it was a flame, or por- 
tion of heavenly light. The Cartesians 
make thinking the essence of the soul. 
Some hold that man is endowed witli 
three kinds of soul, viz. the rational, 
which is purely spiritual, and infused l)y 
the immediate inspiration of God: the 
irrational or sensitive, which being 
common to man and brutes, is supposed 
to be formed of the elements : and, 
lastly, the vegetative soul, or principle 
of growth andnutrition, asthefirst isof 
understanding, and the second of ani- 
mal life. 

The rational soul is simple, uncom- 
pounded, and inunaterial, not composed 
of matter and form ; for matter can 
never think and move of itself as the 
soul does. In the fourth volume of the 
Memoirs of the Literary and Philoso- 
phical Society of Manchester, the reader 
will find a very valuable paper, by Dr. 
Ferrier, proving by evidence appa- 
rently complete, that every part ci the 
brain has been injured without affecting 
the act of thought. It will be difficult 
for any man to peruse this without being 
convinced that tl\e modern theon- of the

Materialists is shaken from its very 
foundation. 

The immortality of the soul may be 
argued from its vast capacities, bound- 
less desires, great improvements, dis- 
satisfaction with the present state, and 
desire of some kind of religion. It is 
also argued from the consent of all na- 
tions ; the consciousness tiiat men have 
of sinning ; tlie sting of conscience ; the 
justice and providence of God. How 
far these arguments are conclusive 1 
will not say ; but the safest, and, in fact, 
the only sui'e ground to go upon to prove 
this doctrine is the word of God, where 
we at once see it clearly established.

thev were atterwai'ds explained to her. 
In November 1803, she was told to 
mark the weather during the twenty- 
four first days of the succeeding year, 
and then the Spirit informs her that the 
weather each day was typical of the 
events of each succeeding month : New 
year's day to correspond with January, 
January 2 with February, 8cc. 

After this she relates a^dream she 
had in 1792, and declares she foretold 
the death of Bishop BuUer, and appeals 
to a letter put into the hands of a cler- 
gyman whom she names.- 
^'CTne night she heard a noise as if a 
ball of iron was rolling down the stairs 
three ste/is ; and the Spirit afterwards, 
she says, told her this was a sign of three 
great evils which were to fall upon this 
land, the sivord, the plague, and the 
famine. She affirms that the late war, 
and that the extraordinary harvest of 
1797 and 1800, happened agreeably to 
the predictions which she had pre- 
viously made known j and particularly 



appeals to the people of Exeter, where 
it seems she was brought up from her 
infancy. 

In November 1803, she says she was 
ordered to open her Bible, which she 
did at Eccles. ch. i. 9 f.anA then follows 
a long explanation of that chapter. 

When she was at Stockton upon Tees 
in the next month, she informs us three 
methodist preachers had the confidence 
to tell her she uttered lies ; and she 
then refers them to four clergymen who 
could prove she and her friends were 
not liars. 

After this she gives us a long com- 
munication on Gen. xlix. wherein Ja- 
cob warns his sons of what should befall 
them in the last days, and which she 
applies to our present times. She then 
favours her readers with a long essay 
on tlie marriage of the Lamb, and as 
variety is always pleasing, it commences 
in sober prose, out ends in jingling 
rhyme. 

- Tlie following is the conclusion of a 
communication which she had at Stock- 
fort : " As wrong as they are, saying 
thou hast children brought ufi by the 
parish, and that thou art Bonaparte's 
brother, and that thou hast been in pri- 
son ; so false is their sayings, thy writ- 
ings came from the devil or any spirit 
but the spiRiTof the living God ; and 
that every soul in this nation shall know 
before the five. yEA,Rs I mentioned to 
thee in 1802 are expired; and then .1 
will turn as a diadem of beauty to the 
residence of my people, and they shall 
praise the God OF their salvation." 

In March 1805, we find Joanna pub- 
lished a pamphlet in London, endea- 
vouring to confute "Five Charges" 
against her, which had appeared in the 
Leeds Mercury, and four of v/hich she 
says were absolutely false. The Jirst 
charge was respecting the sealing of her 
disciples. The second on the invasion. 
The third on the famine. The fourth 
on her mission. The ffh on her 
death. Sealing is the grand pecuharity 
and ordinance of these people. Joanna 
gives those who profess belief in her 
mission, and will subscribe to the things 
revealed in her " Warning," a sealed 
written /la/ier with her signature, and 
by which they are led to think they are 
sealed against the day of redemption, 
and that all those who are possessed of 
these seals will be signally honoured by 
the Messiah when he comes this spring. 
It is said they looked upon Joanna to-be 
the bride, the Lamb's wife ; and that 
as man fell by a woman, he will be re- 
stored by a woman. Some of her fol- 
lowers pretended also to have visions and

revelations. At present, it seems, both 
warning and sealing have subsided ; they 
are v/aiting, probably in awful suspense, 
for the commencement of the thousand 
years' reign on the earth, when peace 
•will universally prevail. Yet it is said 
they do not mean that Christ will come 
in pei-son, but in spirit, and that the 
sealed who are dead before this time, 
will be raised from their graves to par- 
take in this hanpv state. 

SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD, is his 
po^ver and right of dominion over his 
creatures, to dispose and determine 
them as seemeth him good. This at- 
tribute is evidently demonstrated in the 
systems of creation, providence, and 
gi'ace ; and may be considered as abso- 
lute, universal, and everlasting, Dan. 
iv. 35. Eph. i. 11. See DoiMiNiON, 
Government, Power, and Will of 
God ; Coles on the .Sovereig7jty of God; 
and Charnock on the Dommion of God, 
in his Works, vol. i. p. 690 ; Edivards's 
Sermons, ser. 4. 

SPINOSISM, the doctrines of Spino- 
za, who was born a Jew at Amsterdam 
in 1632. The chief articles in his sys- 
tem are such as these : that there is. 
but one substance in nature, and that 
this only substance is endued with an 
infinite variety of attributes, among 
which are extension and cogitation ; 
that all the bodies in the universe are 
modifications of this substance, con- 
sidered as extended: and that all the 
souls of men are modifications of the 
same substance, considered as cogita- 
tive : that God is a necessary and infi- 
nitely perfect Being, and is the cause of 
all things that exist, but not a different 
Being from them : that there is but one 
Being, and one nature ; and that this 
nature produces within itself, by an im-' 
manent act, all those which we call 
creatures ; and that this Being is, at the 
same time, both agent and patient, effi- 
cient cause and subject, but that he 
produces nothing but modifications of 
himself. Thus is the Deity made the 
sole agent as well as patient, in all evil, 
both physical and moral. If this im- 
pious doctrine be not Atheism, (or, as it 
is sometimes called. Pantheism,) I 'know 
not what Is. See Pantheism. 

SPIRIT, an incoi-poi-eal being or intel- 
ligence ; in which sense God is said to 
be a Spirit, as are angels and the human 
soul. 

HOLY SPIRIT. See Holy Ghost. 

SPIRITUALITY OF GOD, is his 
immateriality, or being without body. 
It expresses an idea (says Dr. Paley) 
made up of a negative part and of a po- 
sitive part. The negative pai't consists 



in the exclusion of some of the kno\vn 
properties of matter, especially of soli- 
dity, of the vis inertiae, and of gravitation. 
The positive part comprises perception, 
thought, will, power, action, by which 
last term is meant the origination of mo- 
tion. J\''at. Theol. p. 481. See Incorpo- 

REALITY OF GOD. 

SPIRITUAL-MINDEDNESS, that 
disposition implanted in the mind by the 
Holy Spirit, by which it is inclined to 
love, delight in, and attend to spiritual 
things. The spiritual minded highly 
appreciate spiritual blessings — are en- 
gaged in spiritual exercises — pursue 
spiritual objects — are influenced by spi- 
ritual motives — and experience spiritual 
joys. To be spiritually-minded, savs 
St. . Paul, is life and peace, Rom. viii. 6. 
See Dr. Owen's excellent Treatise on 
this subject. 

SPONSORS, are those persons who, 
in the office of baptism, answer, or are 
sureties for the persons baptised. See 
Godfathers. 

SPORTS, Book of, a book or decla- 
ration drawn up l^y Bp. Morton, in the 
reign of K. James I. to encourage re- 
creations and sports on the Loi-d's day. 
It was to this effect : " That for his good 
people's recreation his Majesty's plea- 
sure was, that, after the end of divine 
service, they should not be disturbed, 
letted, or discouraged, from any lawful 
recreations ; such as dancing, either of 
men or women ; archery for men ; l(;afi- 
ing, -vaulting, or an)^ such harmless re- 
creations ; nor having of may-gaiiies, 
whitsonales, or morrice dances; or set- 
ting up of Afdy poles, and other sports 
therewith used, so as the same mav be 
had in due and' convenient time, without 
impediment or let of divine service ; and 
that women should have leave to carry 
rushes to the church for the decorating 
of it, according to their old customs; 
withal prohibiting aU unlawful games 
to be used on Sundays only ; as bear- 
baiting, bull-baiting, interludes, and at 
all times (in the meaner sort of people 
prohibited) bowling." Two or three 
restraints were annexed to the declara- 
tion, which deserve the reader's notice : 
1st. " No recus;uit (i. e. Papist) was to 
have the benefit of tliis declaration. — 
2dly. Nor such as were oot present at 
the whole of divine service. — Nor, 3dly. 
such as did not keep to their own parish 
churches, that is, Puritans." 

This declaration was ordered to be 
read in all the parish churches of Lan- 
cashire, which abound with Papists; 
and Wilson adds, that it was .to have 
been read in all the cliurches of E ig- 
land, but that Archbishop Abbot, being 
4 C 



STO 570 

at Cro)'don, flatly forbade its being read 
there. In the reign of King Charles I. 
Archbishop Laud put the king upon re- 
publishing this declaratioTi, which was 
accordingly done. The court had their 
balls, masquerades, and plays, on the 
Sunday evenings, while the youth of 
the country were at their morrice- 
dances, May-games, church and clerk 
ales, and all such kind of revelling. 
The severe pressing of this declaration 
made sad ha^-cc among the Puritans, as 
it was to be read in the churches. 
Many poor clergymen strained their 
consciences in submission to their supe- 
riors. Some, after publishing it, imme- 
diately read the fourth commandment 
to the people : — " Remember the Sab- 
bath day, to keep it holy :" adding, 
" This is the law of God :" the other, 
" The injunction of man." Some put 
it upon their curates, whilst great num- 
bers absolutely refused to comply : the 
consequence of which was, that several 
clergymen were actually suspended for 
not reading it. — Such, alas, was the aw- 
ful state ol the times ! 

STATUTE BLOODY, or the law of 
the six articles ; a law enacted in the 
reign of Henry VIII. which denounced 
death against all those who should deny 
the doctrine of transubstantiation ; or 
maintain the necessity of receiving the 
sacrament in both kinds, or affirm that 
it was lawful for priests to marry, that 
vows of celibacy might be bj'oken, that 
private masses were of no avail, and 
that auricular confession to a priest was 
net necessary to salvation. 

STEx\DFASTNESS. * See Con- 
stancy. 

STOICS, heathen philosophers, who 
took their names from the Greek word 
s/oa, signifying a porch, or portico, be- 
cause Zeno, the head of the Stoics, kept 
his school in a porch of the city of 
Athens. It is supposed that Zeno bor- 
rowed manv of his opinions from the 
Jewish Scriptures ; but it is certain that 
Socrates and Plato had taxight much of 
them before. The Stoics generally 
maintained that nature impels every 
man to pvu'sue whatever appears to 
him to be good. According to them, 
self-preservation and defence is the first 
law of animated nature. All animals 
necessarily derive pleasure from those 
things which are suited to them ; but the 
first object of pursuit is not pleasure, but 
conformity to nature. Every one, there- 
fore, who has a right discernment of 
Avhat is good, will be chiefly concerned 
to conf&lt;n-m to nature in all his actions 
and pursuits. This is tlie ongin of mo- 
ral obligation. With respect to happi- 



SUB 



ness or good, the stoical doctrine was 
altogether extraA-agant : they taught 
that all external things are indifferent 
and cannot affect the happiness of man ; 
that pain, whicli does not belong to the 
mind, is not evil ; and tliat a wise man 
will be happy in tlie midst of torture, 
because virtue itself is happiness. 

Of all the sects however of the an- 
cient philosophers, it is said that the 
Stoics came nearest the Christian ; and 
that not only with respect to their strict 
regard to moral virtue, but also on ac- 
covmt of tlieir moral principles ; inso- 
much, that Jerome aflirmsthat in manv 
things they agree with us. They as- 
serted the unity of the Divine Being — 
the creation of the world by the \ojcs, 
or Word — tlie doctrine of Providence — 
and the conflagration of the universe. 
They believed in the doctrbie of fate, 
which they represented as no other 
than the will and puiijose of God, and 
held that it had no tendency to loose- 
ness of life. 

STYLITES, pillar saints; an appel- 
lation given to a kind of solitaries, who 
stood motionless upon the tops of pillars, 
raised for the exercise of their patience, 
and remained there for several years, 
amidst the admiration and applause of 
the stupid populace. Of these, we find 
several mentioned in ancient writei-s, 
and even as low as the twelfth century, 
when they were totally suppressed. 

Tiie founder of the order was St. Si- 
meon Stylites, a famous anchoret in the 
fifth century, who fii-st took up his abode 
on a colunm six cubits high ; then on a 
second of twelve cubits ; a third of 
twenty-two ; a fourth of thirty-six ; and 
on another of forty cubits, where he 
thus passed thirty-seven years of his 
life. 'i"he tops of these columns were 
only three feet in diameter, and were 
defended by a rail that reached almost 
to the girdle, somewhat resembling a 
pulpit. There was no lying down in it. 
l"he Faquirs or devout people of the 
East, imitate this extraordinary kind of 
life to this day. 

SUB DEACON, an inferior minister, 
who anciently attended at the altar, 
prepared the sacred vessels, delivered 
them to the deacons in time of divine 
service, attended the doors of the church 
during communion sendee, went on the 
bishop's embassies with his letters, or 
messages, to foreign chiirches, and was 
invested with the first of the holy or- 
ders. They were so subordinate to the 
superior rules of the church, that, by 
a canon of the council of Laodicea, they 
were forbidden to sit in the presence of 
a deacon without his leave.

SUBLAPSARIANS; those who hold 
that God permitted the first man to fall 
into transgression without absolutel)^ 
predetermining his fall ; or that the de- 
cree of predestination regards man as 
fallen, by an abuse of that freedom which 
Adam had, into a state in which all were 
to be left to necessary and unavoidable 
ruin, who were not exempted from it 
by predestination; See Supralapsa- 

RIANS. 

SUBMISSION TO GOD implies an 
entire giving up of our understanding, 
will, and affections, to him ; or, as Dr. 
Owen observes, it consists in, 1. An 
acquiescency in his right and sove- 
reignty. — 2. An acknowledgment of his 
inghteousness and wisdom. — 3. A sense 
of his love and care. — 4. A diligent ap- 
plication of ourselves to his mind and 
will.— 5. Keepmg our souls by faith and 
patience from weariness and despon^ 
denc)^ — 6. A full resignation to his will. 
See Resignation, Sorrow. 

SUBSCRIPTION, CLERICAL.— 
Subscription to articles of religion is re- 
quired of the clergj' of every estaljlish- 
ed Qhurch, and of some churches not 
established. But it has been a matter 
of dispute whether it answers any 
valuable purpose as to religion, how- 
ever necessary as a test to loyalty. All 
language is more or less ambiguous, so 
that it is difficult always to understand 
the exact sense, or the animus imjw- 
nentis, especially when creeds have been 
long established. It is said that the cler- 
gy of the churches of England and Scot- 
land seldom consider themselves as 
fettered with the Thirt\'-nine Articles, 
or the Confession of Faith,'when com- 
posing instructions for their parishes, or 
the public at large. 

It is to be feared, indeed, that many 
subscribe merely for the sake of emolu- 
ment ; and though it be professedly ex 
animo, it is well known that it is not so 
in reality. How such will answer to the 
Great Head of the church, we must 
leave them to judge. They who think 
subscription to be proper, should re- 
member that it approaches very near 
the solemnity ©f an oath, and is not to be 
trifled with. *" Great care," says Dod- 
diidge, " ougWt to be taken that we sub- 
scribe nothing that we do not firmly be- 
lieve. If the signification of the words 
be dubious, and we believe either sense, 
and that sense in which we- do believe 
them is as natural as the other, we may, 
consistently with integrit}-, subscribe 
them ; or if the sense in which we do 
believe them to be less natural, and we 
explain that sense, and that explication 
be admitted by the person requiring the 



subscription in his own right, there can 
be no just foundation tor a scruple. 
Some have added, that, if we have rea- 
son to believe (though it is not expressly 
declared) that he who imposes the sub- 
scription does not intend that we should 
hereby declare our assent to those ar- 
ticles, but only that we should pay a 
compliment to his authority, and engage 
ourselves not openly to contradict them, 
we may, in this case, subscribe what is 
most directly contrary to our belief; or 
that, if we declare our belief in any 
book, as, for instance, the Bible, it is to 
be supposed that we subscribe other ar- 
ticles only so far as they are consistent 
with that ; because we cannot imagine 
that the law would require us to profess 
our l&gt;elief of contrary propositions at the 
same time. But subscription upon these 
principles seems a very dangerous at- 
tack upon sincerity and public virtue, 
especially in those designed for public 
offices." If the reader be desirous of in- 
vestigating the subject, he may consult,

SUCCESSION UNINTERRUPT- 
ED, a term made use of by the Roman- 
ists, and others, in reference to those 
bishops who are supposed to have de- 
rived their authority from the apostles, 
and so communicated that authority 
to others in a line, or succession. It is 
a very precarious and uncomfortable 
foundation for Christian hope (says Dr. 
Doddridge) which is laid in the doctrine 
of an uninterrupted succession of bi- 
shops, and which makes the validity of 
the administration of Christian ministers 
depend upon such a succession, since 
there is so great a darkness upon many 
periods of ecclesiastical history, inso- 
much that it is not agreed who were 
the seven first bishops of the church of 
Rome, though that church was so cele- 
brated; and Eusebius himself, from 
whom the greatest patrons of this doc- 
trine have made their catalogues, ex- 
pressly owns that it is no easv matter to 
tell who succeeded the apostles in the 
government of the churches, excepting 
such as may be collected from St. Paul's 
own words. [See Episcopacy.] Con- 
tested elections, in almost all consider- 
able cities, make it very dubious which 
were the true bishops ; and decrees of 
councils, rendering all those ordinations 
null where any simoniacal contract was 
the foundation of them, makes it impos- 
1 sible to prove that there is no^Y upcm

SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST. To 
form an idea of Christ's sufferings, Xve 
should considei- the poverty of his birth ; 
the I'eproach of his character ; the pains 
of his body ; the power of his enemies ; 
the desertion of his friends ; the weight 
of his people's sins ; the slow, ignomi- 
nious, and painful nature of his death ; 
and the hidings of his Father's face. 
All these rendered his sufferings ex- 
tremely severe ; yet some heretics said, 
that the sufferings of Christ were only 
in appearance, and not real : but, as Bi- 
shop Pearson observes, " If hunger and 
thirst ; if revilings and contempt ; if 
sorrows and agonies ; if stripes and but- 
feting ; if condemnation and crucifixion, 
be siifferings, Jesus suffered. If the in- 
firmities ot our nature ; if the weight of 
our sins ; if the malice of men ; if thfe 
machinations *of Satan ; if the hand of 
God, could make him suffer, our Sa- 
viour suffered. If the annals of time ; 
if the writings of the apostles ; if the 
death of his martyrs ; if the confession 
of Gentiles ; if the scoffs of the Jews, be 
testimonies, Jesus suffered." Pearson 
on the Creed; Dr. Rambach''s Medita- 
tions on the Sufferings of Christ. For 
the eiid of Christ's sufferings, see 
Death of Christ. 

SUNDAY, or the Lord's Day, a so- 
lemn festival observed by Christians on 
the first day of every week in memory of 
ourSaviour's resurrection. See Sabbath. 

It has been contended whether Sun- 
day is a name that ought to be used by 
Christians. The words Sabbath and 
Lord's Day, say some, are the only 
names mentioned in Scripture respecting 
this day. To call it Sunday, is to set our 
wisdom before the wisdom of God, and 
to give that glory to a Pagan idol wliich 
is due to him alone. The ancient Sax- 
ons called it bv this name, because upon 
it they worshipped the Sun ; and shall 
Christians keep up the memory of that 
which was highly displeasing to God, 
by calling the Sabbath by that name 
rather than by either of those he hath 
appointed i* It is, indeed, called Sunday, 
only because it is customary ; but this, 
sav they, will not justify men in doing 
that which is contrary to the example 
and command of God in his word. 



Others obser\'e, that although it was 
originally called Sunday, by the Hea- 
thens, yet it may very properly retain 
that name among Christians, because it 
is dedicated to the hojiour of the true 
light, which lighteth even' man that 
Cometh into the world, of Him who is 
styled by the prophet " the Sun of Right- 
eousness," and who on this day arose 
from the dead. But although it" was in 
the primitive times indifferently called 
the Lord's Day, or Sunday, yet it was 
never denominated the Sabbath ; a name 
constr^ntly appropriate to Saturday, 
or the seventh day, both by sacred 
and ecclesiastical writers. See Sab- 
bath. 

SUPEREROGATION, what a man 
does beyond his duty, or more than he 
is commanded to do. The Romanists 
stand up strenuously for works of su- 
pererogation, and maintain that the ob- 
servance of evangelical councils is such. 
By means hereof a stock of merit is laid 
up, which the church has the disposal 
of, and which she distributes in indul- 
gences to such as need. 

This absurd doctrine was first invent- 
ed towards the close of the twelfth cen- 
tury, and modified and embellished by 
St. Thomas in the thirteenth : accord- 
ing to which, it was pretended that there 
actually existed an immense treasure 
of merit, composed of the pious deeds 
and virtuous actions which the saints 
had performed beyond what was neces- 
sa.r\r for their own salvation, and which 
were, therefore, applicable to the bene- 
fit of others; that the guardian and 
dispenser of this precious treasure was 
the Rom art pontiff; and that, of conse- 
quence, he was empowered to assign to 
such as he thought proper, a portion of 
this inexhaustible source of merit, suit- 
able to their respective guilt, and suffi- 
cient to deliver them from the punish- 
ment due to their crimes. 

SUPERINTENDENT, an eccle- 
siastical superior in several reformed 
churches where episcopacy is not ad- 
mitted, particularly among the Lu*- 
therans in Germany, and the Calvinists 
in some other places, '^he superin- 
tendent is similar to a bishop, only his 
power is somewhat md^e restrained 
than that of our diocesan bishops. He 
is the chief pastor, and has the direction 
of all the inferior pastors within his dis- 
trict or diocess. 

SUPERSTITION is a word that has 
been used so indefinitely, that it is diffi- 
cult tq determine its precise meaning. 
From its resemblance in sound to the 
Latin word sufierstes, a .survivor, it is 
evidently derived from it ; and different

attempts have been made to trace their 
connexion in signification, but without 
any degree of certainty. It is gene- 
rally defined to be, the observance of 
unnecessary and uncommanded rites 
and practices in religion ; re\ erence of 
objects not fit for worship; too great 
nicety, fears, or scnapulousness ; or ex- 
travagant devotions ; or religion wrong 
directed or conducted. The word may 
be applied to the idolatry of the Hea- 
thens, the traditions of the Jews, the 
• unscriptural rites of the Catholics; to 
the dependence placed by many on bap- 
tism, the Lord's supper, and other cere- 
monies. It may be extended to those, 
who, without any evidence, believe that 
prophecies are still uttered, or miracles 
are performed. It is also applied to 
those who believe in witchcraft, magic, 
omens, &amp;c. 

Superstition, says Claude, usually 
springs either, 1. From stfTvile feai; 
which makes people believe that God 
is always wrathful, and invents means 
to appease him. — 2. Or from a natural 
inclination we all have to idolatry, 
which makes men think they see some 
ray of the Divinity in exti-aordinary 
creatures, and on this account worship 
them. — Or, 3. From hypocrisy, which 
makes men willing to discharge their 
obligations to God by grimace, and by 
zeal for external sei'vices. — Or, 4. From 
presumfition, which makes men serve 
God after their own fancies. Claude's

SUPRx\LAPSARIANS, persons who 
hold that God, without any regard to 
the good or evil works of men, has re- 
solved,, by an eterjial decree, s«/zra lap- 
sum, antecedently to any knowledge of 
the fall of Adam, and independently of 
it, to save some and reject others : or, 
in other words, that God intended to 
glorify his justice in the condemnation 
of sorne, as well as his mercy in the sal- 
vation of others ; and, for that pui-pose, 
decreed that Adam, should necessarily 
fall. 

• Dr. Gill gives us the following account 
of Supralapsarianism. — The question 
which he proposes to discuss, is, " W'^he- 
ther men were considered in the mind 
of God in the decree of election as fallen 
or unfdllen, as in the corrupt mass 
through the fall, orjii the pure mass of 
creatureship, previous to it, and as to be 
created ?" There are some who think 
that the latter, so considered, were the 
objects of election in the divine mind. 
Thc^e are called Supralapsarians, 



though of ^ these, some are of opinion 
that man was considered as to be created 
or creatable, and othei's as created but 
not fallen. The former seems best, that, 
of Che vast number of individuals which 
Came up in the divine mind whom his 
power could create, those whom he 
meant to bring into being he designed 
to glorify himself by them in some way 
or other'. The tlecree of election re- 
specting any part of them, may be dis- 
tinguished into the decree of the end 
and the decree of the means. The de- 
ci'ee of the end respecting some is ei- 
ther subordinate to their eternal happi- 
ness, or ultimate, which is more proper- 
Iv the end, the glory of God ; and if 
both are put together, it is a state of 
everlasting communion with God, for 
the glorifying of the riches of his grace. 
The decree of the means includes the 
decree to create men to permit them to 
fall, to recover them gut of it through 
redemption by Christ, to sanctify them 
bv the grace of the Spirit, and com- 
jjietely save them ; and which are not 
to be reckoned as materially many de- 
crees, but as making one formal decree ; 
or they are not to be considered as sub- 
ordinate, but as co-ordinate means, and 
as making up one entire complete me- 
dium ; for it is not to be supposed that 
God decreed to create man, that he 
might permit him to fall, in order to re- 
deem, sanctifvj and save him ; but he 
decreed all this that he might glorify 
his grace, mercy, and justice. And in 
this way of considering the decrees of 
God, they think that they sufficiently 
obviate and remove the slanderous 
calumny cast upon them with respect 
to the other branch of predestination, 
which leaves men in the same state 
when others are chosen, and that for 
the glory of God. Which calumny is, 
that, according to them, God made inau 
to damn him ; whereas, according to their 
real sentiments, God decreed to make 
man, and made man neither to damn 
him nor save him, but for his own glory, 
which end is answered in them some 
way or other. — Again ; they argue that 
the end is first in view before the means, 
and the decree of the end is, in order of 
nature, before the decree of the means ; 
and what is first in intention, is last in 
execution. Now, as the glory of God 
is last in execution, it must be first in 
intention, wherefore men must be con- 
sidered in the decree of the end as not 
yet created and fallen ; since the crea- 
tion and permission of sin belong to the 
deci'ee oi the means, which in order of 
nature is after the deci-ee of the end. 
And thev add to this, that if God first 



SUP 



574 



bUS 



decreed to create man, and suffered him 
to fall, and then out of the fall chose 
some to grace and glory, he must de- 
cree to create man without an end, 
which is to make God to do wliat no 
wise man would; for when a man is 
about to do any thing, he proposes an 
end, and then contrives and lixes on 
ways and means to bring about that end. 
They think also that this way of con- 
ceiving and speaking of these things, 
best expresses the sovereignty of God 
in them, as declared in the 9th of Ro- 
mans, where he is said to will such and 
such things, for no other reason but be- 
cause he wills them. 

The opponents of this doctrine con- 
sider, however, that it is attended with 
insuperable difficulties. We demand, 
say they, an explanation of what they 
mean by this principle, "God hatli 
made all things for his own glory." If 
they mean that justice requires a crea- 
ture to devote himself to tlie worship 
and glorifying of his Creator, wc grant 
it ; if they mean that tlie attriljutes of 
God are displayed in all his works, we 
&lt;j,rant this too : but if the proposition be 
intended to affirm that God liad no 
other view in creating men, so to speak, 
than his own interest, we deny the pro- 
position, and affirm that God created 
men for their own happiness, and in or- 
der to have subjects upon whom "he 
might Ijestow favours. 

We desire to be informed, in the next 
place, say they, how it can be conceived 
that a determination to damn millions of 
men can contribute to the glory of God ? 
We easily conceive, that it is for the 
glory of divine justice to punish guilty 
irien : but to resolve to damn men with- 
out the consideration of sin, to create 
tliem that tiiey miglit sin, to determine 
that tlicy s'hoidd sin in order to their de- 
struction, is what seems to us more 
likelj' to tarnish the glory of God tlian 
to display it. 

Again; we demand how, according 
to this hypothesis, it can be conceived 
that God is not the author of sin i* In the 
general scheme of our churches, God 
only permits men to sin, and it is the 
abuse of liberty that plunges man into 
miseiy : even this pruiciple, all lenified 
as it seems, is yet subject to a great 
nvmiber of difficulties ; but in this 
scheme, God wills sin to pi-oduce the 
end he proposed in creating the world, 
and it was necessary -that men sho&gt;ild 
sin : God created them for that. If this 
be not to make God the author of sin, 
we must renounce the most distinct and 
clear ideas. 
Again; we require them to reconcile 



this system with many express declara- 
tions of Scripture, which mform us that 
God would have uU men to be saved. 
How doth it agree with such pressing 
entreaties, such cutting reproofs, such 
tender expostulations, as God discovers 
in regard to the unconverted? Matt, 
xxiii. 37. 

Lastly, we desire to know, how is it 
possible to conceive a God, who, being 
ui the actual enjoyment of perfect hap- 
piness, incomprehensible, and supreme, 
could determine to add this decree, 
though useless, to his felicity, to create 
men without number for the purpose of 
confining them for ever in the chains of 
darkness, and burning them for ever in 
unquenchable flames. Gill's Body of 
Dlv. vol. i. p. 299; Brine's Woi-ka ;

SUPREMACY OF THE POPE, a 
doctrine held by the- Roman Catholics, 
'who believe that the bisliop of Rome is, 
under Christ, supreme pastor of tl\e 
whole church; and, as such, is not only 
the first bishop in order and dignity, 
but has also a power and jurisdiction 
over all Christians. This doctrine is 
chiefly built upon the supposed primacy 
of St. Peter, of whom the bishop of 
Rome is the pretended successor; a 
primacy we no- where find commanded 
or countenanced, but absolutely prohi- 
bited, in the word of God, Luke xxii. 
14, 24. Mark ix. 35. See I.ntfallibi- 
LiTY, Primacy, Pope, and Popery ; 
Dr. Barrow's Treatise on the Pofie's 
Sufircmacy ; Chillingworth's Religion 
of the Protestants ; and Smith's Er- 
rors of the Church of Rome. 

SUPREMACY, Oath of. See

SUSPICION consists in imagining 
evil of others without prqof. It is some- 
times opposed to charity, which think- 
eth no evil. " A suspicious temper 
checks in the bud every kind affection ; 
it hardens the heart, and estranges man 
from man. What fiiendship can we 
expect from him who views all our con- 
duct with distrustful eyes, and ascribes 
every benefit we confer to artifice and 
stratagem ? A candid man is accustomed 
to view the characters of his neigh- 
bours in the most favourable light, and 
is like one who dwells amidst those 
beautiful scenes of nature on which the 
eye rests with pleasure. Whereas the 
suspicious man, hdfcing his imagination 
filled with all the shocking forms of hu- 
man falsehood, deceit, and treachery, 
resembles the traveller in the wilder- 
ness, who discerns no objects ai-ound 
him but what are either dreary or ter-

SWEARING. See Oath. 

Cursing and Sweari72g is an offence 
against God and reUgion, and a sin of 
all others the most extravagant and un- 
accountable, as having no benefit oi- ad- 
vantage attending it. It is a contempt 
of God ; a violation of his law ; a great 
breach of good behaviour ; and a mark 
of levity, weakness, and wickedness. 
How those who live in the habitual prac- 
tice of it can call themselves men of 
sense, of character, or of decenc)', I 
know not. By the last. statute against 
this crime, 19 George II. which repeals 
all former ones, every labourer, sailor, 
or soldier, profanely cursirtg or swear- 
ing, shall forfeit one shilling; every 
other person, under the rank of a gen- 
tleman, two shillings; and every gen- 
tleman, or person of superior rank, five 
shillings, to the poor of the parish ; and 
on a second conviction, double, and for 
every subsequent o'fFence treble the sum 
first forfeited, with all charges of con- 
viction ; and, in default of paniient, 
shall be sent to the house of correction 
for ten days. 

SWEDEN BORGIANS, the follow- 
ers of Emanuel Swedenborg, a Swedish 
nobleman, born at Stockholm in 1689. 
He appears to have had a good educa- 
tion ; for his learning was extensive in 
almost every branch. He professed 
himself to be the founder of the New 
.lerusalem Church, alluding to the New 
Jerusalem spoken of in the book of the 
Revelation. He asserts that, in the year 
1743, the Lord manifested himself to 
him by a personal appearance, and at 
the same time opened his spiritual eyes, 
so that he.was enabled constantly to' see 
and converse with spirits and angels. 
From that time he began to print and 

Eublish various wonderful things, which, 
e says, were revealed to him, relating 
to heaven and hell, the state of men af- 
ter death, the worship of God, the spi- 
ritual* sense of the Scriptures, the va- 
rious earths in the universe, and their 
inhabitants; with many other strange 
particulars. 

Swedenborg lived and died in the 
Lutheran communion, but always pro- 
fessed the highest respect for the'church' 
of England. He carried his respect for 
the pei-son and divinity of Jesus Christ 
to the highest point of veneration, con- 
sidering him altogether as " God mani- 
fested in the flesh, and as the fulness of 
the Godhead united to the man Christ 
Jesus." With respect, therefore, to the 
sacred Trinity, though he rejected the 
idea of three distinct persons as de- 



stnictivc of the unity of the Godheafl, 
he admitted three distinct essences, prin- 
ciples, or characters, as existing in it ; 
namely, the divine essence or cha- 
racter, in virtue of which he is called 
the Father or Creator ; the human es- 
sence, principle, or charactei-, united to 
the divine in the person of Jesus Christ, 
in ^•irtue of which he is called the Son 
and Redeemer ; and, lastly, the pro- 
ceeding essence or principle, in virtue of 
which he is called the Holy Ghost. He 
farther maintains, that the sacred Scrip- 
ture contains three distinct senses, 
called celestial, spiritual, and natural, 
which are united by correspondences ; 
and that in each sense it is divine trutli 
accommodated respectively to the an- 
gels of the three heavens, and also to 
men on earth. This science of corres- 
pondence (it is said) has been lost for 
some thousands of years, viz. ever since 
the time of Job, but is now revived by 
Emanuel Swedenborg, who uses it as a 
key to the spiritual or internal sense of 
tlie sacred Scripture ; every page of 
which, he says, is written by corres- 
pondence, that is, by such things in the 
natural world as correspondent unto and 
signify things in the spu'itual world. He 
denies the doctrine ot atonement, or vi- 
carious sacrifice ; together with the 
doctrines of predestmation, uncondi- 
tional election, justification by faitli 
alone, the resurrection of the material 
body, &amp;c. and, in. opposition thereto, 
maintains that man is possessed of free 
will in spiritual things ; that salvation is 
not attaniable without repentance, that 
is, abstaining from e\ ils, because they 
are sins against God, and living a life of 
charity and faith, according to the com- 
mandments ; that man, immediately pii 
his decease, rises again in a spiritual bo- 
dy, which was enclosed in his material 
body ; and that in this spiritual body he 
lives as a man to eternity, either in hea- 
ven or in hell, according to the quality 
of his past life. That all those passages 
in the Scripture generally supposed to 
signify the destruction of the world by 
fire, and commonly called the last judg- 
ment, must be understood according to 
the above-mentioned science of cor- 
respondences, which teaches, that by 
the end of the world, or consummation 
of the age, is not signified the destiiic- 
tion of the world, but the destniction 
or end of the present Christian church, 
both among Roman Catholics and Pro- 
testants, of every description or deno- 
mination;, and that this last judgment- 
actually took place in the spiritual 
world in the year 1757; from which 
sera is dated tlvp second advent of ih:-

thing moral by the figures or properties 
of natural things. Hence symbols are 
of various kinds; as hieroglyphics, 
types, enigmas,, parables, fables, &amp;c.

SYNAGOGUE, a place where the 
Je\Vs meet to worship God. 

SYNERGISTS, so called from the 
Greek o-uvtyytia, which signifies co-ope- 
ration. Hence this name was given to 
those in the sixteenth century who de- 
nied that God was the sole agent in the 
conversion of sinful man, and affirmed 
that man co-operated with divine grace 
in the accomplishment of this salutary 
purpose. 

Synod, a meeting or assembly of 
ecclesiastical persons to consult on mat- 
ters of religion. Oi these there are four 
kinds, viz. 1. General, where bishops, 
&amp;C. meet from all nations. These were 
first called by the emperors ; iifterwards 
by Christian princes ; till in later ages, 
the pope usui-ped to himself the great- 
est share in this business, and by his le- 
gates presided in them when called. — 2. 
Mdtional, where those of one nation only 
come together to determine an}- point 



of doctrine or discipline. The firstof 
this sort Avhich Ave read of in England 
was that of Heinidford, or Hertford, in 
673 ; and the last was that held by- 
Cardinal Pole, in 1555. — 3. Provincial, 
where those only of one province meet, 
now called the convocation. — 4. Dio- 
cesan, where those of but one diocess 
meet, to enforce canons made by ge- 
neral councils, or national and provincial 
'synods, and to consult and agree upon 
rules of discipline for themselves. These 
were not wholly laid aside, till, by the 
act of submission, 25 Hen. Vlll. c. 19. 
it was made unlawful for any synod to 
meet, but by royal authority. See Coun- 
cil and Convocation. . . 

SYRIAN CHRISTIANS. The num- 
ber of S} rian churches is greater than 
has been supposed. There are, at this 
time, fifty-fi\e churches in Malayala, 
acknowledging the Patriarch of Antioch. 
The church was erected by the present 
bishop, in 1793. See Evang. Mag. for 
1807, p. 480. 

The Syrian Christiansare notNesto- 
rians. Formerlj', indeed, they had bi- 
shops of that communion ; but the li- 
turgy of the present church is derived 
fi'om that of the early church of Anti- 
och, called jMur'gia Jacobi Apostoli. 
They are usually denominated Jaco- 
bitx; but they differ in teremonial 
from the church of that name in Syria, 
and indeed from any existing church in 
the woi-ld. Their proper designation, 
and that which is sanctioned by their 
own use, is, Syrian Christians, or the 
Svrian Church' of Malayala. 

The doctrines of the" Syrian church 
are contained in a very few articles; 
and are not at variarce, in essentials, 
with the doctrines of the cjiurch of 
England.

There are Talapoinesses, too, or nuns, 
who live in the same convents, but are 
not admitted till they have passed their 
fortieth year. The Talapoins educate 
children, and at every new and full 
moon explain the precepts of their re- 
ligion hi tneir temples ; and, during the 
rainy season, tliey preach from six in 
the morning till noon, and from one in 
the afternoon till five in the exening. 
They dress in a very mean garb, and go 
bare-headed, and bare-footed ; and no 
person is admitted among them who is 
not well skilled in the Baly language. 
They believe that the universe is eter- 
nal, but admit that certain parts of it, 
as this world, may be destroyed, and 
again regenerated. They belie\'e in a 
universal pervading spirit, and in the 
immortality and transmigration of tlie 
soul ; but they extend this last doctrine 
not only to animals, but to vegetables 
and rocks. They have their good and 
evil genii, and particular local deities, 
who preside over forests and rivers, and 
mtertere in all subhuxary affairs. 

TALENT, figurati^ ely, signifies any 
gift or opportunity God gives to men for 
the promotion of his glory. " Every 
thing almost," says Mr. Scott, '' that 
we are, or possess, or meet with, maj' 
be considered as a talent; for a good or 
a bad use may be made of exery natural 
endowment, or providential appoint- 
ment, or they may remain unoccupied 
through inactivity and selfishness. Time, 
healtli, vigour of body, and the powei- of 
exertion and enduring fatigue — the na- 
tural and acquired abilities of the mind, 
skill in any lawful art or science, and 
the capacity for close rhental applica- 
tion — the gift of speech, and that of 
speaking with fluency and propriety, 
and in a convincing, attractive, or per- 
suasive manner — wealth, influence, or 
authority — a man's situation in the 
church, the community, or relative life 
—and the various occurrences which 
make way for him to attempt any thing 
of a beneficial tendency; these, and 
many others that can scarcely be enu- 
merated, are talents which the coiisist- 
ent Christian will improve to the glory 
of God, and the benefit of mankind. 
Nay, this improvement pi-ocures an in- 
crease of talents, and gives a man an 
accession of influence, and an accumu- 
lating power of doing good ; because it 
tends to establish his reputation for pru- 
dence, piety, integrity, sincerity, and 
disinterested benevolence : it gradually 
forms him to an habitual i-eadiness to 
engage in the beneficent designs, and to 
conduct them in a gentle,' unobtrusive, 
and unassuming manner: it disposes 



; others to regard him with increasing 
j confidence and affection, and to approach 
, him with satisfaction ; and it procures 
for him the countenance of many per- 
sons, whose assistance he can employ in 
accomplishing his own salutary pur- 
poses. 

TALMUD, a collection of Jewish 
writings. There are two woi'ks which 
bear this name — the Talmud of Jeru- 
salem, and the Talmud of Baby ion. 
Each of these are composed of two 
parts — the Mishna, which is the text, 
and is common to both; and the Gema- 
ra, or commentary, i 

The Mishna, which comprehends all 
the laws, institutions, and rules of life 
(which, besides the ancient Hebrew 
Scriptures, the Jews thought themselves 
bound to observe,) was composed, ac- 
cording to the unanimous testimony of, 
the Jews, about the close of the second 
centiu'y. It was tlie work of rabbi Je- 
huda (or Juda) Hakkadosh, who was 
the ornament of the school of Tiljcrias, 
and is said to have occupied him iorty 
years. The commentaries and addi- 
tions which succeeding rabbies made, 
were collected by rabbi Jochanan Ben 
Eliezer, some say in the fifth, others in 
tlie sixth, and others in the se\enth cen- 
tury, under the name of Gemara, that 
is, comjiLction, because it completed the 
Talmud. A similar addition was made 
to the Mishna by the Babylonish doc- 
tors in the beginning of the sixth cen- 
tury, according to Enfield ; and in the 
se\ enth, accoi'ding to others. 

The Mishna is divided into six parts, 
of which every one which is entitled 
order, is formed of treatises : e\'ery trea- 
tise is dix'ided into chapters ; and every 
chapter into mislmas or aphorisms. In 
the JirRt part is discussed whatever re- 
lates to seeds, fruits, and trees : in the 
second, feasts : in the third, women, 
their duties, their disorders, marriages, 
divorces, conti-acts, and nuptials ; in the 
fourth, are treated the damages or losses 
sustained by beasts or men, of things 
found, deposits, usuries, rents, farms, 
partnership in commerce, inheritance, 
sales and purchases, oaths, witnesses, 
arrests, idolatry ; and here are named 
those by whom the or-al law was receiv- 
edand preserved : in the fifth part are 
noticed what regards sacrifices and holy 
things: and the sixth treats on puri- 
fications, vessels, furniture, clothes, 
houses, leprosy, baths, and numei'ous 
other articles :— all this forms the Mishna. 
As the leamed reader may wish to ob- 
tain some notion of rabbinicjil contvposi- 
tion and judgment, we bhall gratify his 
curiosity suiTicientlv by the following 
4 t&gt;

specimen : " Adam's body was made of 
tlie earth of Babylon, his head of the 
land of Israel, his other itunnbers of 
other parts of the world. R. Meir 
thought he was compact of the earth 
gathered out of the whole earth : as it 
IS written, thine eyes did see my sub- 
stance. Now it is elsewhere written, 
the eyes of the Lord are over all the 
earth. R. Aha expressly marks the 
twelve hours in which his various parts 
were formed. His statui-e was from 
one end of the world to the other ; and 
it was for his transgression that the 
Creator, laying his hand in anger on 
him, lessened him ; ' for before,' says 
R. Eleazer, ' with his hand he i-eached 
the firmament.' R. Jehuda thinks his 
sin was heresy; but R. Isaac thinks 
that it was nourishing his foreskin." 

The Talmud of Babylon is most va- 
lued by the Jews ; and this is the book 
Avliich they mean to express when they 
talk of the Talmud in general. An 
abridgment of it was made by Maimo- 
nides in the 12th century, in which he 
i-ejected some of its greatest absurdi- 
ties. The Gemara is stuffed with dreams 
and chimeras, with many ignorant and 
impertinent questions, and the style 
very coarse. The Mishna is written in 
a style comparatively pure, and may be 
\QY\ useful in explaining passages of 
the New Testament, where the phrase- 
ology is similar. This is, indeed, the 
only use to which Christians can apply 
it : but this renders it valuable. — Light- 
foot has judiciously availed himseit of 
such information as he could tlerive 
from it. Some of the popes, with a 
barbarous zeal, and a timidity of spirit, 
for the sviccess of the Christian religion, 
which tlic belief of its divinity can ne- 
ver excuse, ordered great numbers of 
the Tahnudto be burned. Gregory IX. 
bumed about twenty cart-loads ; and 
Paul lY. ordered 12,000 copies of the 
Talmud to be destroyed. See Mischna, 
the last edition of the Talmud of Baby- 
lon, printed at Amsterdam, in 12 vols, 
folio : the Talmud of Jerusalem is in one 
large volume folio. 

TANQUELINIANS, so called from 
Tanquelinus, who formed a numerous 
denomination in Brabant and Antwerp 
in the twelfth century. He treated 
with contempt the external worship of 
Go:1, tl\e sacrament of the Lord's sup- 
per, and the rite of baptism, and held 
clandestine assemblies to propagate his 
opinions. He declaimed against the 
vices of tlie clergy with vehemence and 
intrepidity. 

T VRGUM, a name given to the 
Chaldee paraphrases of the books of the 



Old Testament. They are called jiara- 
fihrases, or expositions, because they 
are rather comments and explications, 
than literal translations of the text. 
They are written in the Chaldee tongue, 
which became familiar to the Jews after 
the time of their captivity in Babylon, 
and was more known to them than the 
Hebrew itself; so that when the He- 
brew text was read in the synagogue, or 
in the temple, they generally added to 
it an explication in the Chaldee tongue 
for the service of the people, who had 
but a very imperfect knowledge of the 
Hebrew tongue. It is probable, that 
even from the time of Ezra, this custom 
began : since this learned scribe, I'ead- 
ing the law to the people in the tem- 
ple, explained it, with the other priests 
that were with him, to make it under- 
stood by the people, Neh. viii. 7, 9. 

But though the custom of making 
these sorts of expositions in the Chal- 
dee language, be very ancient among 
the Hebrews, yet they have no written 
paraphrases or Tt\rgums before the xra 
of Onkelos and Jonathan, who lived 
about the time of our Saviour. Jona- 
than is placed about thirty years lie- 
fore Chi'ist, under the reign of Herod 
the Great. Onkelos is something more 
modern. The Targum of Onkelos is 
the most of all esteemed, and copies are 
to be found in which it' is inserted verse 
for verse with .the Hebrew. It is so 
short, and so simple, that it cannot be 
suspected of Ijeing corrupted. This 

Sai-aphrast wi'ote only upon the books of 
loses ; and his style approaches nearly 
to the purity of the Chaldee, as it is 
found in Daniel' and Ezra. This Tar- 
gum is quoted in the Misna, but was not 
known either to Eusebius, St. Jerom, or 
Origen. 

The Targum of Jonathan, son of 
Uziel, is upon the greater and lesser 
prophets. He is much more diftuse 
than Onkelos, and especially upon the 
lesser prophets, where he takes greater 
liberties, and injiis on in allegories. His 
style is pure enough, and approaches 

firetty near to the Chaldee ot Onkelos. 
t is thought that the Jewish doctors, 
who lived above seven hundred years 
after him, made some additions to him. 
The Targum of Joseph the Blind is 
upon the Hagiograpliia. This author is 
much more modem, and less esteemed, 
than those v/e have now mentioned. He 
has written upon the Psalms, Job, the 
Proverbs, the Canticles, Ecciesiastes, 
Ruth, and Esther. His style is a very 
corrujit Chaldee, with a great mixture 
of words from foreign languages. 
The Targimi ot Jerusalem is only 



TEM 

upon the Pentateuch ; nor is that entire 
or perfect. There are whole \'erses 
wanting, others transposed, others inu- 
tilated ; which has made many of opi- 
nion that this is only a fragment of some 
ancient paraphrase that is now lost. 
There is no Targmn upon Daniel, or 
upon the books of Ezra and Nehe- 
miah. 

These Targums are of great use for 
the better understanding not only of the 
Old Testament, on which they ai'e 
written, but also of the New. As to the 
Old Testament, they serve to vindicate 
the genuineness of the present Hebrew 
text, by proving it to be the same that 
was in use when these TargT*ms were 
made ; contrary to the opinion of tliose 
who think the Jews corrupted it after 
our Saviour's time. They help to ex- 
plain many words and jjhrases in the 
Hebrew original, and they hand down 
to us many of the ancient customs of 
the Jews. And some of them, with the 
phraseologies, idioms, and peculiar forms 
of speech, which we find in them, do, in 
many instances, help as much for the 
better illustration and better understand- 
ing of the New Testament, ?.s of the 
Old ; the Jerusalem Clialdee dialect, in 
which they are written, being the vul- 
gar language of the Jews in our Sa- 
viour's time. They also very much 
serve the Christian cause against the 
Jews, by interpreting many of the pro- 
jjhecies of the Messiah in the Old Tes- 
tament in the same manner as the Chris- 
tians do. iVIany instances ai-e produced 
to this purpose by Dr. Prideaux in his 
Connexions of the History of the Old 
and A'ew Testameyit. These Targums 
arc published to the best advantage in 
the second edition of the great Hebrew 
Bible set forth at Basil by Buxtorf, the 
father, anno 1610. 

TEMPER, the disposition of the 
mind, whether natural or acquired. The 
word is seldom used by good writers 
without an epithet, as a good or bad 
temper. Temper m.ust be distinguish- 
ed from passion. The passions are 
qiiick and. strong emotions v.hicli by de- 
gi-ees subside. Temjier is the disposi- 
tion which remains after these emotions 
are past, and which forms the habitual 
propensity of the soul. See\Dr. Evans's 
Practical Discourses on the Christian 
Temper; and the various articles, Love, 
Patience, Humility, Fortitude, 
&amp;G. in this work. 

TEMPERANCE, that virtue which 
a man is said to possess who moderates 
and restrains his sensual appetites. It 
is often, however, rsed in a much more 
general sense, as synonymous with mo- 



)79 



TEM 



deration, and is then applied indiscri 
minately to all the passions. 

" Temperance," says Addison, " has 
those particular advantages above all 
other means of health, that it may be 
practised by all ranks and conditions at 
any season or in any place. It is a kind 
of regimen into which every man may 
put himself without interruption to bu- 
siness, expense of money, or loss of 
time. Physic, for the most part, is 
nothing else but the substitute of exer- 
cise, or tem/ierance." In order to ob- 
tain and practice this virtue, we should 
considerit : 1. As a divine command, 
Phil. iv. 5. Luke xxi. 34. Prov. xxiii. 
1 — 3. — 2. As conducive to health. — 3. As 
advantageous to the powers of the mind. 
— 4. As a defence against injustice, lust, 
imprudence, detraction, poverty, Sec. 
— And, lastly, the example of 'Christ 
should be a most powerful stimulus to 
it. See Intemperanck, Sobriety. 

TEMPLARS, Templers, or 
KxiGHTs OF THE Temple, a rcligious 
order instituted at Jerusalem, in the be- 
ginning of the twelfth century, for the 
defence of the holy sepulchre, and the 
protection of Christian pilgrims. Tliey 
were first called The poor of the Holy 
City, and afterwards assumed the ap- 
pellation of Templars, because their 
house was near the temple. The or- 
der was fovmded by Baldwin II. then 
king of Jerusalem, with the concurrence 
of the poue : and the principal articles 
of their rule were, that they should 
hear the holy office throughout e\ ery 
day ; or that, when their milituiy du- 
ties should prevent this, they should 
supply it by a certain number of pa- 
ternosters ; that they should abstain 
from flesh four days in the week, and on 
Fridays from eggs and milk meats ; that 
each knight might have three horses 
and one squire, and that they shouUl 
neither hunt nor fowl. After the ruin 
of Jerusalem, about 1186, they spread 
themselves through Germany and other 
counti'ies of Euroj&gt;e, to which they wei-e 
invited by the liberality of the Chris- 
tians. In the year 122H this order ac- 
quired staiiility, by being confirmed in 
the council of Troyes, and subjected to 
a rule of discipline drawn up bv St. Ber- 
nard. In every nation thev had a par- 
ticular go\-ernor, called ^fa^;tcr of the 
Temple, or of the militia of the tehiple. 
Their grand master l.ad his residence 
at Paris. The order of Templars tlou- 
lished for some time, and acquired, by 
the valour of its knights, immense riches, 
and an eminent degree of military re- 
nown ; but, as their prosperity increas- 
ed, their \ices were mulliplicd, and

their arrogance, luxury, and cruelt)-, 
rose at last to such a great height, that 
their privileges were revoked, and their 
order suppressed with the most terrible 
circumstances of infamy and severity. 

TEMPI^E, a public building erected 
for the purpose of religious worship. 

TEMPORAL, a term often used for 
secular, as a distinction from spiritual or 
ecclesiastical; likewise for any thing be- 
longing to time in contrast with eternitv. 

TEMPORALITIES OF BIbHOPS 
are the revenues, lands, tenements, and 
lay fees belonging to bishops, as they 
are barons and lords of parliament. 

TEMPTATION, the enticement of 
a person to commit sin by offering some 
seeming advantage. There are four 
things, says one, in temptation : 1. De- 
ception.— 2. Infection.^3. Seduction. — 
4. Perdition. ■ The sources of tempta- 
tion, are Satan, the world, and the flesh. 
We are exposed to them in every state, 
in everv place, and in every time of 
life. They may be wisely permitted to 
show us our weakness, to try our faith, 
to promote our humility, and to learn us 
to place our dependence on a superior 
power : \-et we must not run into thcni, 
but watch and pi-ay ; avoid sinful com- 
panv : consider the love, sufferings, and 
constancy of Christ, and the awful Con- 
sequences of falling a victim to them. 
The following rules have been laid 
down, by which we may in some mea- 
sure know when a temptation comes 
from Satan. — 1. When the temptation is 
U'lnatural, or contrary to the general 
bias or temper of our minds. — 2. Wiien 
it is opposite to the present frame of the 
mind. — 3. When the temptation itself is 
irrational ; being contrary to whatever 
we could imagine our own minds would 
suggest to us. — 4. \Mien a temptation 
is detested in its first rising and appear- 
ance. — 5. Lastly, when it is violent. See

TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. 
The temptation of Christ, of which we 
fead in the 4th chap, of Matthew, has 
been much the subject of infidel ridi- 
cule, and some ingenious writers, to 
avoid the difficulties of a literal inter- 
pretation, have reduced the whole to 
vision and allegory. But perhaps this 
has increased rather than removed those 
difficulties. Is it not best always to ad- 
here as close as possible to the language 
of inspiration, without glossing it with 
fancies of our own .■' And, after all, what j 



is there so inconsistent with reason in 
this account ? That, when our Lord re- 
tired to the interior part of the wilder- 
ness, the enemy of mankind should as- 
sume a disguise (whether human or an- 
gelic is not important,) and present the 
most plausible temptation to our Re- 
deemer, under these trying circum- 
stances, is perfectly consistent with the 
malevolence of his character ; but how 
far he was permitted to exert his power 
in forming them, is not necessary to be 
inquired. The grand objection is, 
wliy was Satan suffered thus to insult 
the Son of God ? Wherefore did the 
Redeemer suffer his state of retirement 
to be thifs disturbed with the malicious 
suggestions of the fiend ? May it not be 
answered that herem, 1. He gave an in- 
stance of his own condescension and 
humiliation. — 2. He hereby proved his 
power over the tempter. — 3. He set an 
example of firmness and virtue to his 
followers. — And, 4. He here affords con- 
solation to his suffering people, by show- 
ing not only that he himself was tempt- 
ed, but. is able to succour those who are 
tempted, Heb. ii. 13. Heb. iv. 15. Far-

TERAPHIM, aword in the Hebrew 
language which has much exercised the 
ingenuity of the ci'itics. It is commonly 
interpreted idols. It would be useless 
here to trouble the reader with the nu- 
merous conjectures which have been 
formed respecting its meaning. Per- 
haps the best way to determine it would 
be to examine and compare all the pas- 
sages in wrticli it occurs, and to consult 
the 'ancient translations. 

TESTAMENT, OLD. See Bible,

TESTAMENT, NEW. The reh- 
gious institution of Jesus Christ, says 
Mr. Campbell, is frequently denomi- 
nated n KaivT) ^laSrixn, which is almost al- 
ways rendered the JVew Testatnent : 
yet the word SioStixh by itself, is generally 
translated covenant. It is the Greek 
word, whereby the Seventy have uni- 
formly translated the Hebrew word 
Berith, whichour translators have inva- 
riably translated 'covenant That the 
Hebi-ew term corresponds much better 
to the English word covenant than to 
testament, there can be no question ; 
yet the word SiaOrixn in classical use is 
more frequently rendered Testament. 
The proper Cireek word for covenant 
is ouvBtixh, which is not found in the New 
Testament, and occurs only thrice in the 
Se])tuagint, where it is never employed 
for rendering the word Berith. 



TES

THA 



The term New is added to distinguish 
it from the Old Covenant, that is, the 
dispensation of Moses. The two cove- 
nants are always in Scripture the two 
dispensations : that under Moses is the 
old, that under the Messiah is the new. 
In the latitude wherein the term is 
used in holy wi'it, the command under 
the sanction of death, which God gave 
to Adam, may, with sufficient propriety, 
be termed a Covenant ; but it is never 
so called in Scripture : and when men- 
tion is made of the two covenants, the 
old and the new, or the first and the se- 
cond, there appears to be no reference 
to any thing that related to Adam. In 
all such places, Moses and Jesus are 
contrasted, — the Jewish economy, and 
the Christian : mount Sinai, in Arabia, 
■where the law was promulgated ; and 
mount Sion in Jenisalem, where the 
Gospel was first published. 

These terms, trom signifying the two 
dispensations, came soon to denote the 
books wherein they were written, the 
sacred writings of the Jews being called 
the Old Testament ; and the writings 
superadded br the apostles and evange- 
lists, the New Testament. An exam- 
ple of the use of the former application 
we have in 2 Cor. iii. 14. " Until this 
day remaineth the veil untaken away 
in the reading of the Old Testament." 
See Dr. Campbell's Pract. Disstr. 
part 3. 

TEST ACT, is the statute 25 Car. 
II. cap. 2, which directs all officers, 
civil and military, to take the oaths, and 
make the declaration against traiisub- 
stantiation, in the Court of King's Bench 
or chancery, the next term, or at the 
next quarter sessions, or (by subsequent 
statutes) within six months after their 
admission ; and also within the same 
time to receive the sacrament of the 
Lord's supper, according to the usage of 
the church of England, m some public 
church, immediately after divine ser- 
vice or sermon, and to deliver into court 
a certificate thereof, signed by the mi- 
nister and church-warden : and also to 
prove the same by two credible wit- 
nesses, upon forfeiture of five hundred 
pounds, and disability to hold the said 
office. The avowed object of this act 
was, to exclude from places of trust all 
members of the church of Rome ; and 
hence the Dissenters of that age, if they 
did not support the bill when passing 
through the two houses of parliament, 
gave it no opposition. For this part of 
then' conduct they have been often cen- 
sui-ed with severity, as having betrayed 
their rights from resentment to their 
jenemies. | 



To make the ordinance of the Lord s 
supper a qualification of admittance to 
any office m or under the civil govern- 
ment, is evidently a profanation of the 
ordinance itself; not to insist upon the 
impropriety of excluding peaceable and 
loyal subjects from places of trust and 
profit, merely on account of their reli- 
gious opinions. Various tracts have been 
written on the subject of a repeal of this 
act by Priestly, Englefield, Walker, 
W^akefield, Bristow, Palmer, and others. 
On the contrary side, by a great num- 
ber of anonvmous writers. 

THANKFULNESS. See Grati- 
TUDK, and the next article. 

THANKSGIVING, that part of di- 
vine worship, wherein we acknowledge 
benefits received. " It implies," says 
Dr. Barrow, (vol. i. ser. 8 and 9.) " 1. A 
right apprehension of the benefits con- 
ferred. — 2. A faithful retention of bene- 
fits in the memory, and frequent reflec- 
tions upon them. — 3. A due esteem and 
valuation of benefits. — 4. A reception of 
those benefits with a willing mind, a ve- 
hement affi-'ction. — 5. Due acknowledg- 
ment of our obligations. — 6. Endeavours 
of real compensation ; or, as it respects 
the Divine Being, a willingness to serve 
and exalt him. — 7. Esteem, veneration, 
and love of the benefactor." The A/fss- 
ings for which we should be thankful 
are, 1. Temfioral; such as health, food, 
raiment, rest, &amp;c. — 2. Spiritual; such 
as the Bible, ordinances, the Gospel and 
its blessings ; as free grace, adoption, 
pardon, justification, calling, fvc- — 3. 
Kternal, or the enjoyment of God in a 
future state. — Also for all that is past, 
what we now enjoy, and what is pro- 
mised : for private and public, for ordi- 
nary, and extraordinary blessings ; for 
prosperity, and even ad\ ei'sity, so far as 
rendered subservient to our good. The 
excellency of this duty appears, if wc 
consider, 1. Its antiquity : it existed in 
Paradise before Adam fell, and there- 
fore prior to the graces of faith, re- 
pentance, &amp;c. — 2. Its sphere of opera- 
tion : being fur beyond many other graces 
which are confined to time and place. 
—3. Its felicity ; some duties are pain- 
ful ; as repentance, conflict with .sin, 
8cc. but this is a source of sublime 
pleasure. — 4. Its reasonableness. — And, 
5. Its perpetuity. This will be in exer- 
cise for evei-, when other graces will not 
be necessary, as faith, re5)entance, &amp;c. 
The 'obligation to this duty arises, 1. 
From the relation we stand in to God. 
— 2. The divine command.—- 3. The 
promises God hath made. — 4. The 
example of all good men. — 5. Our 
unworthiuess of the blessings we re-

THEFT, the taking awny the pro- 
perty of another without his knowledge 
or consent. This is not only a sin 
agamst our neighboui", but a direct vio- 
lation of that part of the decalogue, 
■which says, "Thou shalt not steal." 
Tliis Lyv requires justice, truth, and 
faithfulness in all our dealings with 
men; to owe no man any thing, but to 
give to all their dues ; to be true to all 
engagements, promises, and contracts ; 
and to be faithful in whatever is com- 
mitted to our care and trust. It for- 
bids all unjust ways of increasing our 
own and hurting our neighbour's sub- 
stance by using talse balances and mea- 
sures ; by over-reaching and circum- 
venting m trade and conimei-ce ; by 
taking away by force or fraud the goods, 
persons, and properties of men ; by bor- 
lowing and not paying again ; by op- 

ijression, extortion, and unlawful usujy. 
[t may include in it also, vvhat is very 
seldom called by this name, i. e. the 
rehiring of oursehes and families, by 
neglecting our callings, or impitident 
management thereof; lending larger 
stuns of money than our circumstances 
will bear, when there is no prosjject of 
payment ; by being profuse and exces- 
sive in our expenses ; Indulging inilaw- 
ful pleasures, and thtreby reducing our 
families to poverty ; or even, on the 
other hand, by laying tip a great deal 
for the time to come, while our families 
are left to starve, or reduced to the 
greatest inconvenience and distress. 

THEODOSIANS. See Angelites. 

THEOLOGY signifies that science 
which treats of the l)eing and attributes 
of God, his relations to us, the dispensa- 
tions of his providence, his will with re- 
spect to our actions, and his purposes 
with respect to our end. The word was 
first used to denote the systems, or ra- 
ther the heterogeneous fables, of those 
poets and i&gt;hilosophers who wrote of the 
genealogy and exploits of the gods of 
Greece. Hence Orpheus, Museus, 
Hesiod, 8cc. were called theologian's; 
and the same epithet was given to Plato, 
on account of his sublime speculations 
on the same subject. It was afterwards 
ado])ted by the earliest winters of the 
Christian Church, who styled the author 
of the Apocalypse, by way of eminence, 
$t;.-\ :7.1s, the divine. As the various 
branches of theology are considered in 
their places in this work, they need not 
be insisted on here. The theological 
student will find the following books on 
the subject of utility ; (jro/his de 
Veritate Reli^ioiiis Christians ; Stil-

THEOPASCHITES, a denomina- 
tion in the fifth century, who held that 
Christ had but one nature, which was 
the divine, and consequently that this 
divine nature suffered. 

THEOPHILANTHROPISTS, a 
sect of deists, who, in September 1796, 
published at Paris a sort of catechism or 
directory for social worship, under the 
title of Manuel des Theanthrojihiles. 
This religious breviary found favour; 
the congregation became numerous: 
and in tlte second edition of their Manual 
they assumed the less harsh denomina- 
tion of Theo/ihilanthropists, i. e. lovers 
of God and man. — According to them, 
the temple the most worthy of the Di- 
vinit\- is the universe. Abandoned 
sometimes under the vault of heaven to 
the contemplation of the beauties of na- 
ture, they render its Author the homage 
of adoration and gratitude. They ne- 
vertheless have temples erected by the 
hands of men, in which it is more com- 
modious for them to assemble, to hear 
lessons concerning his wisdom. Certain 
moral inscriptions ; a simple altar, on 
which they deposit, as a sign of grati- 
tude for the benefits of the Creator, 
such fiowers or fruits as the season af- 
ford ; a tribune for the lectures and dis- 
courses, form the whole of the orna- 
ments of their temples. 

The first inscription, placed ■ above 
the altar, recalls to remembrance the 
two religious dogmas which are the 
foundation of their moral. 

First insciiption. ^^'e believe in the 
existence of God, in the immortality of 
the soul. — Second inscription. Worship 
God, cherish your kind, render youi- 
selves useful to your country. — Third 
inscription. Good is every thing which 
tends to the preservation or the perfec- 
tion of man. E\il is every thing whicli 
tends to destroy or deteriorate him. — ■ 
Fourth inscription. Children, honour 
your fathers and mothers ; obey them 
with affection, comfort their old age. 
Fathers and mothers, instnict your 
children. — Fifth inscription. Wives, 
regard your husbands, the chiefs of 
your houses. Husbands, love your wives.

THE 



and render yourselves reciprocally 
happy. 

From the concluding part of the Ma- 
nuel of the Theophilanthropists, we may 
karn something more of their senti- 
ments. " If any one ask you," say they, 
" what is the origin of }-our religion aiid 
of your worship, you can answer him 
thus : Open the most ancient books 
which arc known, seek there what was 
the religion, what the worship of the 
first human beings of which history has 
preserved the remembrance. There 
you will see that their religion was what 
we now call natural religion, because it 
has for its principle even the Author of 
nature. It is he that has engraven it in 
the heart of the first human beings, in 
ours, in that of all the inhabitants of tlie 
earth ; this religion, which consists in 
worshipping God and cherishing oiu' 
kind, is wlmt we express by one single 
word, that of Theofihilanthro/iy. Thus 
our religion is that of our first parents ; 
it is youi's ; it is ours ; it is the uniAcrsal 
i-eligion. As to our worship, it is also 
that of our first fathers. See even in 
the most ancient writings, that the ex- 
tenor sigTis by which they rendered 
their homage to the Creator, were of 
great simplicity. Thej^ dressed for him 
an altar of earth ; they offered him, in 
sign of their gratitude and of theii* sub- 
mission, some of tlie productions which 
tliey held of his liberal hand. The fa- 
tliers exhorted their children to virtue ; 
they all encouraged one anothei", under 
the auspices of the Divinity, to the ac- 
complishment of their duties. This 
simple worship, the sages of all nations 
ha\e not ceased to profess, and they 
have transmitted it down to us without 
interruption. 

" If they yet ask you of whom you 
hold your mission, answer, we hold it 
of God himself, who, in giving us two 
arms to aid our kind, has also given us 
intelligence to mutually enlighten us, 
and the love of good to bring vis together 
to virtue ; of God, who has given expe- 
rience and wisdom to the aged to guide 
the young, and authority to fathers to 
conduct their children. 

" If they are not struck with the force 
of these reasons, do not farther discuss 
the subject, and do not eng ige yourself 
in controversies, which tend to diminish 
tiie love of our neighbo\u-s. Our prin- 
ciples are the Eternal Truth ; they will 
suDsist, whatever individuals mav sup- 
port or attack them, and the efiforts of 
tlie wicked will not even pre\'ail against 
them. Rest firmly attached to them, 
without attacking or defendnig any re- 
ligious system ; and remember, that si- 



milar discussions have never produced 
good, and that they have often tinged 
the earth with the blood of" men. Let 
us lay aside systems, and apply our- 
selves to doing good : it is the only road 
to happiness." So much for the di- 
vinity of the Theophilanthropists : a 
svstem entirely defective, because it 
wants the true foundation, — the word of 
God ; the grarid rule of all our actions, 
and the only basis on which our hopes 
and prospects of success can be built. 

THEOSOPtllSTS, a sect who pre- 
tend to derive all their knowledge from 
divine illumination. They boasf that, 
by means of this celestial light, they are 
not only admitted to the intimate know- 
ledge of God, and of all divine truth, 
but have access to the most sublime se- 
crets of nature. They ascribe it to the 
singidar manifestation' of divine bene- 
volence, that they are able to make 
such a use of the element of fire in the 
chemical art, as enables them to dis- 
cover the essential principles of bodies, 
and to disclose stupendous mysteries in 
the ph.vsical world. To this class, it is 
said, belonged Paracelsus, R. Fludd, 
Van Helmont, Peter Poiret, and the 
Rosicrusians. 

THER APEUTiE, so called from the 
extraordinaiy purity of their religious 
worship, were a Jewish sect, who, with 
a kind of religious frenzy, placed their 
whole felicity in the contemplation of tlie 
divine nature. Detaching themselves 
wholly from secular affairs, they trans- 
ferred their property to their relations 
or fi'iends, and withdrew into solitary 
places, where they devoted themselves 
to a holy life. Tlie principal society of 
this kind was formed near Alexandria, 
where they lived, not far from each 
other, in separate cottages, each of 
which had its own sacred apartment, to 
which the inhabitants I'etired for the 
purposes of devotion. After their 
moi-ning prayers, they spent the day ij^ 
studying the law and the prophets, en- 
deavouring, by the help of the commen- 
taries of their ancestors, to discove r some 
allegorical meaning in every part. Be- 
sides this, they entertained themselves 
with composing sacred hymns in various 
kinds of metre. Six days of the week 
were, in this manner, passed in solitude. 
On the seventh day they met, clothed 
in a decent habit, in a public assembly' ; 
where taking their places according tn 
their age, they sat with the right hand 
between the breast and the chin, and the 
left at the side. Then some one of tlip 
elders, stepping forth into the middle ot 
the assembly, discoursed with a grave: 
countenance anci a calm tone of voice.

on the doctrines of the sect ; the audi- 
ence, in the mean time, remaining in i 
perfect silence, and occasionally ex- : 
pressing their attention and ajjprobation 
by a nod. The chapel where they met 
was divided into two apartments, one 
for the men, and the other for the wo- 
men. So strict a regard was paid to si- 
lence in these assemblies, that no one 
Avas permitted to whisper, nor even to 
breathe aloud ; but when the discourse 
was finished, if the question which had 
been proposed for solution had been 
treated to the satisfaction of the audi- 
ence, they expressed their approbation 
by a murmur of applause. Then the 
speaker, rising, sung a hymn of praise 
to God ; in the last verse of which the 
whole assembly joined. On great fes- 
tivals, the meeting was closed with a 
vigil, in which sacred music was per- 
formed, accompanied with solemn dan- 
cing ; and these vigils wei*e continued till 
morning, when the assembly, after a 
morning prayei', in which their faces 
were directed towards the rising sun, 
was broken up. So abstemious were 
these ascetics, that they commonly ate 
nothing before the setting sun, and often 
fasted two or three days. They abstain- 
ed from wine, and their ordinary food 
was bread and herbs. 

Much dispute has arisen among the 
learned concerning this sect. Some 
have imagined them to have been Judai- 
zing Gentileg; but Philo supposes them 
to be Jews, by speaking of them as a 
branch of the sect of Essenes, and ex- 
pressly classes them among the follow- 
ers of Moses. Others have maintained, 
that the Therapeutae were an Alexan- 
drian sect of Jewish converts to the 
Christian faith, who devoted themselves 
to a monastic life. But this is impossi- 
ble ; for Philo, who wrote before Chris- 
tianity appeared in Egypt, speaks of this 
as an established sect. From com- 
paring Philo's account of this sect with 
the state of jjhilosophy in the country 
where it flourished, it seems likely that 
the Therapeutx were a body of Jewish 
fanatics, who sufliiu-ed themselves to be 
drawn aside from the simplicity of their 
ancient religion by the example of the 
Egyptians and Pythagoreans. How 
long this sect continued is uncertain ; 
but it is not improbable that, after the 
appearance of Christianity in Egypt, it 
soon became extinct. 

THOUGHT, an image of any thing 
formed in the mind ; sentiment, reflec- 
tion, opinion, design. As the thoughts 
are the prime movers of the conduct; 
as in the sight of the Divine Being, they 
bear the character of good or evil ; and 



as they are therefore cognizable at his 
tribunal ; the moral regulation of them 
is of the greatest importance. It is of 
consequence to inquire what thoughts 
ought to be rejected and Avhat to be in- 
didged. Those of an evil nature, which 
ought to be banished, are, 1. Fretful and 
discontented thoughts. — 2. x\nxious and 
apprehensive thoughts. — 3. Angry and 
wrathful thoughts. — 4. Malignant and 
revengeful thoughts. — 5. Siich as are 
foolish, trifling, and unreasonable. — 6. 
WWA and extravagant, \'ain and fantas- 
tical. — 7. Romantic and chimerical. — 8. 
Impure and lascivious. — 9. Gloomy and 
melancholy. — 10. Hasty and volatile. — 
11. Profane and blasphemous. The 
thoughts ive ought to indulge, are those 
which give the mind a rational or re- 
ligious pleasure ; tend to improve the 
understanding ; raise the affections to 
divine objects ; to promote the welfare 
"of our fellow creatui-es, and withal the 
divine glory. To bring the mind into 
a habit of thinking as we ought to think, 
there should by a constant dependence 
on and imploring of divme grace ; an 
increasing ac&lt;]uaintance with the sacred 
Scriptures; and improvement of every 
opportunity of serious conversation ; a 
constiuit observance of the works of 
God in creation, pi'ovidence, and grace ; 
and, lastly, a deep sense of the realities 
of an eternal world as revealed in the 
word of Ciod. Mason on Self-know- 
ledge; Watts on the Mind ; Goodwin's 
Vanity of Thoughts. See his Works, 
vol. iii. p. 232. 

TIARA, the name of the pope's 
triple crown. The tiara and keys are 
the badges of the papal dignity, the 
tiara of his civil rank, and the keys of 
his jurisdiction ; for as soon as the pope 
is dead, his arms are represented with 
the tiara alone, without the. keys. The 
ancient tiara was a round high cap. 
John XIII. first encompassed it with a 
crown. Boniface VIII. added a second 
crown ; and Benedict XII. a third. 

TIME, mode of duration marked by 
certain periods, chiefly by the motion 
and revolution of the sun. The ge- 
neral idea which time gives in every 
thing to which it is applied, is that ot* 
limited duration. Thus we cannot say 
of the Deity that he exists in time, be- 
cause eternity, which he inhabits, is ab- 
solutely uniform, neither admitting limi- 
tation nor succession. 

Time is said to be redeemed or im- 
proved when it is. properly filled up, or 
employed in the conscientious discharge 
of all the duties which devolve upon 
us, as it respects the Divine Being, our- 
selves, and our fellow-creatures. Time

may be said to be lost when it is not de- 
voted to some good, useful, or at least 
some mnocent pui-pose ; 6r when op- 
portunities of improvement, business, or 
devotion, are neglected. Time is wasted 
by excessive sleep, unnecessary recrea- 
tions, indolent habits, useless visits, idle 
reading, vain conversation, and all those 
actions which have no good end in 
them. We ought to improve the time, 
when we consider, 1. That it is short. 
— 2. Swift. — 3. Irrecoverable. — &lt;i. Un- 
certain. — 5. That it is a talent com- 
mitted to our trust. — And, 6. That the 
improvement of it is advantageous and 
interesting in every respect. See 
Shower on Time and Eternity; Fox on 
Time; J. Jichvards's Posthumous Ser- 
mons, ser. 24, 25, 26 ; Ha/e's Contem- 
filations, p. 211 ; Heii'ey's Medita- 
tions ; Younif's Jsi'ight Thoughts; 
Biair's Grave. 

TOLERATION, in matters of re- 
ligion, is either civil or ecclesiastical. 
Civil toleration is an impunity, and 
safely granted by the state to ever\" sect 
that does not maintain doctrines incon- 
sistent with the public peace. Ecclesi- 
astical toleration is the allowance which 
the church grants to its members to 
differ in cei'tain opinions not reputed es- 
sential. See Dr. Owen, Locke, and Dr. 
Furneaux, on Toleration; Alilton's Ci- 
vil Power in Ecclesiastical Causes;

ches; Rejlexions Philosohhifjues et Po- 
litiques sur la Tolerance Religieuse,pur

TOLERATION ACT, an act for 
exempting their Majesties' Protestant 
Subjects, dissenting from the Church of 
England, from the Penalties of certain 
Laws. 

The preamble states, " That foras-

Lord Sidmouth has lately attempt- 
ed to introduce a bill in the House of 
Lords, proposing some amendment or 
explanation of this famous Act, in order 
to prevent abuses ; but the fact appear- 
ed to be the prevention of Sectarianism 
by means of itinerant preachers ; and 
to clog the exertions of those who wish 
to instruct their neighbours. Vast num- 
ers of petitions from all parts of the 
country were presented against the bill ; 
so that when it was brought forward on 
May 21, 1811, (after a considerable dis- 
cussion,) the question for a second 
reading was put and negatived without 
a division. The bill was therefore 
thrown out. It is to be hoped that this 
-will be the last effort ever made to in- 
fi-inge the x\ct of Toleration.

TRADITION, something handed 
down from one generation to another. 
Thus the Jews pretended that, besides 
their written law contained in the Old 
Testament, Moses had delivered an oral 
law, which had been conveyed down 
from father to son ; and thus the Ro- 
man Catholics are s:ild to value par- 
ticular doctrines, supposed to have de- 
scended from the apostolic times by 
tradition. 

TRANSLATION, in the ecclesias- 
tical sense of tlie word, is the removing 
of a bishop from one see to another. It 
is also used for the \'ersion of a book or 
writing into a different language from 
that in which it was written. 

In translating- the Scrijitures, great 
knowledge and caution are necessary. 
Dr. ('lunpbell lays down three funda- 
mental rules for translating: 1. The 
translation should give a complete trans- 
cript of the ideas of the original.— 2. 
The style and manner of the original 
should be preserved. — 3. The transla- 
tion should have all the ease of original 
composition. He observes that the-dif- 
ficulties found in iranslating the Scrip- 
tures arise, 1. From the singularity of 
Jewish customs. — 2. From the povei'ty 
(as appears) of their native language. — 
3. From the fewness of the books ex- 
tant in it. — 4. From the symbolical style 
of the prophets. — 5. From the excessive 
influence which a previous acquaintance 
with translations have occasioned. — 
And, 6. From pre-posscssions, in what 
way soever acquired, in regard to re- 
ligious tenets. 

Notwithstanding these di.'Ticultieg, 
however, the divines employed bv King 
James to translate the Old and New- 
Testaments, ha\ e given us a translation 
which, with a very few exceptions, can 
scarcely be improved. 'I'hcse divines 
were profoundly skilled in the learaing 
as well as in the languages of the East ; 
whilst some of those whp have presumed 
to improve their version, seem not to 
have possessed a critical knowledge ot

the Greek tongue, to have known still 
less of the Hebrew, and to have been 
absolute strangers to the dialect spoken 
in Judea in the days of our Saviour, as 
well as to the manners, customs, and 
peculiar opinions of the Jewish sects. 
'* Neither, as one observes, " meta- 
physical acuteness, nor the most perfect 
knowledge of the principles of transla- 
tion in general, will enable a man who 
is ignorant of these things to improve 
the authorised version either of the Gos- 
pels or Epistles, for such a man knows 
not accurately, and therefore cannot 
give a complete transcript of the ideas 
of the original work." See Bible; 
Mr. Tytler's Essay on the Principles 
of Translation ; and Dr. Camfibell's 
Preliminary Dissertations to his transla- 
tion of the Gosfiels. 

TRANSUBSTANTIATION, the 
conversion or change of the substance 
of the bread and wine in tlie eucharist 
into the body and blood of Jesus Christ, 
which the Romish church suppose to be 
wrought by the consecration of tlie 
priest. Nothing can be more contra- 
dictory to Scripture, or to common 
sense, than this doctrine. It must be 
evident to every one who is not blinded 
by ignorance and prejudice, that oui- 
Lord's words, " This is my bod}," are 
mere figurative expressions; besides, 
such a transubstantiation is so oppo- 
site to the testimony of our senses, as 
completely to undermine the whole 
proof of all the miracles by which Gtxl 
iiath confirmed revelation. According 
to such a transubstantiation, the same 
body is alive and dead at once, ai^d may 
he in a million of different places whole 
and -entire at the same instant of time; 
accidents remain without a substance, 
and substance without accidents; and 
that a part of Christ's body is equal to 
the whole. It is also contrary to the 
end of the sacrament, which is to re- 
present and commemorate Christ, not 
to believe that he is coiporeally present, 
1 Cor. ix. 24, 25. But we need not 
waste time in attemptijig to refute a 
doctrine which by its impious conse- 
quences refutes itself. See Smith's Er- 
rors of the Church of Rome, dial. '6;

TRENT, Council of, denotes the 
council assembled by Paul III. in 1545, 
and continued by twenty-five sessions 
till the year 1563, under Julius III. 
and Pius IV. in order to correct, illus- 
trate, and fix with perspicuity, the doc- 
trine of the church, to restirt the vi- 
gour of its discipline, and to reform the i 



lives of its ministers. The decrees of 
this council, together with the creed of 
pope Pius IV. contain a sumniary of the 
doctrines of the Roman Catholics. See 
Mosheim's. Church History; The Mo- 
dern Universal History, \o\. 23; Pra. 
Paolo Sar/ii's, and Father Paul's His- 
tories of the Council of Trent. 

TRIERS, a society of ministers, with 
some others, chosen by Cromwell to sit 
at Whitehall. They were mostly In- 
dependents, though some Presbyterians 
were joined with them. They had 
power to try all that came for mstitu- 
tion and induction; and without their 
approbation none were admitted. They 
examined all who were able to come up 
to London ; but if any were unable, or 
of doubtful qualifications, thej' referred 
them to some ministers in the county 
where they lived. They rejected all 
those who did not live according to their 
profession, and placed in their room able 
serious preachers who lived godly lives, 
though of different opinions. 

TRINITARIANS, those who believe 
in the Trinity. See next article, and 
the 162d Lee. of Doddridge, where the 
reader will find a statement of the opi- 
nions of the ancients on this doctrine, as 
likewise many of the TTTodenis ; such as 
Baxter, Dr. Clarke, Burnet, Howe, Wa- 
terland, Taylor, Pearson, Bull, Wallis, 
Watts, and Jeremy Taylor. 

TRINITY, the union of three in one ; 
generally applied to the ineffable mys- 
tery of three persons in one God, — Fa- 
ther, Son, and Holy Spirit. This doc- 
trine is rejected by many because it is 
incompi'ehensible ; but, as Mr. Scott 
observes, if distinct personality, agency, 
and divine perfections, be in Scnpture 
ascribed to the Father, and to the Son, 
tuid to the Holy Spirit, no words can 
more exactly express the doctrine, 
which must unavoidably be thence in- 
ferred, than those commonly used on 
this subject, viz. that there are three 
distinct Pereons in the Unity, of the 
Godhead. The sacred oracles most as- 
suredly teach us, that the One living 
and true God is, in some inexplicable 
manner. Triune, for he is spoken of, as 
One in some respects, and as Three in 
others. Gen. i. 26, Gen. ii. 6, 7. Is. xlviii. 
16. Is. xxxiv. 16. 2 Cor. xiii. 14. John 
xiv. 23. Matt, xxviii. 19. 2 Thess. hi. 3. 
1 John V. 7. Acts, v. 3, 4. The Trinity 
of Persons in the Dietv consists with 
the Unity of the Divine Essence ; though 
we pretend not to explain the modus of

is a secret to the most leanied natural- 
ists to this present day, and probably 
will always continue so. But if the 
most common of God's works, with 
wiiich we are the most conversant, be 
in this respect incomprehensible, how 
can men thmk that the modus existendi 
(or manner of existence) of the mfinite 
Creator can be level to their capacities ? 
— The doctrine of the Ti'inity is indeed 
a mystery, but :io man hath yet shown 
that it involves in it a I'eal contradiction. 
Many have ventured to say, that it 
ought to be ranked with transubstan- 
tiation, as equally absurd. But Arch- 
bishop Tillotson has shown, by the 
most convincing arguments imaginable, 
that transubstantiation includes the 
most palpable contradictions ; and that 
we have the evidence of our eyes, feel- 
ing, and taste, that what we receive in 
the Lord's supper is bread, and not the 
body of a 7nan; whereas we have the 
testimony of our eyes alone, that the 
words " This is my body," are at all in 
the Scriptures. Now this is intelligible 
to the meanest capacit}' : it is fairly made 
out, and perfectly unanswerable : but 
who ever attempted thus to prove the 
doctrine of the Trinity to be self-con- 
tradictory .'' What testimony of our 
senses, or what demonstrated truth, 
does it contradict.-* \'et till this be 
shown, it is neither fair nor convincing, 
to exclaim against it as contradictory, 
absurd, and irrational." See articles 
Jesus Christ and Holy Ghost; also

cett, A. Taylor, J. Scott, Simfison, and

play of the Trinity by a Layman;

TRITHEISTS, a sect of the sixth 
century, whose chief was John Ascu- 
nage, a Syrian philosopher, and at the 
same time a Monophysite. This man 
imagined in the Deity three natures or 
substances absolutely equal in all re- 
spects, and joined together by no com- 
mon essence; to which opinion his ad- 
\ ersaries gav"e the name of Tritheism. 
One of the warmest defenders of this 
doctrine was John Philoponus, an Alex- 
andrian philosopher and grammarian of 
the highest reputation ; and hence he 
has been considered by many as the 
author of this sect, whose members 
liave consequently derived from him 
the title of Philoponists. 

This sect was divided into two par- 
ties, the Philoponists and the Cononites ; 
the latter of whom were so called from 
Conon, bishop of Tarsus, their chief. 



They agi'eeed in the doctrine of three 
persons in the Godhead, and differed 
oniy in their manner of explaining what 
the Scriptures taught concerning the 
resurrection of the body. Philoponus 
maintained, that the /b?v« as well as the 
matter of all bodies was generated, and 
corrupted, and that both, therefore, 
were to be restored in the resurrection. 
j Conon held, on the contrar|L that the 
body never lost its form; that its matter 
alone was subject to corruption and de- 
cay, and was consequently to be re- 
stored when this mortal shall fiut on 
immortality. 

TRUCE OF GOD, a scheme set on 
foot for the purpose of quelhng the vio- 
lence and preventing the frequency of 
private wars, occasioned by the fierce 
spirit of the barbarians in the middle 
ages. In France, a general peace and 
cessation from hostilities took place 
A. D. 1032, and continued for seven 
years, in consequence of the methods 
which the bishop of Aquataine success- 
fully employed to work upon the super- 
stition ot the times. A resolution Avas 
formed, that no man should, in time to 
come, attack or molest his adversaries 
during the seasons set apart for cele- 
brating the great festivals of the church, 
or from the evening of Thursday in 
each week to the morning of Monday in 
the week ensuing, the intervening days 
being consecrated as particularly holy; 
our Lord's passion having happened on 
one of those days, and his resurrection 
on another. A change in the disposi- 
tions of men se sudden, and which pro- 
posed a resolution so unexpected, was 
considered as miraculous ; and the res- 
pite from hostilities which followed 
upon it was called the Truce of God. 
This cessation from hostilities during 
three complete days every week, allow- 
ed a considerable space for the passions . 
of the antagonists to cool, and for the 
people to enjoy a respite from the cala- 
mities of war, and to take measures for 
their own securitv. 

TRUST IN GOD, signifies that con- 
fidence in, or dependence we place on 
him. This trust ought to be, 1. Sin- 
cere and unreserved, not in idols, in 
men, in talents, riches, power, in our- 
selves part, and him part, Prov. iii. 5, 
6. — 2. Universal ; bodv, soul, circum- 
stances, 1 Peter v. 7. — 3. Perpetual, Is. 
xxvi. 4. — 4-. With a lively expectation of 
his blessing, Mic. vii. ": The encourage- 
7nent we have to trust in him arises, 
1. From his liberality, Rom. viii. 32. 
Ps. Ixxxiv. 11. — 2. His ability, James i. 
ir. — 3. His relationshi]), Ps. cfii. 13. — 
4. His promise, Isa. xxxiii. 16.— 5. His

conduct in all ages to those who have 
trusted him, Gen. xlviii. 15, 16. Ps. 
xxxvii. 25. The ha/i/iincss of those 
who trust in him is great, if we consi- 
der, 1. Their safety, Ps. cxxv. 1. — 2. 
Their courage, Ps. xxvii. 1. — 3. Their 
peace, Isa. xxvi. 3. — 4. Their character 
and fruitfulness, Ps. i. 3. — 5. Their end, 
Ps. xxxviL 37. Job v. 26. 

TRUTnH, a term used in opposition to 
falsehood, and applied to propositions 
which answer or accord to the nature 
and reality of the thing whereof some- 
thing is affirmed or denied. Natural or 
physical truth is said to be the agree- 
ment of our sentiments with the nature 
of things. Moral truth is the confor- 
mity of our words and actions to our 
sentiments. Evangelical or Gospel 
truth is taken for Christ ; the doctrines 
of the Gospel ; substance or reality, in 
opposition to the shadows and ceremo- 
nies of the law, John i. IT. For this 
truth we ought to be sincere in seeking, 
zealous in defending, and active in pro- 
pagating; highly to prize it, constantly 
to rejoice in it, and uniformly to be obe- 
dient to it. See Lying, Sincerity; 
Tatham's Scale of Truth; Locke on 
the Understanding; Beattie on Truth; 
Dr. St en net's Sermon on /iro/iagating 
the Truth; Saurin's Sermojis, Eng. 
ti'ans. vol. ii. ser. 1. and 14. 

TURLUPINS, a denomination which 
appeared about the year 1372, princi- 
]3ally in Savoy and Dauphiny. They 
taught that when a man is arrived at a 
certain state of perfection, he is freed 
from all subjection to the divine law. It 
is said, they often went naked, and they 
allowed of no prayer to God but men- 
tal. They called themselves the fra- 
ternity of the floor. 

TYPE, an impression, image, or re- 
presentation of some model, which is 
termed the antitype. In this sense we 
fften use the word to denote the pre- 



figuration of the great events of man's 
redemption by persons or things in the 
Old Testament. Types are distinguish- 
ed into, 1. Such as were directly ap- 
pointed for that end ; as the sacrifices. 
— 2. Such as had only a providential or- 
dination to that end ; as the story of Ja- 
cob and Esau. — And 3. Things that fell 
out of old, so as to illustrate present 
things from a similitude between them ; 
as the allegory of Hagar and Sarah. 
Some distinguish them into real and per- 
sonal ; by the former intending the ta- 
bernacles, temples, and religious insti- 
tutions ; and under the latter, including 
what are called providential and per- 
sonal types. While we may justly con- 
sider the death of Christ, and his resur- 
rection from the dead, as events that 
are typified in the Old Testament, we 
should be careful not to consider every 
thing mentioned in the Hebrew Scrip- 
tm'e as a type, for this will expose the 
whole doctrine of types to ridicule : for in- 
stance, what can be a greater bui'lesque 
on the Scriptures to suppose, as some 
have done, that the extraction of Eve 
from the side of Adam, while he was in 
a deep sleep, was intended as a type of 
the Roman soldiers' piercing our Sa- 
viour's side while he slept the sleep of 
death i* Such ideas as these, vented some- 
times by novices, and sometimes by more 
aged divines, give a greater proof of 
the wildness of their fancies than the 
correctness of their judgments. See 
IMather and M^Ewen on the Types; 
Ridifley's Div. quest. 35. 

TYTHE, the tenth part of all fruits, 
See. a revenue payable to the clergy. 
The tythes among the Jews were of three 
soi'ts. The first to the Levites, for their 
maintenance. Numb, xviii. 21. — 24. The 
second for the feasts and sacrifices, 
Deut. xiv. 22 ; and the third for the 
poor every thii'd year. Deut. xiv. 28, 
29. See Sufip. Papers.

VALENTINIANS, a sect who 
spining up in the second centurv, and 
were so called from their leader Valen- 
tinus. The Valentinians were only a 
branch of the Gnostics, who realized or 
personified the Platonic ideas concern- 
mg the Deity, whom they called Plero- 
nia, or Plenitude. Their system was 
this : the first principle is Bythos, i. e. 
Depth, which remained many ages un- 
known, haviiig with it Ennoe or Thought, 



and Siege or Silence : from these spnmg 
the Nous or Intelligence, which is the 
only Son, equal to and alone capable of 
comprehending the Bythos. The sister 
of Nous they called Alethcia or Truth ; 
and these constituted the first quatemi- 
ty of j^Eons, which were the source and 
original of all the rest ; for Nous and 
Aletheia produced the world and life, 
and from these two proceeded man and 
the church. But, besides these eight 



VAT 



591 



UBI 



pi-incipal ^ons there were twenty-two 
more ; the last of which, called Sofihia, 
being desirous to arrive at the know- 
ledge of Bythos, ga^■e herself a great 
deal of uneasiness, which created'in her 
Anger and Fear, of which was born 
Matter. But the Horos or Bounder 
stopped her, preserved her in the Ple- 
roma, and restofed her to perfection. 
Sopliia then produced the Christ and 
the Holy Spirit, which brought the ^ons 
to their last perfection, and made every 
one of them contribute their utmost to 
form a Saviour. Her Enthymcse or 
Thought, dwelling near the Pleroma, 
perfected by the Christ, produced every 
thing that is in this world by its divers 
passions. The Christ sent into it the 
Saviour, accompanied with angels, who 
delivered it from its passions without 
annihilating it : from thence was formed 
corporeal matter. And in this manner 
did they romance concerning God, na- 
ture, and the mysteries of the Christian 
religion. 

VATICAN MANUSCRIPT, one of 
the principal Greek manuscripts now 
extant. It contained originally the whole 
Greek Bible. The age of this manu- 
script is supposed to be no higher than 
the fifth century. See No. 29, article 

BlBLK. 

VANITY, emptiness. It is often ap- 
plied to the man who wishes you to think 
more highly of him than what he really 
deserves ; hence the vain man flatters 
in order to be flattered ; is always fond 
of praise, endeavours to bribe others 
into a good opinion of himself by his 
complaisance, and sometimes even by 
good offices, though often displayed with 
unnecessary ostentation. The term is 
likewise applied to this world, as unsa- 
tisfactory, Ecc. i. 2 ; to lying, Ps. iv. 2 ; 
to idols,' Deut. xxxii. 21; to whatever 
disappoints our hopes, Ps. Ix. 11. See 
Pridk. 

UBIQUITARIANS, formed from 
tibique, " every where," in ecclesiasti- 
cal history, a sect of Lutherans which 
rose and spread itself in Germany ; and 
whose distinguishing doctrine was, that 
the bod)" of Jesus Christ is every where, 
or in eveiy place. 

Brentius, one of the earliest reformers, 
is said to have fii'st broached this error 
in 1560. Luther himself, in his contro- 
versy with Zuingliiis, had thrown out 
some unguarded expressions that seem- 
ed to imply a belief of the onuiipresence 
of the body of Christ; but he became 
sensible afterwards tliat this opinion was 
attended with great difficulties, and par- 
ticularly that it ought not to be made 
use of as a proof of Christ's corporeal 



presence in the eucharist. However, 
after the death of Luther, this absurd 
hypothesis was renewed, and dressed up 
in a specious and plausible form by 
Brentius, Chemnitius, and Andrxas, 
who maintained the communication of 
the properties of Christ's divinity to his 
human nature. It is, indeed, obvious, 
that every Lutheran who believes the 
doctrine of consubstantiation, whatever 
he may pretend, must be an Ubiquita- 
rian. 

UBIQUITY, omnipresence; an at- 
tribute of the Diety, whereby he is al- 
ways intimately present to all things. 
See Omnisciexck. 

UCKEWALLISTS, a sect which 
derived its denomination from Uke- 
Walles, a native of Friesland, who pub- 
lished his sentiments in 1637. He en- 
tertained a favourable opinion of the 
eternal state of Judas and the rest of 
Christ's murderers. His argument was 
this, that the period of time which ex- 
tended from the birth of Christ to the 
descent of the Holy Ghost was a time of 
deep ignorance, during which the Jews 
were destitute of divine light ; and 
that, of consequence, the sins and enor- 
mities wliich were conmiitted during 
this interval were in a great measui-e 
excusable, and could not merit the se- 
verest displays of the divine justice. 
This denomination strictly adhered to 
the doctrine of the Mennonites. 

VEDAS, the sacred books of the Hin- 
doos, believed to be revealed by God, 
and called immortal. They are consi- 
dered as the fountain of all knowledge, 
human and divine, and are four in num- 
ber. The principal part of them is that 
which explains the duties of man in me- 
thodical arrangement. The fourth book 
contains a system of divine ordinances. 
See the Jirst volume of the Asiatic Re- 
searches. 

VENERATION, an affection com- 
pounded of awe and love, and which of 
all others becomes creatures to bear to- 
ward their infinitely perfect Creator. 
See Devotion. 

VERACITY OF GOD, is his tnith, 
or an exact correspondence and con- 
formity between his word and his mind. 
Moses says, " He is a God of ti-uth." 
He is true in and of himself; he truly 
and really exists ; he is the true and 
living GoH : all his perfections are true 
and real ; ti^uth is essential to him ; it is 
pure and perfect in him ; it is the first 
and original in him ; he is the fountain 
of tinith : all his works in creation, pro- 
vidence, and grace, are according to 
truth. See Faithfulness of God. 

VERSCHORISTS, a sect that de 



VIC 



592 



UNB 



rived its denomination from Jacob Ver- 
schoor, H native of Flushing, who in the 
year 16b0, out of a perverse and hetero- 
geneous mixture of the tenets of C-oc- 
ceius and Spinosa produced a new form 
of religion, equally remarkable for its 
extravagance and imp.ety. His disci- 
ples and followers were called Hebrews, 
on account of the zeal and assiduity 
with which they ail, without distinction 
of age or sex, applied themselves to the 
study of the Hebrew language. Their 
seiitnnents were nearly the same as the 
Hatcemists. See Hattemists. 

VICAR, a priest of a parish, the pre- 
dial tythes whereof are impr'.ipriate or 
appropriated ; that is, belong either to a 
chapter, rehgious house, Sec. or to a lay- 
man, who receives them, and onl\' al- 
lows the vicar the small tythes, or a 
convenient salary. 

VICE, a fault ; the opposite to virtue. 

VlCriL, the eve or day before anv so- 
lenui feast, because then Christians were 
wont to watch, fast and pray in their 
churches. 

VIRTUE, a term used in various sig- 
nifications. Some define it to be " living 
according to nature ;" others, " univer- 
sal benevolence to being." Some, again, 
place it " in regard to truth ;" others in 
" the moral sense." Some place it in 
" the imitation of God ;" others, " in 
the love of God and our fellow-crea- 
tures." Some, again, think it consists 
"in mediocrity," supposing vice to con- 
sist in extremes; others have placed it 
in " a wise regard to our own interest." 
Dr. Smith refers it to the principle of 
sympathy ; and Paley defines it to be 
the doing good to mankind, in obedi- 
ence to the will of God, and for the 
sake of everlasting happiness. Some of 
these definitions are certainly objection- 
able. Perhaps those who place it in 
the love of God and our fellow-crea- 
tureS, may come as near to the truth as 
any. See Kdivards and Jameson on Vir- 
tue ; Grove's and Falei/s Moral Phil. 
Cumberland's Law of Kuture, cap. 1. 
\ 4; Beat tie's Elements of Moral Sci- 
ence, vol. ii. p. 8, 77 ; Dr. Watts' Self- 
Love and Virtue Reconciled, 2d vol. of 
his work, last edition. 

VISION, the supernatural represen- 
tation on an object to a man when waking, 
as in a glass which places the visage be- 
fore him. It was one of the ways in 
which the Almighty was pleased to re- 
veal himself to the prophets. Is. i. 1. Is. 
xxi. 2. 

VISITATION, the survey or inspec- 
tion performed by a bishop in his dio- 
cess, to examine into the state of the 
church. In a divine or spiritual sense, 



it is taken either for a communication of 
divine love, or for any calamity affecting 
a nation. 

UNBELIEF, the refusing assent to 
testimony, it is often taken for distrust 
of God's faithfulness, but more parti- 
cularly for the discrediting the testimo- 
ny of God's word concerning his Son, 
John iii. 18, 19. John xvi. 9. "It in- 
cludes," says Dr. Guise, " disaffec- 
tion to God, disregard to his word, pre- 
judices against the Redeemer, readiness 
to give credit to any other than him, in- 
ordinate love to the world, and prefer- 
ring of the applause of men to tne ap- 
probation of God." — " Unbelief," says 
the great Charnock, " is the greatest 
sin, as it is the fountain of all sin : it was 
Adam's first sin ; it is a sin against the 
Gospel, against the highest testimony; 
a refusal to accept of Christ upon the 
terms of the Gospel. It strikes pecu- 
liarly at God ; is the greatest reproach 
of him, robs him of his glory, a contra- 
diction to his will, and a contempt of his 
authority." The causes of unbelief are 
Satan, ignorance, pride, and sensuality. 
The danger of it is great ; it hardens the 
heart, fills with presumption, creates 
impatience, deceives with error, and 
finally exposes to condemnation, John 
iii. 11. Churnock's Works, vol. ii. p. 
601 ; Case's Sermons, ser. 2 ; Bishop. 
Porteus's Sermons, vol. i. ser. 2 ; Dr. 
Owen's Reasons of Faith ; Hajinam's 
Compendium, vol. ii. p. 26 ; Churchill's 
Lssay on Unbelief. 

UNBELIEVERS are of three sorts. 
1. Those who, having heard the Gos- 
pel, reject it. — 2. Those who verbally 
assent to it, yet know not to what they 
assent, or why they believe. — 3. They 
who, whatever knowledge they may 
have of certain speculative points of di- 
vinity, yet obey not the truth, but live 
in sin. 

The following is a striking descrip- 
tion given by Masilon of an unbeliever 
(Ser. i. vol. iii. Eng. trans.) " He is a 
man without morals, probity, faith, or 
character; who owns no rule but his 
passions, no law but his iniquitous 
thoughts, no master but his desires, no 
check but the dread of authoritj', no 
God but himself; an unnatural child; 
since he believes that chance alone hath 
given him fa,thers; a faithless friend, 
seeing he looks upon men merely as the 
wretched fruits of a wJld and fortuitous 
concurrence to whom he is connected 
only by transitorj' ties : a cruel master, 
seeing he is convinced that the strong- 
est and the most fortunate have always 
reason on their side. Who could hence- 
forth place any dependence on such r"

They no longer fear a God ; they no 
longer respect men ; they look forward 
to nothmg after this life : virtue and 
vice are merely prejudices of education 
in their eyes, and the consequences of 
popular credulity. Adulteries, revenge, 
blasphemies, the blackest treacheries, 
abominations which we dare not even 
name, are no longer in their opinion but 
human. prohibitions established through 
the policy of legislators. According to 
them, the most horrible crimes or the 
purest virtues are all equally the same, 
since an eternal annihilation shall soon 
equalise the just and the impious,* and 
for ever confound them both in the 
dreary mansion of the tomb. What 
monsters, then, must such be upon the 
earth !" 

UNCHANGEAB5.ENESS OF 
GOD. See Faithfulness and iMiftu-' 
TABiLiTY OF God. 

UNCTION, in matters of religion, is 
used for the character conferred on sa- 
cred things by anointing them with oil. 
Unctions were very frequent among the 
Hebrews. They anointed both their 
kings and high priests at the ceremony 
of their inauguration. They also anoint- 
ed the sacred vessels of the tabernacle 
and temple, to sanctify and consecrate 
them to the service of God. In the an- 
cient Christian church, unction accom- 
panied the ceremonies of baptism and 
confirmation. Extreme unction, or the 
anointing persons in the article of death, 
was also practised by the ancient Cliris- 
tiahs, in compliance with the precept of 
St. James, chap. v. 14, 15 ; and this ex- 
treme unction the Romish church has 
advanced to the dignity of a sacrament. 
It is administered to none but such as 
are affected with some mortal disease, 
or in a decrepit age. It is refused to im- 
penitent persons, as also to criminals. 
The parts to be anointed are, the eyes, 
the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the 
hands, the feet, and the reins. The 
laity are anointed in the palms of the 
hands, but priests on the back of it, be- 
cause the palms of their hands have 
been already consecrated by ordination. 

The oil with which the sick person is 
anointed, represents, it is said, the 
grace' of God, which is poured down 
into the soul; and the prayer used at 
the time of anointing, expresses the re- 
mission of sins thereby granted to the 
sick, person : for the prayer is tWs-^" By 
this holy unction, and his own most pious 
mercy, may the Almighty God forgive 
thee whatever sins thou hast committed 
by the sight" when the eyes are anohit- 
ed ; by the hearing, when the ears are 
anointed : and so of the other senses. 



The passage before-mentioned fi-om 
St. James respecting the anointing with 
oil, has been a source of difficulty to some 
pious minds; but in order to under- 
stand it, it is necessary to obsei'\'e that 
anointing with oil was an ordinance for 
the miraculous cure of sick persons 
(Mark vi. 13.) But since those extra- 
ordinary gifts are ceased, as being no 
longer necessary for the confirmation of 
the Gospel, of course there is no war- 
rant now for using that ceremony. 

UNDERSTANDING, the faculty of 
perceiving thuigs distinctly ; or that 
power of the mind by which we arrive 
at a proper idea or judgment of things. 
See JUDGMENT, Mind, Soul. 

UNIFORMITY, regularity; a simi- 
litude or resemblance between the parts 
of a whole. The word is particularly 
used for one and the same form of pub- 
lic prayers, administi-ation of sacra- 
ments, and other rites, Sec. of the church 
of England, prescribed by the famous 
Stat. 1 Eliz. and 13, 14, Carol II. cap. 4. 
called the Act of Uniformity. 

UNION TO CHRIST, that act of 
divine grace by which we are joined to 
Christ ; and is considered, 1. Asvirtual, 
or that which was formed from all eter- 
nity, Eph. i. 4. — 2. Fital, or spiritual, 
foniied in the moment of our regenera- 
tion, John xvii. 26, 1 John iv. 13. It is 
represented in the Scripture by the 
strongest expressions language can ad- 
mit of, and even compared to the union 
between the Father and the Son, John 
xvii. 11,' 21, &amp;c. It is also compared to 
the union of a vine and its branches, 
John XV. 4, 5. To the union of our food 
with our bodies, John vi. 56, 57. ' To 
the union of the body with the head, 
Eph. iv. 15, 16. To the conjugal union, 
Eph. V. 23, 30. To the union of a king 
and his subjects, Matt', xxv. 34, 40. To 
a building, 1 Pet. ii. 4, 5. Eph. ii. 21, 
22. It is also represented by an identity 
or sameness of spirit, 1 Coi*. vi. 17. By 
an identity of body, 1 Cor. xii. 12, 2T. 
By an identity of interest. Matt, xxv, 
40. John XX. 17. This union must be 
considered not as a mere mental union 
only in comfort or notion j nor a jihysi- 
cal union as between the head and the 
members ; nor as an essential union, or 
union with the divine nature ; biif as a 
mystical union, Eph. v. 32. Honourable 
union, 1 John iu. 1, 2. Supernatural 
union, 1 Cor. i. 30. Holy, 1 John iii.' 
24. Necessary, John xv. 4. In\iola- 
ble, Rom. Viii. 38, 39. Some state it 
thus : 1. An union of natures, Heb. ii. 
11. — 2. Of actions, his obedience being 
imputed to us, and our sins reckoned to 
hitn, 2 Cor. v. 21.— 3. Of life. Col. iii. 4.—

UNION HYPOSTATICAL, is the 
union of the human nature of Christ 
with the divine, constituting two natures 
in one person. Not consuostantially, as 
the three persons in the Godhead ; nor 
physically, as soul and body united in 
one person : nor mystically, as is be- 
tween Christ and believers ; but so as 
that the manhood subsists in the second 
person, yet without making co?ifusion, 
t)oth making but one person. It was 
miraculous, Luke i. 34, 55. Complete 
and real : Christ took a real human body 
and soul, and not in appearance. Insc- 
Jiarahle, Heb. vii. 2.5. For the reasons 
of this union, see article Mediator. 

UNITARIANS, those who confine 
the glory and attributes of divinity to the 
Father, and not allowing it to the son or 
Holy Spirit. They are the same as the 
Socinians. See Socixians. 

UNITED BRETHREN. See Mo-

UNITY OF GOD, a term made use 
of to denote that there is but one God or 
self-eodstent Being. The unity of God 
is argued from his necessary existence, 
self-sufficiency, perfection, indepen- 
dence, and omnipotence ; from the 
unity of design in the works of nature ; 
and from there being no necessity of 
having more gods than one : but the 
Scriptures set it beyond aU doubt, Deut. 
vi. 4. Psalm Ixxxvi. 10. Isa. xliii. 10. 
Mark xii. 29. John xvii. 3. Rom. iii.

UNIVERSALISTS, those who sup- 
pose that, as Christ died for all, so, be- 
lore he shall have, delivered up his 



mediatorial kingdom to the Father, all 
shall be brought to a participation of 
the benefits ot his death, in their resto- 
ration to holiness and happiness. They 
teach, that the Avicked will receive a 
punishment apportioned to their crimes; 
that punishment itself is a mediatorial 
work, and founded upon mercy ; that it 
is a mean of humbling, subduing, and 
finally reconciling the sinner to God. 
They suppose that the words eternal, 
everlasting, &amp;c. as they sometimes apply 
to the things which have ended, so they 
cannot apply to endless misery. They 
say, this doctrine is tiie most consonant 
to' the perfections of the Deity, most 
worthv of the character of Christ, and 
that the Scriptures cannot be i-ecoh- 
ciled upon any other plan. They teach 
their followers ai\lent love to God ; and 
peeTce, meekness, candour, and univer- 
sal love to men, the}- observe, are the 
natural result of these views. 

The sentiments of the Universalists 
were embraced by Origen in the 3d cen- 
tury, and in more modern times by Che- 
valier Ramsay, Dr. Cheyne, Mr. Hart- 
lev% and others. But one of the great- 
er advocates for this doctrine was Dr. 
Chauncy. His arguments are these: 1. 
Christ died not for a select number of 
men only, but for mankind universally, 
and without exception or limitation, for 
the sacred Scriptures are singularly 
emphatical in expressing this truth, 1 
Thes. V. 10. 1 Cor. xv. 3. Rom. v. 6. 1 
Pet. iii. 18. John i. 29. John iii. 16, 17. 
1 John ii. 2. Heb. ii. 9.-2. It is tlie 
purpose of God according to his good 
pleasure that mankind universally, in 
consequence of the death of his Son Je- 
sus Christ, shall certainly and finally be 
saved, Rom. v. 12, &amp;c. Rom. viii. i9 — 
24. Col. i. 19, 20. Eph. iv. 10. Eph. i. 9, 
10. 2 Tim. i. 4. — 3. As a mean, in or- 
der to men's being made meet for sal- 
vation, God will sooner or later, in this 
state or anothei-, reduce them all under 
a wiUing and obedient subjection to his 
moral government, 1 John iii. 8. John 
i. 29. Matt. i. 21. Psalm viii. 5, 6. Heb. 
ii. 6, 9. Phil, ii- 9—11. 1 Cor. xv. 24— 
29. — 4. The Scriptitre language con- 
cerning the rediiced or restored, in con- 
sequence of the mediatory interposition 
of Jesus Christ, is such as leads us into 
the thought, that it is comprehensive of 
mankind universally, Rev. v. 13. 

The opponents, however, of Dr. 
Chauncy, and this doctrine, observe,' on 
the contrary side, tliat the sacred Scrin- 
tures expressly declare th.it the punisli- 
ment of the finally impenitent shall be 
eternal, iNlatt. xvii. 8. Matt. xxv. 41.

The title of Universalists distinguishes 
tliose who embrace the sentiments of 
Mr. Relly. Set Rellyanists. Dr. 
Joseph Huntingdon was a great advocate 
also for universal sah ation, as may be 
seen from a posthumous work of his, 
entitled, " Gal\ inism improved ; or the 
Gospel illustrated in a System of real 
Grace issuing in the Salvation of all 
Mf-n." This work was answered by 
Mr. Nathan Sti'ong, minister of Hart- 
ford, in Connecticut, in which he en- 
deavoui's to reconcile the doctrine of 
eternal misery with the infinite benevo- 
lence of God. 

This doctrine of universal salvation, 
or restoration, besides being generally 
acknowledged by tlie Socniians, has 
been defended in England by Mr. Win- 
chester, and after hini bv Mr. Vidler 
and others. The latter has been op- 
posed by Mr. A. Fuller and Mr. C. 
Jen-am. Dr. Cluuinci/s Salvation of

UNPARDONABLE SIN. See Sin, 

J 8- 

VOW, a solemn and religious pro- 
xnise or oath. [Sec Oath.] It is more 
particularly taken for a solemn pro- 
mise made to God, in which we bind 
ourselves to do or forbear somewhat for 
the promoting of his glory. Under the 
Old Testament dispensation, vows wei-e. 
very common, Judges xi. Numbers 
XXX. But in the New Testament there 
is no command whatevci* fur the obser- 
vation of them. Hence it is supposed 
that vows belong more to tlic ceremo- 
nial law than to the Gosi)el ; and that 
w'e are to be more dependent on divnie 
grace to keep us, than to make resolu- 
tions and vows which we do riot know- 
that we shall be able to perform ; and 
we certainly oiight not to vow any thing 
but what we are abb:: to perform. 

URIM AND THUMMLM (light and 
perfection,) among the ancient Hebrews, 
a certain oracular manner of consulting 
God, which was done by the high 
priest, dressed in his robes, and having 
on his pectoral, or breast-plate. There 
ha\e been a variety of opinions re- 



specting the Urim and Thmnmim, and 
after all we cannot determine what 
they were. The use made of them was, 
to consult (iod in difficult cases relating 
to the whole state of Israel, and some- 
times in cases relating to the king, the 
sanhedrim, the general of the army, or 
some other great personage. 

URSULINES, an order of nuns. 
founded originally by St. Angela, of 
Brescia, in the year 1537, and so called 
from St. Ursula, to whom they were 
dedicated. 

At first, these religious did not live in 
community, but abode separately in 
their fathers' houses ; • and their em- 
ployment was to search for the afflicted, 
to comfort them ; for the ignorant, to 
instruct them ; and for the poor, to re- 
lieve them ; to \'isit the hospitals, and 
to attend upon the sick ; in short, to be 
always ready to do acts of charity and 
compassion. In 1544, pope Paul III. 
confirmed the institution of the Ursu- 
lines. Sir Charles Borromeo brought 
some of them from Brescia to Milan, 
where they nmltiplied to the number of 
four hundred. Pope Gregory XIII. and 
his successors Sixtus V. and Paul V. 
granted new privileges to this congre- 
gation In process of time, the Ursu- 
lines, who before lived separately, be- 
gan to live in community, and embrace 
the regidar life. The first who did si) 
were the Ursulines of Paris, established 
there in 1604, who entered into the 
cloister in the year 1614, by virtue of a 
bull of pope Paul V. The foundress of 
the Ursulines of France was Madame 
Frances de Bermond, who, in 1574, en- 
gaged about twenty-five young women 
of A^•ig^lon to embrace the institute of 
St. Angela of Brescia. The principal 
employ of the Ursulines, since their es- 
tablishment into a regular order, were 
to instruct young women ; and their 
monasteries were a kind of schools, 
whei-e young ladies of the best families 
reccive'd their education. 

USURY, the gain taken for the loan 
of monev or wares. The Jews were al- 
lowed to lend money upon usury to 
strangers, Deut. xxiii. 20 ; but were 
i:)rohibited to take usury from their 
brethren of Israel, at least, if they wei-e 
poor, Exod. xxii.'25. Lev. xxv. i5, 37- 
From the Sci'iptures speaking against 
the practice of usui'v, some have thought 
it unlawful, Psal. xV. 5. Prov. xxviii. 8. 
Ezek. xviii. 8. But it is replied, that 
usury there only means immoderate in- 
terest, or oppression, by taking advan- 
tage of the indigent circumstances of 
our neighbour ; and that it seems as 
lfl^vful foi- a man to receive interest for

money, which another takes pain with, 
improves, and runs the hazard of in 
trade, as it is to receive rent for our land 
which another takeapain with, improves, 
but nins the hazard of in husbandly.

tion of the Bible, and the only one ac- 
knowledged by the church of Rome to 
be authentic. See Bible, No. 32.

WALDENSES, or Valdenses, a 
sect of reformers, who made their first 
appearance about the year 1160. They 
were most numerous about the valleys 
of Piedmont ; and hence, some say, they 
were called Valdenses, or Vaudois, and 
not from Peter Valdo, as others suppose. 
Mosheim, however, gives this account 
of them : he says, that Peter, an opu- 
lent merchant of Lyons, surnamed V'al- 
densis, or Validisius, from Vaux, or 
Waldum, a town in the marquisate of 
Lyons, being extremely zealous for the 
advancement of ti-ue piety and Chris- 
tian knowledge, employed a certain 
priest, called Ste/ihanus de Evisa, about 
the year 1160, in translating, from La- 
tin itito French, the four Gospels, with 
other books of holy Scripture, and- the 
Ttnost remarkable sentences of the an- 
cient doctors, which were so highly es- 
teemed in this century. But no sooner 
had he perused these sacred books with 
a proper degree of attention, than he 
perceived that the religion which was 
now taught in the Roman church, dif- 
fered totally from that which was ori- 
ginally inculcated by Christ and his 
apostles. Struck with this glaring con- 
tradiction between the doctrines of the 
pontiffs and the truths of the Gospel, 
and animated with zeal, he abandoned 
his mercantile vocation, distributed his 
viches among the poor (whence the 
Waldenses were called fioor men ofLtj- 
ons,) and forming an association with 
other pious men who had adopted his 
sentiments and his turn of devotion, he 
began, in the year 1180, to assume the 
quality of a public teacher, and to in- 
struct the multitude in the doctrines and 
precepts of Christianity. 

Soon after Peter had assumed the ex- 
ercise of his ministry, the arch!)) shop 
of Lyons, and the other rulers of the 
church in that province, vigorously op- 
posed himi However, their opposition 
was unsuccessful; for the purity and 
simplicity of that religion which these 
good men taught, the spotless inno- 
cence that shone forth in their lives and 
actions, and the noble contempt of 
riches and honours which was con- 



spicuous in the whole' of tlieir conduct 
and conversation, appeared so engaging 
to all such as had any sense of true 
piety, that the number of . their follow- 
ers daily increased. They accordingly 
formed I'eligious assemblies, first in 
France, and afterwards in Lombardy; 
from whence they propagated their sect 
throughout the other provinces of Eu- 
rope with incredible rapidity, and with 
such invincible fortitude, that neither 
fire nor swoixi, nor the most cruel in- 
ventions of merciless persecution, could 
damp their zeal, or entirely ruin their 
cause. 

The attempts of Peter Waldus and 
his followers were neither employed 
nor designed to introduce new doctrines 
into the church, nor to propose new ar- 
ticles of faith to Christians. All they 
aimed at was, to reduce the form of 
ecclesiastical government, and the man- 
ners both of the clergy and people, to 
that amiable simplicity and primitive 
sanctity that characterized the apostolic 
ages, and which appear so strongly re- 
commended in the precepts and in- 
junctions of the Divine Author of our 
holy religion. In consequence, of this 
design, they complained that the Ro- 
man church had degenorated, under 
Constantine the Great, from its primi- 
tive purity and sanctity. They denied^ 
the supi-emacy of the Roman pontiff", 
and maintained that the rulers and mi- 
nisters of the church were obliged, by 
their vocation, to imitate the poverty 
of the apostles, and to procure for. them- 
selves a subsistence by the work of their 
hands. They considered every Chi-is- 
tian as, in a certain measure, qualified 
and authorised to instruct, exhort and 
confirm the brethren in their Christian 
course ; and demanded the restoration 
of the ancient penitential discipline of 
the church, i. e. the expiation of trans- 
gressions by pi-ayer, fasting, and alms, 
which the new-invented doctrine of in- 
dulgences had almost totallj' abolished. 
They at the same time affirmed, that 
every pious Christian was qualified and 
entitled to prescribe to the penitent the 
kind or degree of satisfaction or expia-

tion that their transgressions required ; 
that confession made to priests was by 
no means necessary, since the humble 
offender might acknowledge his sins 
and testify his repentance to any true 
believer, and might expect from such 
the counsel and admonition which his 
case demanded. They maintained, that 
the power of delivering sinners from the 
guilt and punishment of their offences 
belonged to God alone ; and that in- 
dulgences of consequence, were the 
criminal inventions of sordid avarice. 
I'hey looked upon the prayers and other 
ceremonies that were instituted in be- 
half of the dead, as vain, useless, and 
absurd, and denied the existence of de- 
parted souls in an intermediate state of 
purification ; affirming, that they were 
immediately, upon their separation from 
the body, received into heaven, or 
thrust down to heH. These and other 
tenets of a like nature, composed the 
system of doctrine propagated by the 
Waldenses. It is also said, that several 
of the Waldenses denied the obligation 
of infant baptism, and that otliers re- 
jected water baptism entirely ; but Wall 
has laboured to prove that infant baptism 
was generally practised among them. 

Their niles of practice were extreme- 
ly austere ; for they adopted as the mo- 
del of tkeir moral discipline, the sermon 
of Christ on the mount, which they m- 
terpreted and explained in the most ri- 
gorous and literal manner ; and conse- 
quently prohibited and condemned in 
their society all wa,rs, and suits of law, 
and all attempts towards the acquisition 
of wealth ; the inflicting of capital pu- 
nishments, self-defence against unjust 
violence, and oaths of all kinds. 

During the greatest part of the se- 
venteenth century, those of them who 
lived in the valleys of Piedmont, and 
who had embraced the doctrine, disci- 
pline, and worship of the church of Ge- 
neva, were oppressed and persecuted 
■in the most barbarous and inhuman 
manner by the ministers of Rome. This 
persecution was carried oa with pecu- 
liar marks of rage and enormity m the 
years 1655, 1656, and 1696, and seemed 
to portend nothing less than the total 
extmction of that unhappy nation. The 
most horrid scenes ot violence and 
bloodshed were exhibited in this theatre 
of papal tyranny ; and the few Wal- 
denses that survived, were indebted for 
their existence and support to the in- 
tercession made fjar them by the En- 
glish and Dutch • governments, and also 
by the Swiss cantons, who solicited the 
clemency of the duke of Savoy on their 
behalf. 



WATCHERS. See Acoemet^. 
WATCHFULNESS, vigilance, or 
care to avoid surrounding enemies and 
dangers. We are to watch aga.nst the 
insinuations of Satan; the allurements 
of the world ; the deceitfulness of our 
hearts ; the doctrines of the erroneous; 
and, indeed, against every thing that 
would prove inimical to our best in- 
terests. We are to exercise this duty 
at all times, in all places, and under all 
circumstances, 1 Cor. xvi. 13. Luke 
xii. 37. 

To watch, is also to wait for and ex- 
pect : thus we are, 1.. To watch the 
pro\'idence of God. — 2. The fulfilment 
of the prophecies. — 3. God's time for 
our deliverance from troubles, Psalm 
cxxx. — 4. We are to watch unto prayer, 
Eph. vi. 18. — 5. For death and judg- 
ment, Mark xiii. 37. 

WATERLANDIANS, a sect of 
Anabaptists in Holland. They are thus 
called m distinction from the Flemin- 
gians, or Flandrians, and likewise be- 
cause they consisted at first of the in- 
habitants of a district in North Holland, 
called W^aterland. The Flemingians 
were called the fine or rigid, and the 
Waterlandiaus the gross or moderate 
Anabaptists. The former observe, with 
(jthe most religious accuracy and venera- 
tion, the ancient doctrine and discipline 
of the purer sort of Anabaptists ; the 
latter depart much more from the pri- 
mitive sentiments and manners of their 
sect, and approach nearer to the Pro- 
testant churches. These latter, how- 
ever, are divided into two distinct sects, 
the Waterlanders and the Frieslaud- 
ers; but this difference, it is said, mei-ely 
respects theii; place of abode. Neither 
party have any bishops, but only pres- 
byters and deacons. Each cbngregation 
is independent of all foreign jurisdiction, 
having its own court of government, 
composed of the presbyters and dea- 
cons. But the supreme power bein§^ in 
the hands of the people, nothing of im- 
portance can be transacted without their 
consent. The presbyters are generally 
men of learning ; and they have a public 
professor at Amsterdam for ii&gt;stnictine 
their youth in the different branches of 
erudition^ sacred and profane. About 
1664, the Waterlanders were split into 
the two factions of the Galenists and the 
Apostoolians. Galen, Abraham Haan, 
doctor of. physic, and pastor of the 
Mennonites at Amsterdam, % man of 
uncommon penetration and eloquence, 
inclined towards the Arian and Sociniaii 
tenets, and insisted for the reception of 
all such into their church fellowship as 
acknowledged tlie divine authority of

the Scriptures, and led virtuous lives. 
Pie and his followers renounced the 
designation of the Mennonites. They 
were with great zeal opposed by Samuel 
Apostool, another physician aiid emi- 
nent pastor at Amsterdam, who, with 
his fjllowers, admitted none to their 
communion but such as professed to be- 
lieve all the points of doctrine contained 
hi their public Confession of Faith. 

WEDNESDAY; ASH. The first 
day of Lent, when, in the primitive 
church, notorious, sinners, were put to 
open penance thus: They appeared at 
the church door barefooted, aud clothed 
in sackcloth, where, being examined, 
their discipline was proportioned ac- 
cording to their oifences ; after which, 
being brought into- the church, the bi- 
shop singing tlie seven penitential 
]&gt;salms, they prostrated themselves, 
arid with tears begged absolution; the 
•whole congregation having ashes on 
their heads, to signify, that thev were 
both mortal and deserved to be biinit to 
ashes for their sins. 

WESTMINSTER ASSEMBLY, a 
name given to the synod of di\ ines call- 
ed by parliament m the reigii of Charles 
I. for the puipose of settling the go- 
vernment, liturgy, and doctrine of the 
church of England. They were confinock 
in their debates to such things as the 

Earliamcnt proposed. Some counties 
ad two members, and some but one. 
And because the)' would seem impar- 
tial, and gi\'e each paj-ty the liberty to 
speak, they chose many of the most 
learned episcopal divines ; but few of 
them came, because it was not a legal 
convocation, the king having declared 
against it; The divines -were men of 
eminent lefirning and godliness, minis- 
terial abilities, and fidelity. Many lords 
and commons were joined with them, to 
see that they did not go beyond their 
commission. Six or seven Independents 
were also added to them, that all sides 
might be heard. This assembly first 
met, July 1, 1643, in Henry the Seventh's 
Chapel. The most remarkable hints 
concerning their debates are to be found 
in the Lffe of Dr. Lightfoot, before his 
works, in folio, and in the Preface to his 
Remains, in octavo. See also the yh- 
Rcinbli/s Confession of J^^xith ; ^X'^at's 
Hist, of the Puritans; and article Di- 
rectory in this work. There is a pub- 
lication, which is commonly IjOit unjustly 
ascribed to this assembly, viz. The A)i- 
7!Otations on the Bible. The truth is, 
the same pai-liament that called flie as- 
sembly, employed tlie authors of that 
work, and several of them were mem- 
bers of the assembl)-. 



WHIPPERS, or Pl.^gellan'tes, a 
sect of wild fanatics, who chastised and 
disciplined themselves with whips in 
iniblic. It had its rise in Italy in the year 
1260 : its author was one Rainer, a her- 
mit ; and it was propagated from hence 
I through almost all the countries of Eu- 
rope. A great number of persons, of all 
ages and sexes, made processions, walk- 
ing two by two, with their shoulders 
bare, which they whipped till the blood 
ran down, in oi-der to obtain mercy from 
God, and appease his indignation agains 
the wickedness of the age. They were 
then called the Devout; and having es- 
tablished a superior, he was called Ge- 
neral of the Devotion. Though the pri- 
mitive Whippers were exemplary in 
point of morals, yet they were joined by 
a turbulent rabble, who were infected 
with the most ridiculous and impious 
opinions : so that thd emperors and pon- 
tiffs thought proper to put an end to this 
religious frenzy, by declaring all devout 
whipping contrary to the divine la^v:, 
and prejudicial to the soul's eternal in- 
terest. 

However, tliis sect re\ived in Ger- 
many towards the middle of the next 
century, and, rambjing through many 
protinces, occasioned great disturbances. 
They held&gt; among other things, that 
whipping was of equal virtue with bap- 
tism, and the other sacraments ; that the 
forgiveness of all sins was to be obtained 
by it from God without the inerits of 
Jesus Christ ; that the old law of Christ 
was soon to be abolished, and that a new 
law, enjoining the baptism of blood to I)e 
administered by whipping, was to be 
substituted in its place: upon which 
Clement VII. by an injudicious as well 
as unrighteous ' policy, thundered out 
anathemas against the Whippers, who 
were burnt by the inquisitors m se\'eral 
places : but they were not easily extir- 
pated. They appeared again in Thu- 
ringia and l^owjer Saxony in the fifteenth 
century, and rejected not only the sa- 
craments, but every branch of external 
v/orship ; and placed their only hopes 
of salvation in faith and vv'hip'ping, to 
which they added other strange doc- 
trines concerning evil spirits. Their 
leader, Conrad Schmidt, and many 
otliers, were committed to the flames by 
German inquisitors, in and after the 
year 1414.

it is called Whitsunday or White- 
^^imday, because this being one of the

upon the apostles happened on that day 
which the Jews called Feiitecost, this 
festival retained the name of Fentecont 
amone the Christians. 

WfCKEDNESS. See Sin. 

WICKLIFP^ITES, the followers of 
the famous John Wickliffe, called " the 
first reformer," who was born in York- 
shire in the year 1324. He attacked 
the jurisdiction of the pope and the bi- 
shops. He was fortius twice summoned 
to a council at Lambeth, to give an ac- 
count of his doctrines ; but being coun- 
tenanced by the duke of Lancaster, was 
both times dismissed without condem- 
nation. Wickhffe, therefore, continued 
to spread his new principles as usual, 
adding to them doctrines still niore 
alarming; by which he drew after him 
a great number of disciples. Upon 
this^ \^'illiam Courtney, abp. of Can- 
terbury, called another council in 1382, 
which condemned 24 propositions of 
Wickliffe and his disciples, and obtain- 
ed a declar^tiou of Richard U. against 
all who should pi'each them : but while 
these proceedings were agitating, Wick- 
liffe died at liUtterworth, leaving many- 
works behind him for the estaljlishment 
of his doctrines. He was buried in his 
own church, at Lutterworth, in Lei- 
cestershire, where his bones Were suf- 
fered to rest in peace till the year 1428, 
when, by an order from the pope, they 
were taken up and burnt. Wickliffe 
■was doubtless a veiy extraoi-dinary 
man, considering the times in which he 
lived. He discovered the absurdities 
and impositions of the church of Rome, 
and had the honesty anji resolution to 
promulgate his opinions, which a little 
more support would probably have ena- 
bled him to establish : they were evi- 
dently the foundation of the subsequent 
reformation. 

W1LHELMINL\NS, a denomina- 
tion in the 13th century, so called from 
Wilhelmina, a Bohemian woman, who 
resided in the territoiy of Milan. She 
persuaded a large number that the Ho- 
ly Ghost was become incarnate in her 
person for the salvation of a great part 
of mankind. According to her doctnnes 
none were saved by the blood of Jesus ij 
but true and pious Chiiijtiaas ; v/hile the 



Jews, Saracens, and unworthy Chris- 
tians, were to obtain salvation through 
the Holy Spirit which dwelt in hei-, and 
that, in consequence thereof, all which 
happened in Christ during his appear- 
ance upon earth in the human nature, 
was to be exactly renewed in her per- 
son,_or rather in that of the Holy Ghost, 
which was united to her. 

WILKINSONIANS, the followers 
of Jemima \\'ilkinson, who was born in 
Cumberland iji America. In October 
17r6, she asserted that she was. taken 
sick, and ' actually died, and that her 
soul went to heaven, where it still con- 
tinues. Soon aftei', her body was re- 
animated with the spirit and power of 
Christ, upon which slie set up as a pub- 
lic teacher; and declared she had an 
immediate revelation for all she deliver- 
ed, and was arrived to a state of abso- 
lute perfection. It is also said she pre- 
tended to foretel future events, to dis- 
cern the secrets of the heart, and to 
have tlie power of healing diseases ; 
and if any person who had riiade appli- 
cation to her was not healed, she attri- 
buted it to his want of faith. She assert- 
ed tliat those who refused to believe 
these exalted things conceniing her, 
will be in the state of the unbelieving 
Jews, who rejected the coimcil of Ciod 
against themsehes; and she told her 
hearers that was the eleventli hour, and 
the last call of mercy that ever should 
be granted them : for she heard an in- 
quiry in Itcaven, saying, " Who will g« 
and* preach to a dying world ?" or words 
to tliat import ; and she said she an- 
swered, " Here am I — send me ;" and 
that she left the realms of light and 
glory, and the company of the heavenly 
host, who are continually praising and 
worshipping God, in order to descend 
upon earth, and pass through many suf- 
ferings and trials for the happiness of 
mankind. She assumed the title of the 
universal, friend of mankind; hence her 
foUoAvers distinguished themselves by 
the name of Friends. 

WILL, tliat faculty of the soul by 
which it chooses or refuses any thing 
offered to it. When man was crated, 
he had liberty and power to do what 
was pleasing in the sight of God ; but 
by the tall, he lost all ability of will to 
any spii-itual good ; nor has he any will 
to that which is good until divine grace 
enlightens the understanding and 
changes the heart. "The nature of 
the v.- ill, indeed, is in itself indisputably 
free. \Vill, as will, must be so, or there 
is no such faculty ; but the human will, 
being finite, hath a necessary bound, 
which indeed so far may be said to con-

fine it, because it cannot act beyond it ; 
yet within the extent of its capacity it 
necessarily is and ever will be sponta- 
neous. 

" The limits of the will, therefore, do 
not take away its inherent liberty. The 
exercise of its powers maj^ be confined, 
as it necessarily must, in a finite being ; 
but where it is' not confined, thai exer- 
cise will correspond with its nature and 
situation. 

" This being understood, it is easy to 
perceive that man in his fallen state can 
only will according to his fallen capaci- 
ties, and that, however freely his voli- 
tions may flow within their extent, he 
cannot possibly overpass them. He, 
therefore, as a sinful, carnal, and per- 
verse apostate, can ivill only according 
to the nature of his apostacv, which is 
continually and invariably evil, without 
capacity to exceed its bounds into good- 
ness, purity, and truth ; or otherwise he 
would will contrary to or beyond his 
nature and situation, which is equally 
impossible in itself, and contradictory 
to the revelation of God. See Ed- 
wurds on the IV'Ul ; Theol. Misc. vol. 
iv. p. 391 ; Gill's Cause of God and 
Truth; Tofilady's Historic Proof;

WILL WORSHIP, the invention and 
practice of such expedients of appeasing 
or of pleasing God, as neither reason nor 
revelation suggest. 

WILL OF GOD is taken, 1. For 
that which he has from all eternity de- 
termined, which is unchangeable, and 
must certainly come to pass; this is 
called his secret will. — 2. It is taken 
for what he has prescribed to us in his 
word as a rule of duty : this is called his 
re~vealed will. A question of very gi'eat 
importance respecting our duty deserves 
here to be considered. The question is 
this: "How may a person wno is de- 
sirous of following the dictates of Pro- 
videqpe in every respect, know the mind 
and will of God in any particular cir- 
cumstance, whether temporal or spi- 
ritual? Now, in order to come at the 
knowledge of that which is proper and 
needful for us to be'acquainted with, we 
are taught by prudence and conscience 
to make use of, 1. Deliberation. — 2. 
Consultation. — 3. Supplication; but, 1. 
We should not make our inclinations the 
rule of our conduct. — 2. We should not 
make our particular frames the rule of 
our judgment and determination. — 3. 



We are not to be guided by any unac- 
countable impulses and impressions. — 
4. We must not make the event our 
rule of judgment. 1. Unless something 
different from our present situation oi'^ 
fer itself to our serious consideration, 
we are not to be desirous of changing 
our state, except it is unprofitable or 
unlawful. — 2. When an alteration of 
circumstance is proposed to us, or Pro- • 
vidence lays two or more things before 
our eyes, we should endeavour to take 
a distinct view of each case, compare 
them with one another, and then de- 
termine by such maxims as these: — Of 
two natural evils choose the least ; of 
two moral e\' ils choose neither ; of two 
moral or spiritual good things choose 
the greatest. — 3. When upon due con- 
sideration, nothing appears in the ne- 
cessity of the case or the leadings of 
Providence to make the way clear, we 
must not hurry Providence,' but remain 
in a state of suspense ; or abide wiiere 
we are, waiting upon the Lord by pray- 
er, and waiting for the Lord in the way 
of his providence. In .dl cases, it should 
be our pei-petual concern to keep as 
much as possible out of the way of 
temptation to omit any duty, or commit 
any sin. We should endeavour to keep 
up a reverence for the word and pro- 
vidence of God upon our hearts, and to 
have a stead)^ eye to his glory, and to 
behold God in convenant, aj managing 
every providential circumstance in sub- 
serviency to his gracious pui-poses in 
Christ Jesus." Pike and Hay%vard's 
Cases of Conscience, p. 156. 

WISDOM denotes a high and refined 
notion of things, immediately presented 
to the mind, as it were, by intuition, 
witliout the assistance of reasoning. In 
a moral sense, it signifies the same as 
prudence, or that knowledge by which 
we connect the best means with the best 
ends. Some, however, distinguish wis- 
dom from pnidence thus: wisdom leads 
us to speak and act what is most proper; 
prudence prevents our speaking or 
acting improperly. A wise man employs 
the most proper means for success ; a 
prudent man the safest means for not 
being brought into danger. 

S/iiritual wisdom consists in the know- 
ledge and fear of God. It is beautiful- 
ly described by St. James, " as pure, 
peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, 
full of mercy and good fniits, without 
partiality, and without hypoci'isy.'* 
James iii. 17. See Devotion, Re- 
ligion.

attribute of his nature by which he

WITCHCRAFT, a " supernatural 
power which persons were formerly 
supposed to obtain the possession of, by 
entering into a compact with the Devil. 
Witchcraft was universally believed in 
Europe till the 16th century, and even 
maintained its ground with tolerable 
finnness till the middle of the I7th. 
The latest witchcraft phrensy was in 
New England in 1692, when the exe- 
cution of witches became a calamity 
more dreadful than the sword or the 
pestilence. Some have denied the ex- 
istence of witchcraft altogether. That 
such persons have been found among 
men seems, however, evident ii-om the 
Scriptures, Deut. xviii. 10. Exod. xxii. 
18. Gal. v. 20. Lev. xix. 13. Lev. xx. 
6. The inconsistency of holding such 
persons in estimation, or having re- 
course to fortune-tellei's, diviners, 
charmers, and such like, appear in this, 
1. It is imitating the heathens, and 
giving countenance to the foolish super- 
stition and absurd practices of pagans. 
— 2. Such characters are held in ab- 
horrence by the Lord, and their very 
existence forbidden. Lev. xx. 6. Exod. 
XX. 18. — 3. He threatens to punishthose 
who consult them. Lev, xx. 6. — 4. It is 
wrong to have any thing to do with 
them, as it is setting an awful example 
to others. — 5. It is often productive of 
the gi-eatest evils, deception, discord, 
disappointment, and incredible mis- 
chief. See Hawkins's Two Sermons on 
Witchcraft; Enc. Brit. ; Moore's Theo- 
logical Works, p. 240, 251 ; Hutihinson 
on Witchcraft. 

WONDER, any thing which causes 
surprise by its strangeness. " It ex- 
presses," says Mr. Cogan, " an embar- 
rassment of the mind after it is some- 
what recovered from the first percus- 
sion of surprise. It is the effect pro- 
duced by an interesting subject which 
has been suddenly presented to the 
mind, but concerning which there are 



many intricacies, either respecting the 
cause or manner in which any event has 
taken place, motives of extraordinary- 
conduct, &amp;c." How it differs from ad- 
miration, see Admiration. 

WORKS OF GOD.' See Bible, 
Revelation, Scripture. 

WORKS, GOOD, are those actions 
which are conformable to truth, jus- 
tice, or propriety ; whether natural, 
civil, relative, moral, or religious. The 
circumstances requisite to a good work, 
are, 1. That it be according to the will 
of God. — 2. That it spring from love to 
God, 1 1 im. i. 5. — 3. It must be done 
in faith, Rom. xiv. 23. — 4. It must be 
done to the gloiy of God, 1 Cor. x. 31. 
Phil. i. 11. 77ie causes of good works 
are, 1. God himself, Heb. xiii. 21. — 2. 
Bv union to Christ, Eph. ii. 10. — 3. 
Through faith, Heb. xi. 4, 6. — 4. By the 
word and Spirit, Luke, viii. 15. Is. iii. 3. 
2 Tim. iii. 16. As to the nature and 
properties of good works, 1. They are 
imperfect, Ecc. vii. 20. Rev. iii. 2. — 2, 
Not meritorious. Tit. iii. 5. Luke, xvii. 
10. — 3. Yet found only in the regenerate. 
Matt. vii. 17. The necessary uses of good 
works, 1. They show our gratitude, Ps, 
cxv.' 12, 13. — 2. Are an ornament to our 
profession. Tit. ii. 10. — 3. Evidence our 
regeneration. Job, xv. 5. — 4. Profitable

WORLD, the whole system of cre- 
ated things. [See Creation.] It is 
taken also for a secular life, the present 
state of existence, and the pleasure and 
interests which steal away the soul from 
God. The love of the World does not 
consist in the use and enjoyment of the 
comforts God gives us, but in an inordi- 
nate attachment to the things of time 
and sense. " 1. We love the world toO 
much," says Dr. Jortin, " when, for the 
sake of any profit or pleasure, we. wil- 
fully, knowingly, and deliberately trans- 
gress the commands of God. — 2. When 
we take more pains about the present 
life than the next. — 3. \Mien we can- 
not be contented, patient, or resigned, 
under low and incon^■enient circum- 
stances.— ^4. We love the world too 
much when we cannot part with any 
thing we possess to those who want, de- 
serve, and have a right to it. — 5. When 
we envy those who are more fortunatc 
and more favoured by the world than 
we are. — 6. When we honour, and es- 
teem, and favour persons purely ac 
cording to their birth, fortunes, and suc- 
cess, measuring our judgment .and ap-

probation by their outward appearance 
and situation in life. — 7. When worldly 
prosperity makes us proud, and vain, 
and arrogant. — 8. When we omit no 
opportunity of enjoying the good things 
of this life ; when our great and chief 
business is to divert ourselves till we 
contract an indifference for rational and 
manly occupations, deceiving ourselves, 
and fancving that we are not in a bad 
condition because others are worse than 
we." See Jortin's Ser. vol. iii. ser. 9. ;

World; Dr. Stennet^s Sermon on^Con-

WORLD, Jges of. The time pre- 
ceding the birth of Christ has generally 
been divided into six ages. The first 
extends from the beginning of the world 
to the deluge, and comprehends one 
thousand six hundred and hfty-six years. 
The second, from the deluge to Abra- 
ham's entering the Land of Promise, in 
2082, comprehends four hundred and 
twenty-six years. The third from 
Abraham's entrance into the promised 
land to the Exodus in 2.523, four hun- 
dred and thirty years. The fourth, from 
the going out of Egypt to the fo\mdation 
of the temple by Solomon in 2992, four 
hundred and seventy-nine years. The 
fifth, from Solomon's foundation of the 
temple to the Babylonish captivity in 
3416, four hundred and twenty-one 
years. The sixth, from the Babvlonish 
captivity to the birth of Christ,' A. M. 
4000, the fourth year before the vulgar 
lera, includes five hundred and eighty- 
four years.

WORSHIP, D.^MON, the worship 
of a class of spirits which were thought 
to be superior to the soul of man ; but 
inferior to those intelligences which ani- 
mated the sun, the moon, and the pla- 
nets, and to whom were committed the 
government of the world, particular 
nations, 8cc. Though they were gene- 
rally invisible, they were not supposed 
to be pure disembodied spirits, but to 
have some kind of ethereal vehicle. 
They were of various orders, and ac- 
cordmg to the situation over which they 
presided, had different names. Hence 
the Greek and Roman poets talk of 
satyrs, dryads, nymphs, fawns, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
These different orders of intelligences 
which, though worshipped as gods or 
demigods, were yet believed to partake 
of human passions and appetites, led the 



way to the deification of departed he- 
roes, and other eminent benefactors of 
the human race ; and from this latter 
probably arose the belief of natural and 
tutelar gods, as well as the practice of 
worshipping these gods through the 
medium of statues cut into a human 
figure. S.ee Idolatry and Polythe- 
ism. Warbnrton''.'i Divine Legation; 
Farmer on the Worshifi of Dgemons ; 
Gale's Court of the Gentiles. 

W^ORSHIP OF GOD {cultus Dei) 
amounts to the same 'with what we 
otherwise call religion. This worship 
consists in paying a due respect, vene- 
ration, and homage to the Df-ity. under 
a sense of an obligation to him. And 
this internal respect, &amp;:c. is to be shown 
and testified by external acts ; as pray- 
ers, thanksgivings,. &amp;c. 

Prix'ate Worshifi should be conducted 
with, L Reverence and veneration. — 2. 
Self-abasement and confession. — 3. Con"- 
templation of the perfections and pro- 
mises of God. — 4. Supplication for our- 
selves and others. — 5. Earnest desire 
of the enjoyment of God. — 6. Frequent 
and regular. Some who have acknow- 
ledged the propriety of private worship 
have objected to that of a ])ublic nature, 
but without any sufficient ground. For 
Christ attended public worship himself, 
Luke, iv. he praved with his disciples, 
Luke, ix. 28, 29. 'Luke, xi. 1 ; he pro- 
mises his presence to social worship- 
pers. Matt, xviii. 20. It may be argued 
also from the conduct of the apostles. 
Acts i. 24. Acts ii. Acts iv. 24. Acts 
vi. 4. Rom. XV. 30. 1 Cor. xiv. Acts 
xxi. 2 Thess. iii. 1, 2. 1 Cor. xi. and 
from general precepts, 1 I'im. ii. 2, 8. 
Hebrews x. 25. Deut. xxxi. 12. Ps. 
c. 4. 

Public worship is of great utility,' as, 
l..It gives Christians an opportunity of 
openly professing their faith in and love 
to Chi'ist. — 2. It preserves a sense of 
religion in the mind, without which so- 
ciety could not well exist. — 3. It- en- 
livens devotion and promotes zeal.^-4. 
It is the mean of receiving instruction 
and consolation. — 5. It affords an excel- 
lent example to others, and excites 
thehi to fear God, dec. 

Public worshifi should be, 1. Solemn, 
not light and trifling, Ps."lxxxix. 7. — 2. 
Simple, not jjompous and cei'emonial, 
Isa. Ixii. 2. — 3. Cheerful, and not with 
forbidding aspect, Ps. c. — 4. Sincere, 
and not hypocritical, Isaiah, i. 12. Matt, 
xxiii. 13. John iv. 24. — 5. Pure and not 
superstitious, Isaiah, Ivii. 15.

out taking notice of tlie shameful and

ing in late to public worship. It evi- 
dently manifests a state of lukewarm- 
ness ; it is a breach of order and de- 
cency; it is a disturbance to both minis- 
ters and people; it is slighting the ordi- 
nances which God has appointed for our 
good; and an aifront to God himself! 
How such can be in a devotional frame 
themselves, when they so often spoil the 
devotions of others, I know not. See

WRATH, violent and permanent 
anger. See Anger. 



WRATH OF GOD is his indigna- 
tion at sin, and punishment of it, Rom. 
i. 18. The objects of God'.s anger or 
wrath are the ungodly, whom he has 
declared he will punish. His wrath is 
sometimes manifested in this life, and 
that in an awful degree, as we see in the 
case of the old world, Sodom and Go- 
morrah, the plagues of Egypt, the pu- 
nishment and captivity of the Jews, and 
the many striking judgments on nations 
and individuals. But a still more awful 
punishment awaits the impenitent in the 
world to come ; for the wicked, it is 
said, shall go away into everlasting pu- 
nishment, where the worm dieth not, 
and the fire is not quenched, Matt. 
XXV. 46. Rom. ii. 8, 9. Rem. i. 18. See 
Hell, Sin.

ZACHEANS, the disciples of Za- 
cheus, a native of Palestine, who, about 
the year 350, retired to a mountain near 
the city of Jerusalem, and there per- 
formed his devotions in secret ; pre- 
tending that prayer was only agreeable 
to God when it was performed secretly, 
and in silence. 

ZEAL, a passionate ardour for any 

Eerson or cause. There are various 
inds of zeal ; as, 1. An ignorant zeal, 
Rom. X. 2, 3.' — 2. A persecuting zeal, 
Phil, iii. 6. — 3. A superstitious zeal, 
1 Kings, xviii. Gal. i. 14. — 4. An hypo- 
critical zeal, 2 Kings x. 16. — 5. A con- 
tentious zeal, 1 Cor. xi. 1'6. — 6. A par- 
tial zeal, Hos. vii. 8. — 7. A temporaiy 
zeal, 2 Kings, xii. and xiii. Gal. iv. 15, 
16. — 8. A genuine zeal, which is a sin- 
cere and warm concern for the glory of 
God, and the spiritual welfare of man- 
kind. This is generally compounded of 
sound knowledge, strong faith, and dis- 
interested regard ; and will manifest it- 
self by self-denial, patient endurance, 
and constant exertion. The motives to 
true zeal are, 1. The divine command, 
Rev. iii. 19. — 2. The example of Clirist, 
Acts X. 38. — 3. The iiriportance of the 
service of Christ. — 4-. The advantage 
and pleasure it brings to the possessor. 
— 5. The instances and honourably com- 
mendation of it in the Scriptures : Mo- 
ses, Phineas, Caleb, David, Paul, ?cc. 
Gal.iv. 18. Rev. iii. 15, &amp;c. Tit. ii. 14.—

ZEND, or Zendavesta, a book as- 
cribed to Zoroaster, and containing his 
pretended revelations, which the an- 
cient Magicians and modern Persees 
oliserve and reverence in the same man- 
ner as the Christians do tlie Bible, 
making it the sole nde of their faith and 
manners. The Zend contains areformed 
system of m agianii.m, teaching that there 
is a Supreme Being, eternal, self-ex- 
istent, and independent, who created 
both light and darkness, out of which he 
made all other things ; that these are in 
a state of conflict, which will continue 
to the end of the world ; that then there 
shall be a general resurrection and 

j judgment, and that just retribution 
shall be rendered unto men according 

I to their works ; that the angel of dark 
ncss, with his followers, shall be con- 
signed to a place of everlasting darkness 
and punishment ; and the angel of light, 
with his disciples, introduced into a state 
of everlasting light and hapjMness : after 
which, light and darkness shall no more 
interfere" with each other. It is evi- 
dent, from these, and various other sen- 
timents contained in the Zend, that ma- 
ny parts of it are taken out of the Old

METHODIST EPISCOPAL 
CHURCH IN THE UNITED 
STATES, History o/— The first Me- 
thodist society in the United States of 
America, was formed in the City of 
New- York, in the year 1766, by a few 
Methodist emigrants from Ireland. 
Among these was a local preacher, by 
the name of Philip Embury. He preach- 
ed the first Methodist sermon in a pri- 
vate room, to those only who had ac- 
companied him to this country. The 
name of Methodist and his manner of 
preaching, being a novelty in this coun- 
try, soon attracted attention, and many 
came to hear the stranger for them- 
selves ; and the number of hearers so 
increased that the house in which they 
assembled very soon became too small 
to contain all who wished to hear. They 
accordingly procured a larger place. 
About this time considei'able attention 
was excited by the preaching of Capt. 
Webb, who came from Albany, where 
he was stationed, to the help of Mr. 
Embury. This gentleman had been con- 
verted to God under the preaching of 
Mr. Wesley in Bristol, England, and 
being moved with compassion towards 
his fellow, men, although a soldier, he 
now employed his talent in calling sin- 
ners to repentance. Through his and 
the labours of Mr. Embury, the work of 
God prospered, and the society increas- 
ed in- number and stability. From the 
Elace they now occupied, which soon 
ecame too small to accommodate all 
who wished to attend their meetings, 
they removed to a riggin^-loft, in Wil- 
liam-street, which they hired, and fitted 
up for a preaching room. 

Such was their continual increase that, 
after contending with a variety of diffi- 
culties for want of a convenient place of 
"WOi*ship, they succeeded in erecting a 



MET 

meeting-house in John-street, in the 
year 1768. 

About the same time that this society 
was establishing in New-York, Mr. 
Strawbridge, a local preacher from Ire- 
land, commenced preaching, and form- 
ed a small class in Frederick County, 
Maryland. 

In October, 1769, two preachers, 
Messrs. Richard Boardman and Joseph 
Pilmore, being sent under the direction 
of Mr. \Vesley, landed in America : and 
in 1771, Messrs. Francis Asbury asd 
Richard Wright came over. The first 
regular conference was held in Phili- 
delphia, in the year 1773, under the si- 
perintendence of Mr. Thomas Rankri, 
who had been sent by Mr. Wesley :o 
take the general oversight of the socie- 
ties in this countiT- These zealous mis- 
sionaries, spreading themselves in di- 
ferent directions through the countiy, 
cities and villages, were instrumental 
in extending the infiirence of evangeli- 
cal principles and holiness among the 
people. 

During the revolutionary war, all the 
preachers from Europe, except Mr. 
Asbury, returned to their native land. 
But prior to this event, the Head of the 
church had, under the energetic labours 
of Mr. Asbury and his colleagues, called 
forth some zealous young men into tlie 
ministry, whose laboui's were owned of 
God in the awakening and conversion 
of souls. These men of God, under the 
superintendence of Mr. Asbury, who 
laboured hard and suffered much during 
the sanguinary conflict, continued in the 
field of Gospel labour ; and, notwith- 
standing the evils inseparable from war, 
tljey witnessed the spread of pure reli- 
gion in many places. 

At the conclusion of the revolution, in 
the year 1784, Dr. Thomas Coke came

to America with powers to constitute 
the Methodist societies in this country 
ijito an independent church. Hitherto 
tlie societies had been dependent on 
«)ther churches for the- ordinances of 
baptism and the Lord's supper, as the 
Methodist preachers were considered 
only lay-preacliers, and according to the 
uniform advice of Mr. Wesley, had de- 
clined administerinij the ordinar^ces. 
This had occasioned much uneasiness, 
among both preachers and people, in 
this country. They therefore earnestly 
requested Mr. Wesley to interpose his 
autliorit}^ and furnish them with the 
ordinances independently of other de- 
nominations. After maturely weighing 
the subject in his own mindj he finally 
resolved, as the United States had be- 
come independent of both the ci\il and 
ecclesiastical polity of Great Britain, 
tq send them the help they so much 
needed. Accordingly, being assisted 
bt other presbyters "of tlie Church of 
Eigland, by prayer and imposition of 
hinds, he set apart Thomas Coke, 
LjL. D. and a presbyter of said church, 
an a superintendent of the Methodist 
sccieties in America ; and directed him 
to consecrate Mr. Francis Asbury for 
tqe same ofnce. In conformity to these 
iniitructions, after his arrival in the 
IJiited States, a conference of preach- 
ers was assembled in Baltimore, De- 
cember 25, 1784, amounting in all to 61. 
1-javing communicated his instructions, 
a»d the contemplated plans for the fu- 
tijre government of the societies, which 
^\iere generally approved, INIr. Asburv, 
l)^;ng first elected by the unanimous 
•voice of tlie preachetsj was ordained by 
Dr. Coke first to the office of deacon, 
then elder, and then superintendent or 
tishop. Twelve" of tlie preachers were 
dectcd and ordained elders at the same 
conference. 

These ])roceedings gave very general 
Satisfaction to preachers and "people. 

S"'he number of members in society at 
lis time was 14,988, and of preachers 
3. And as an evidence of the benefits 
lesulting from the recent organization 
flf the church, the work of God grew 
and nmltiplied more than ever, and 
tiany were added to the church. Mr. 
Asbury being thus commended to the 
jrace of God and the affections of his 
people, took a more general oversight 
of the whole church, travelling from 
«ne part of the continent to another, 
preaching the Gospel of the kingdom, 
and assembling the preachers at difier- 
ent times and places, and appointing 
them to their several stations. In conse- 
quence of extending over so large a ter- 



ritory, for they soon spread over all the 
settlements in the United States, it be- 
came inconvenient for all the preachers 
to convene at one time and place ; they 
were therefore divided into several an- 
nual conferences, at a suitable time and 
distance from each other, for the super- 
intending bishop to meet with them, 
direct their councils and assign each 
man to his work. But these separate 
assemblies, unless they all agreed in 
each others regulations, could ordain 
nothing that should be binding upon the 
whole ; and therefore, to supply this 
deficiency of the government, a general 
conference, com])osed of all the travel- 
ling elders, was found expedient and 
necessaiy. But from the continual in- 
crease of preachers and extension of 
j their work, it became quite burdensome 
for so many elders to convene together, 
from so great a distance, and at sueh an 
expense of both time and money : hence, 
to exonerate the church from this unne- 
cessary burden, in the year 1808, notice 
being previously given to the annual 
conferences of the intention, the gene- 
ral conference resolved on a delegated 
general conference, whose powers and 
privileges were defined and restricted 
m the following words : 

" 1. The general conference shall be 
composed of one member for every five 
or seven* members of each annual con- 
ference, to be appointed either by se- 
niority or clioice, at the disci'etion of 
such annual conference : yet so tliat 
such representatives shall have travel- 
led at least four full calendar years from 
the time that they were received on 
trial by an annual confei'ence, and are 
in full connexion at the time of holding 
the conference. 

2. The general conference shall meet 
on the first day of May, in the year of 
our Lord 1812, in the city of New-York, 
and thenceforward on the first day of 
May, once in four years perpetually, in 
such place or places as shall be fixed 
on by the general con fere nee. from time 
to time : but the general superinten- 
dents, with or by the advice of all the 
annual conferences, or if there be no 
general superintendent, all the annual 
conferences respectively, shall . have 
power to call a general conference, if 
they judge it necessary at any time. 

3. At all times when the general con- 
ference is met, it shall take two-thirds 
of the representatives of all the annual 



* The last gpneral conference fixed the num- 
ber of delegates at one for every seven inern- 
bera of the annual conferences.

conferences to make a quorunn for trans- 
acting business. 

4. One of the general superintendents 
shall preside in the general conference ; 
but in case no general superintendent 
be present, the general conference shall 
choose a president pro tempore. 

5. The general conference shall have 
full powers to make rules and regula- 
tions for our church, under the follow- 
ing limitations and restrictions, viz. 

1. The general conference shall not 
revoke, alter, or change our articles of 
religion, nor establish any new standards 
or rules of doctrine contrary to our pre- 
sent existing and established standards 
of doctrine. 

2. They shall not allow of more than 
one representativ.e for every five mem- 
bers of the annual conference, nor allow 
of a less number than one for every 
seven. 

3. They shall not change or alter any 
part or rule of our government, so as to do 
away episcopacy, or destroy the plan of 
our itinerant general superintendency. 

4. They shall not revoke or cha:ige 
the genei-al rales of the united societies. 

5. They shall not do away the privi- 
leges of our ministers or preachers of 
trial by a committee, and of an appeal : 
Neither shall they do away the privi- 
leges of our members of trial before the 
society, or by a committee, and of an 
appeal. 

6. They shall not appropriate the 
produce of the book concern, or of the 
charter fund, to any purpose, other than 
for the benefit of the travelling, super- 
numerary, superannuated and worn- 
out preachers, their wives, widows and 
children. Provided nevertheless, that 
upon the joint recommendation of all 
the annual conferences, then a majority 
of two-thirds of the general conference 
succeeding, shall suffice to alter any of 
the above resti'ictions." 

This conference was composed of 
about 120 members from the several 
annual conferences. At that time there 
were but seven annual conferences ; 
but in consequence of the great increase 
of preachei's and people, scattered all 
over the United States and their terri- 
tories, including Upper Canada, it be- 
came necessary to multiply these con- 
ferences, so that there ai-e now (1824,) 
seventeen. These include, according to i 
the Minutes of their conferences for I 
1824, 

Travelling preachers 1,272 

White members 280,427 

Coloured 48,040 



This number has been raised up, ex- 
clusive of tlie thousands who have gone 
to rest, by the labours of Methodist 
preachers, without funds,* without col- 
leges, often in the midst of persecutions 
and reproaches, in the short space of 
56 years. Upon a moderate calculation, 
there are not less than one million who 
are constant attendants upon the Me- 
thodist ministry, vvluch is about the tenth 
j)art of the population of the United 
States.f 

In 1819 the Missionary Society of the 
I Metliodibt Episcopal Church wasform- 
1 ed ; and it received the sanction of tlie 
I general conference in 1820, according 
j to the following constitution : 

" 1. This association shall be denomi- 
! nated ' The Missionary Society of the 
\ Methodist EfiiscuJicU Church;' the ob- 
ject of which is, to enable the several 
I annual conferences more effectually to 
', extend their missionary labours through- 
j out the United States, and elsewhere. 

2. The business of this society shall 
be conducted t&gt;y a president, thirteen 
vice-presidents, clerk, recording and 
I corresponding secretary, treasui-er, and 
j thirty -two managers, all of whom shatl 
I be members of the Methodist Episco- 
i pal Church. Tlie president, first tVv-o 
! vice-presidents, ^lerk, secretaries, trea- 
I surer, and the thirty-two managers, 
I shall be elected by the society annually, 
I and each annual conference shall ha\ e 
I the privileges of appointing one vice- 
president from its own body. 



* Perhaps the charter fund may be consi- 
dered an excfption to tins remark. Biit when 
it is known that it yields only about 1200 dol- 
I lars annually, and is divided among sevcntern 
' conferences containing- 1272 preachers, be- 
I sides a number of widows, it may be asked, 
I Jl'hat is that among so many?

their own districts with Bibles and Tes- 
taments, they shall agree to place their 
sui-plus funds at the disposal of this 
society. 

9. The annual meeting of the society 
shall be held on the third Monday in

that purpose, shall preside. . 

12. The minutes of each meeting shall 
be signed by the chairman. 

13. The treasurer of this society, un- 
der the direction of the board of mana- 
gers, shall give infonnation to the su-

tiie managers judge it expedient, of the 



state of the fiinds and of the amount for 

which drafts may be made thereon, for 
the missionaiy purposes contemplated 
by this constitution ; agreeably to which 
mformation, the superintendents shall 
have authority to draw on the ti-easurer 
for the same, and to pay over the 
amount to the missionary or missiona- 
ries appointed by them, either wholly at 
once, or by mstalments, at the discre- 
tion of the superintendents ; provided 
the drafts of all the superintendents to- 
gether shall not amount to more tlian

thereafter to the board of managers for 
insertion in their annual report. 

14. This constitution shall not be al- 
tered but by the general conference, on 
the recommendation of the board of 
managers." 

A number of auxiliary and branch 
societies have been formed, and their 
number is hicreasing. In 1819 a mission 
was established among the Wyandoti 
Indians at Upper Sandusky ; and in 1821 
another among the Creeks. Several 
other missionaries are employed in des- 
titute parts of the country under the pa- 
tronage of tire society. 

Doctrines of. — At the time of the or- 
ganization of the church, the following 
articles of religion were adopted as the 
doctrines of the chui'ch : — 

I. Of Faith in the Holy Trinity. — 
" There is but one living and ti'ue God, 
everlasting, without body or parts, of in- 
finite power, wisdom, and goodness ; the 
maker and preserver of all things, visi- 
ble and invisible. — And in unity of this 
Godhead, there are three persons, of 
one substance, power, and eternity ; — 
the Fathei-, the Son, and the Holy 
Ghost. 

II. Of the Word, or Son of God, nvho 
nvas made xiery Man. — The Son, who 
is the Woi'd of the Father, the very and 
eternal God, of one substance with the 
Father, took man's nature in the womb 
of the blessed virgin ; so that two whole 
and perfect natures, that is to say, the 
Godliead and manhood, were joined to- 
gether in one person, never to be divi- 
ded, whereof is one Christ, very God 
and very man, who truly suffered, was 



MET 



609 



MET 



cnicified, dead and buried, to reconcile 
his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, 
not only for original guilt, but also for 
actual sins of men. 

III. Of the Resurrection of Christ. — 
Christ dfid truly rise again from the 
dead, and took again his body, with all 
things appertaining to the perfection of 
man's nature, wherewith he ascended 
into heaven, and there sitteth until he 
return to judge all men at the last day. 

IV. Of the Holy G/^os/.— The Holy 
Ghost, pix)ceeding from the Father and 
the Son, is of one substance, majesty, 
and glory with the Father and the Son, 
very and eternal God. 

V. The sufficiency of the Holy Scriji- 
tures for Salvation. — The Holy Scrip- 
tures contain all things necessary to sal- 
vation : so that whatsoever is not read 
therein, nor may be proved thereby, is 
not to be required of any man, that it 
should be believed as an article of faith, 
or be thought requisite or necessary to 
salvation. In the name of the Holy 
Scripture, we do understand those ca- 
nonical books of the Old and New Tes- 
tament, of whose authority was never 
any doubt in the church. 

The names of the canonical Books. — 
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus. Numbers, 
Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, the 
First Book of Samuel, the Second Book 
of Samuel, the First Book of Kings, the 
Second Book of Kings, the First Book 
of Chronicles, the Second Book of Chro- 
nicles, the Book of Ezra, the Book of 
Nehemiah, the Book of Esther, the Book 
of Job, the Psalms, the Proverbs, Ec- 
cJesiastes, or the Preacher, Cantica, or 
Songs of Solomon, Four Prophets the 
greater, Twelve Prophets the less : all 
the books of the New Testament, as 
they are commonly received, we do re- 
ceive and account canonical. 

VI. Of the Old Testament.— T\veO\di 
Testament is not contrary to the New ; 
for both in the Old and New Testa- 
ment, everlasting life is offered to man- 
kind by Christ, who is the only Media- 
tor between God and man, being both 
God and man. Wherefore, they are not 

o be heard, who feign that the old Fa- 
thers did look only for transitory pro- 
mises. Although the law given from 
God by Moses, as touching ceremonies, 
and rites, doth not bind Christians, nor 
ought the civil precepts thereof of ne- 
cessity be received in any common- 
wealth: yet, notwithstanding, no Chris- 
tian whatsoever is free from the obedi- 
ence of the commandments, which are 
called moral. 

VII. Of Original or Birth Sin. — Ori- 
ginal sin standeth not in the following of 



Adam (as the Pelagians do vainly talk) 
but it is the cori'uption of the nature or 
every man, that naturally is engendered 
of the offspring of Adam, whereby man 
is very far gone from original righteous- 
ness, and of his own nature inclined to 
evil, and that continuallv. 

VIII. Of Free- JVill.—The condition 
of man after the fall of Adam is such, 
that he cannot turn and prepare him- 
self, by his own natural strength and 
works, to faith, and calling upon God ; 
wherefore we have no power to do good 
works, pleasant and acceptable to God, 
without the grace of God by Christ pre- 
venting us, that we may have a good 
will, and working with us, when we 
have that good will. 

IX. Of the Justification of Man. — 
We are accounted righteous before 
God only for the merit of our Lord and 
Saviour Jesus Christ by faith, and not for 
our own works or deservings ; — where- 
fore, that we are justified by faith only, 
is a most wholesome doctrine and very 
full of comfort. 

X. Of Good Works. — Although good 
works which are the fruits of faith, and 
follow after justification, cannot put 
away our sins, and endure the severity 
of God's judgments: yet are they pleas- 
ing and acceptable to God in Christ, 
and spring out of a time and lively faith, 
insomuch that by them a. lively faith 
may be as evidently known, as a tree is 
discerned bv its fruits. 

XI. Of f-Vbrks of Supererogation. — ■ 
Voluntary works, besides, over and 
above God's commandments, which are 
called works of supererogation, cannot 
be taught without arrogancy and im- 
piety. For by them men do declare, 
that they do not only render unto God 
as much as they are bound to do, but; 
that they do more for his sake than of 
bounden duty is required : whereas 
Christ saith plainly. When ye have 
done all that is commanded you, say. 
We are unprofitable servants. 

XII. Of Sin after Justification. — Not 
every sin willingly committed after jus- 
tification, is the sin against the Holy- 
Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore 
the grant of repentance is not to be de- 
nied to such as fall into sin after justifi- 
cation: after we have received the Holy 
Ghost, we may depart from grace given, 
and fall into sin, and by the grace of 
God, rise again and amend our lives. 
And therefore, they are to be condemn- 
ed, who say they can no moi-e sin as 
long as they live here ; or deny the place 
of forgiveness to such as truly repent. 

Xlfl. Of the Church— The visible 
church of^Chi-ist is a congregation of 
4H 



MET 



610 



MET 



faithful men, in wliich the pure word of 
God is preached, and the sacraments 
duly administered according to Christ's 
ordinance, in all those things that of ne- 
cessity are requisite to the same. 

XIV. Of Purgatory. — The Romish 
doctrine concerning purgatory, pardon, 
i\ orshipping, and adoration, as well of 
images as of relics, and also invocation 
of saints, is a fond thing, vainly invent- 
ed, and grounded upon no wairant of 
Scripture, but repugnant to the word of 
God. 

XV. Of speaking in the congregation 
in such a tongue as the peofile under- 
stand. — It is a thing plainly repugnant 
to the word of God, and the custom of 
the primitive church, to have public 
prayer in the church, or to minister the 
sacraments, in a tongue not understood 
by the people. 

XVI. Of the Sacraynents. — Sacra- 
ments ordamed of Christ, are not only 
badges or tokens of Christian men's 
profession : but rather they are certain 
signs of grace, and God's good will to- 
wards us, by the which he doth work 
invisibly in us, and duth not only quick- 
en, but also strengthen and confirm our 
faith hi him. 

There are two sacraments ordained 
of Christ our Lord in the Gospel ; that 
is to say. Baptism and the Supper of the 
Lord. 

Those five commonly called sacra- 
ments ; that is to say, confirmation, pe- 
nance, orders, matrimony, and extreme 
unction, are not to be counted for sa- 
craments of the Gospel, being such as 
have partly grown out of the corrupt 
following of the apostles : and partly are 
states of life allowed in the Scriptures, 
but yet have not the like nature of Bap- 
tism and the Lord's Supper, because 
they have not any visible sign, or cere- 
mony ordained of God. 

The sacraments were not ordained of 
Christ to be gaze:d upon, or to be car- 
ried about ; but that we shoald duly use 
them. And in such only as worthily re- 
ceive the same, they have a wholesome 
effect or operation : but they that re- 
ceive them unworthily, purchase to 
themselves condemnation, as St. Paul 
saith, 1 Cor. xi. 29. 

XVII. Of Baptism. — Baptism is not 
only a sign of profession, and mark of 
difference, whereby Christians are dis- 
tinguished from others that are not bap- 
tized; but it is also a sigTi of regenera- 
tion, or the new birth. The baptism of 
young children is to be retained in the

XVIII. Of the Lord's Supper— The 
Supper of tne Loi-d is not only a sign 



that Christians ought to have among 
themselves one to another, but rather 
is a sacrament of our redemption by 
Christ's death ; insomuch, that to such 
as rightly, worthily, and with faith re- 
ceixe the same, the bread which we 
break is a partaking of the body of 
Christ ; and likewise the cup of blessing 
is a partaking of the blood of Christ. 

Transubstantiation, or the change of 
the substance of bread and wine in the 
supper of our Lord, cannot be proved 
by holy writ, but is repugnant to the 
plain words of Scripture, overthroweth 
the nature of a sacrament, and hath 
given occasion to many superstitions. 

The body of Christ is given, taken, 
and eaten in the supper, only after a 
heavenly and scriptural manner. And 
the means whereby the body of Christ 
is received and eaten in the supper, is 
faith. 

The sacrainent of the Lord's supper 
was not by Christ's ordinance reserv- 
ed, earned about, lifted up, or worship- 
ped. 

XIX. Of both A-mc?s.— The cup of the 
Lord is not to be denied to the iay-peo- 
ple : for both tlie parts of the Lord's 
supper by Christ's ordiniuice and com- 
mandment, ought to be administered to 
all Christians alike. 

XX. Of the one Oblation of Christ, 
finished upon the cross. — The offering 
of Christ once made, is that perfect re- 
demption, propitiation, and satisfaction 
for all the sins of the whole world, both 
original and actual : and there is none 
other satisfaction for sin but that alone. 
Wherefore the sacrifice of masses, in 
the which it is commonly said, that the 
priest doth offer Christ for the quick 
and the dead, to have remission of pain 
or guilt, is a blasphemous fable, and 
dangerous deceit. 

XXI. Of the Marriage of Ministers. 
— The ministers of Christ are not com- 
manded by God's law either to vow the 
estate of single life, or to abstain from 
marriage ; therefoi-e it is lawful for 
them, as for all other Christians to 
marry at their own discretion, as they 
shall judge the same to serve best to 
godliness. 

XXII. Of the Rites and Ceremonies 
of churches. — It is not necessary that 
rites and ceremonies should in all places 
be the same, or exactly alike : for they 
have been always different, and may be 
changed according to the diversity of 
countries, times, and men's manners, so 
that nothing be ordained against God's 
word. — Whosoever, through his private 
judgment, willingly and purposely doth 
openly break the rites and ceremonies

of the church to which he belongs, 
which are not repugnant to the word of 
Goci, and are ordained and approved by 
common authority, ought to be rebuked 
openly, that others may fear to do the 
IJKe, as one that ofFendeth against the 
common order of the church, and 
woundeth the consciences of weak 
brethren. 

Every particular church may ordain, 
change, or abolish rites and ceremonies, 
so that all things may be done to edifi- 
cation. 

XXIII. Of the Rulers of the United 
States of jimerica. — The president, the 
congress, the general assemblies, the 
governors, and the councils of state, as 
the delegates of the fieofxle, are the ru- 
lers of the United States of America, 
according to the division of power made 
to them by the constitution of the Uni- 
ted States, and by the constitutions of 
their respective states. And the said 
states are a sovereign and independent 
nation, and ought not to be subject to 
any foreign jurisdiction.* 

XXIV.' Of Christian Men's Goods.— 
The riches and goods of Christians are 
not common as touching the right, title, 
and possession of the same, as some do 
falsely boast. Notwithstanding, every 
man ought, of such things as he pos- 
sesseth, liberally to give alms to the 
poor, according to his abilitv. 

XXV. Of a' Christian Alan's Oath. — 
As we contess that vain and rash swear- 
ing is forbidden Christian men by our 
Lord Jesus Christ and James his apos- 
tle ; so we judge that the Christian re- 
ligion doth not prohibit but that a man 
may swear when the magistrate re- 
quireth, in a cause of faith and charity, 
so it be done according to the prophet's 
teaching, in justice, judgment, and 
truth." 

Government of. — The general rules 
for the government of the societies, are 
the same as those in England, termed, 
" The nature, desigyi, and general rules 
of our United Societies." (See Metho- 
dists, government and discipline of, p. 
365.) As to the government, the title 
sufficiently ascertains its distinctive 



* As far as it respects civil affairs, we be- 
lieve it the duty of Christians, and especially 
all Christian niinistei's, to be subject to the su- 
preme authority of the country where they 
maj' reside, and to use all laudable means to 
enjoin obedience to the powers thai be: and 
therefore it is expected that all our preachers 
and people, who may be under the British or 
any other government, will behave themselves 
»s peaceable and orderly subjects. 



character, it being, in fact and nam«, 
E/iiscofial. Three orders of ministers 
arc recognized, and the duties peculiar 
to each are clearly defined. 

But to give a correct view of the 
ministry of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, it is necessary to show the 
manner in which it is formed. A man 
thinking himself moved by the Holy 
Ghost to preach the Gospel, first makes 
known his views and exercises to the 
preacher having charge of the circuit 
or station, who, if he judge the appli- 
cant a fit person, grants him license to 
exhort. After improving his talent as 
an exhorter, a sufficient length of time 
for his brethren to judge of his compe- 
tency to so important a work, he makes 
application to the quarterly meeting 
conference, which is composed of all 
the preachers, travelling and local, 
stewards, leaders and exhorters of the 
circuit, and if considered fit for the work, 
he is recommended by this body to the 
local preachers' conference, where he 
is examined on his belief in the doctrines 
and discipline of the church ; and they, 
if they think proper, grant him license 
as a local preacher ; and if such licen- 
tiate desire to enter the travelling mi- 
nistry, he must be recommended to an 
annual conference, both by a quarterly 
meeting and district conference, except 
in those circuits where no district con- 
ference is held. When presented to an 
annual conference, his reception on trial, 
depends on a majority of votes. After 
travelling as a preacher on probation 
two_ years, if no objection be made 
against him, he is admitted as a member 
of conference, and ordained a deacon. 
The approved exercise of the deacon's 
office tor two years, entitles him to the 
office of an elder. 

The following quotations from the 
Methodist Discipline, will show the du- 
ties peculiar to each order of ministers 
in their church : —

For the particular duties of preachers, 
to God, to themselves and each other, 
as well as to the people of their charge, 
see Discipline, sections, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 
15, 16, 17. 

Besides the travelling ministry, the 
Methodists have a large and useful body 
of ministers, whom they distinguish by 
the name of local fireachers. These at- 
tend to secular business for a livelihood ; 
and preach generally on Sabbath days, 
and occasionally, as time and opportu- 
nity will permit, on other days. The 
following section from the discipline 
will clearly show their duties, powers, 
and privileges: 

Of the Local Preachers. 
Quest. 1. What directions shall be 
given concerning local preachers. 

Ansiv. 1. There shall be held annual- 
ly in each presiding elder's district, 
a district conference, of which all the 
local preachers in the district, who shall 
have been licensed two years, shall be 
members; and of which the presiding 
elder of the district for the time being 
shall be president ; or in case of his ab- 
sence, the conference shall have autho- 
rity to elect a president pro tem. It shall 
be the duty of the presiding elder of 
each district to appoint the time and 
place of the first conference, after which 
the presiding elder shall appoint the 
time, and the conference the place of 
its own sitting. 

2. The said district conference shall 
have authority to license proper per- 
sons to preach, and renew their license ; 
to recommend suitable candidates to the 
annual conference for deacons or el- 
ders' orders, in the local connexion, for 
admission on trial in the travelling con- 
nexion, and to try, suspend, expel,' or 
acquit any local preacher in the district 
against whom charges may be brought. 
Provided, that no person shall be li- 



censed without being first recommended 
by the quarterly conference of the cir- 
cuit or station to which he belongs ; nor 
shall any one be licensed to preach, or 
recommended to the annual conference 
for ordination, without first being ex- 
amined in the district conference on the 
subjects of doctrine, and discipline. 

3. The district conference shall take 
cognizance of all the local preachers in 
the district, and shall inquire into the 
gifts, labours, and usefulness of each 
preacher by name. 

4. When charges are preferred against 
any local preacher, it shall be the duty 
of the preacher in charge to call a com- 
mittee consisting of three or more local 
preachers within the station, circuit, or 
district, before whom it shall be the 
duty of the accused to appear, and by 
whom he shall be acquitted, or, if found 
guilty, be suspended until the meeting 
of the next district conference. And 
the president of the said district con- 
ference shall, at the commencement of 
the trial, appoint a secretary, who shall 
take down regular minutes of the evi- 
dence, and proceedings of the trial ; 
which minutes, when read and approved^ 
shall be signed by the said president, 
and also by the members of the said 
district conference, or by a majority of 
them. 

And in case of condemnation, the 
local preacher, deacon, or elder, con- 
demned, shall be allowed an ajjpeal to 
the next annual conference, provided 
that he signify to the said district con- 
ference, his determination to appeal ; 
in which case the said president shall 
lay the minutes of the trial above-men- 
tioned before the said animal conference, 
at which the local preacher, deacon, or 
elder, so appealing may appear : and 
the said annual conference shall judge 
and finally determine from the minutes 
of the said trial, so laid before them. 

5. A licensed local preacher shall be 
eligible to the office of a deacon, after 
he has preached for four years from the 
time he received a regular license, and 
has obtained a testimonial from the dis- 
trict conference to which he belongs, 
after proper examination, signed by the 
president, and countersigned by the se- 
cretary, and his character has passed 
in examination before, and he has ob- 
tained the approbation of the annual 
conference. 

6. A local deacon shall be eligible to 
the office of an elder, after he has 
preached four years from the time he 
was ordained a deacon, and has obtain- 
ed a recommendation from the district 
conference of which Ue is a member.

certifying his qualificiations in doctrine, 
discipline, talents and usefulness, and 
the necessity of his official services as 
an elder in the circuit where he resides ; 
signed by the president, and counter- 
signed by the secretary. He shall, if he 
cannot attend, send to' the annual con- 
ference such recommendation, and a 
•note certifying his belief in the doc- 
trine and discipline of our church : the 
whole being examined by the annual 
conference, and if approved he may be 
erdained ; provided, nevertheless, no 
slave holder shall be eligible to the of- 
fice of an elder or deacon, where the 
laws will admit of emancipation, and 
permit the liberated slave to enjoy free- 
dom. 

7. Every local elder, deacon, and 
preacher, shall have his name recorded 
on the journal of the quarterly meeting 
conference of which he is a' member. 
And every local preacher shall have 
his name enrolled on a class paper, and 
meet in class, if the distance of his place 
of residence from any class be not too 
great; or, in neglect' thereof, the dis- 
trict conference, if they judge it proper, 
may deprive him of his ministerial office. 

V\'henever a local preacher shall re- 
move from one circuit to another, he 
shall procure from the presiding elder 
of the district, or the pi-eacher having 
the charge of the circuit, a cei'tificate 
of his official standing in the church at 
the time of his removal, without which 
he shall not be received as a local 
preacher in other places. 

No preacher among us shall distil or 
retail spirituous liquors, without forfeit- 
ing his official standing." 

The supreme legislative power of the 
church is concentrated in a general 
conference, which is composed of dele- 
gates from each annual conference, who 
meet together on the first day of May 
of every fourth year. For its powers 
see under history of. In addition to the 
powers there enumerated, the general 
conference possesses an appellate juris- 
diction over all ministers who may have 
appealed from the decisions of an annual 
conference, and the final determination 
of all disputes that may arise on any 
question of rights, which relate either to 
the people or preachers ; elects and 
fixes the salary of the book agents ; 
elects the bishops, and may create any 
new, or di\ide any of the old annual 
eonferences. 

l"o the annual conference is com- 
mitted the oversight, in subordination 
to the episcopal authority,, of all the 
preachers and people within their re- 
spective bounds, the standing of their 



own members, the hearing of appeals 
of local preachers, and the original 
jurisdiction of the members of their 
own bodies, and the adoption of such 
measures as they may think expedient, 
for raising monies to carry on the work 
of God. The following questions will 
show the powers and privileges, as well 
as the particular business of an annual 
conference : — 

Of the Amiual Conferences. 

" Quest. 3. Who shall attend the 
yeai'ly conferences i* 

.Aiisiu. All the travelling preachers, 
who are in full connexion, and those 
who are to be received into full con- 
nexion.

of holding the yearly conference ? 

jinsnv. The bishops; but they shall 
allow the annual conferences to sit a

Quest. 5. Who shall appoint the place 
of holding the annual conferences ?

Anew. The electing and ordaining of 
deacons and elders. 

Quest. 8. Are there any other direc- 
tions to be given concerning the yearly 
conferences ? 

Jlnsiii. There shall be twelve con- 
ferences in the year. A record of the 
proceedings of each annual conference 
shall be kept by a secretary, chosen for 
that purpose, and shall be signed by the 
president and secretary : and let a copy 
of the said record be sent to the general 
conference. 

Supfiort of the ministi'y. — The minis- 
try is supported by the voluntaiy con- 
tributions of the people. For this pur- 
pose, a collection is made in all the 
classes and large congregations in the 
country circuits once a quarter ; in the 
cities. In addition to the quaiterly col- 
lections, a monthly, and in some cities 
a weekly collection is made, which is 
delivered into the hands of the stewards 
at each leaders' meeting, or at the 
quarterly meeting of the circuit : the 
stewards keep a record of all monies 
collected, and the manner in which they 
are appropriated. 

Character of. — Each denomination of 
Christians have some peculiarity of 
character, by which it is distinguished 
from others. And the preceding outline 
of the Methodist Episcopal Church will, 
it is presumed, enable the reader to 
form a tolerably correct idea of its cha- 
racteristic distinction. And those who 
have witnessed the rise and progress of 
the church, in the midst of a variety of 
reproaches and oppositions, will be 
ready to admit that a remarkable zeal 
for the salvation of souls, has distin- 
guished the Methodist ministry from 
the beginning ; and that this zeal, tem- 
pered with love to God and man, has 



evinced itself by an extended and per- 
severing plan of difhising the Gospelj 
by an itinerating ministry ; and also by 
a success in the awakening and conver- 
sion of souls, scarcely to be paralleled 
in ecclesiastical histoiy, since the apos- 
tolic age. These are facts known and 
read of all men. And no less evident 
has been their own personal devotion to 
the cause of God and to the interests of 
Jesus Christ. 

That particulai; doctrine, which has 
characterized all their preaching is, sal- 
vation by grace through faith in the 
atoning merits of Christ ; and no less 
strenuously have they enforced the ne- 
cessity of holiness of heart and life, or 
the entire sanctification of the soul and 
body to God. And bating somewhat for 
the enthusiasm of some, the ignorance 
and irregularity of others, perhaps it is 
not too much to say, that no sect of Chris- 
tians have maintained a more unexcep- 
tionable character, for strict adherence 
to the precepts of Christ. 

To undertake to estimate the com- 
parative merits of the several sects of 
Christians might seem invidious ; and it 
would be equally so, to draw a general 
conclusion, either for or against any 
body of people from the conduct of a 
few individuals. All, however bright 
they may have shone, have had their 
spots ; and it is granted without any 
disparagement to the character of the 
mam body, that there have been indi- 
viduals among the Methodists who have 
disgraced themselves and their bre- 
thren ; while the great majority of both 
preachers and people, have evinced 
deep devotion to God, and an ardent at- 
tachment to truth and holiness, and 
have done much to advance the king- 
dom of Chiist among men.
