<h1>Religion 2.00</h1>

<h2>Jon Bosak (bosak@eng.sun.com)<br>October 6, 1998</h2>

<p>This is religion.200, a group of four religious works marked up for
electronic publication from publicly available sources.  The texts
were originally marked up (1992) as an exercise in SGML DTD and style
sheet design, and in 1996 were released along with a companion
Shakespeare set as the earliest examples of real documents marked up
in XML.  The current distribution conforms to the XML 1.0
Recommendation released February 8, 1998.</p>

<h3>Copyright</h3>

<p>It has been my intention from the beginning that this set should
always be made available as a set rather than as individual works.
Each of the four "testaments" in the set now bears the following
notices:

<blockquote>
SGML version by Jon Bosak, 1992-1994<br>
XML version by Jon Bosak, 1996-1998<br>
The XML markup and added material in this version are
Copyright &#169; 1998 Jon Bosak
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The set of which this work is a part may freely be distributed on
condition that it not be modified or altered in any way.  The
individual works making up the set -- <i>The Old Testament, The
New Testament, The Quran,</i> and <i>The Book of Mormon</i> --
cannot be distributed separately without violating the terms under
which the set is made available.
</blockquote>

<h3>What's new</h3>

<p>Version 2.00 differs significantly from the previous release,
version 1.10.  Some new material has been added, and the markup and
associated DTD have been substantially revised.</p>

<p>The most important change is the removal of verse numbers.  The
previous markup was designed simply to delimit the original ASCII
texts I started with in 1992.  This new version is intended to
exercise the ability of style sheets to supply basic features such as
generated numbers and tables of contents.  Since the particular texts
making up the set are taken as canonical and unchanging, verse numbers
and tables of contents can be generated, so there is no need to
include them in the markup.  DSSSL stylesheets are included with the
texts themselves to demonstrate the concept.  Supporting files needed
to generate RTF output using the style sheets in conjunction with the
Jade DSSSL engine are also provided.</p>

<h3>Manifest</h3>

<h3>Running the scripts</h3>

<p>The files in this set were built and tested in Windows 95 using
scripts running under the Gnu bash shell.  They should work equally
well using DOS batch files, but I don't have the patience to deal with
them.  The same installation has also been tested under Solaris (using
ksh instead of bash) and should work with other versions of Unix as
well.</p>

<p>Assuming that nsgmls (part of the Jade distribution) has been
installed and is in the search path, the scripts named vs and vx are
called from the parent directory like this:</p>

<pre>
   vs ot
   vx ot
</pre>

<p>In these examples, the vs script performs a validity check of the
ot/ot.xml file as an SGML file, and the vx script performs a validity
check of the same file as an XML file.  Note that both scripts change
the values of SP environment variables.</p>

<p>Assuming that Jade (http://www.jclark.com/jade) has been installed
and is in the search path, the scripts named rtfn and rtfl are called
from the parent directory like this:</p>

<pre>
   rtfn nt 2
   rtfl quran 1
</pre>

<p>In these examples, the rtfn script calls jade using the style sheet
for two-level testaments to produce a normal-type RTF version of
nt/nt.xml, and the rtfl script calls jade using the style sheet for
one-level testaments to produce a large-type RTF version of
quran/quran.xml.  A one-level testament such as the Quran has just one
level of containment (the sura) above the verse level.  Two-level
testaments such as the Old Testament and the New Testament have two
levels of containment (books and chapters) above the verse level.
Note that the Book of Mormon contains both chapters and suras.</p>

<p>The buildall script calls vs, vx, rtfn, and rtfl to validate and
make both RTF versions of all four XML files.</p>

<h3>About the style sheets</h3>

<p>The style sheets provided in this distribution produce results that
leave a lot to be desired, especially in the areas of column-balancing
and TOC formatting.  This is due partly to limitations in RTF, partly
to limitations in Jade, partly to limitations in my skill, and partly
to a desire to keep them simple.  They are not intended as examples of
fine quality typography but rather as demonstrations of basic concepts
using freely available tools.  It is my intention to use these style
sheets as the basis for explorations into XSL as that standard begins
to solidify.</p>
